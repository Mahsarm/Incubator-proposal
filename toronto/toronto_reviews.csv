Katsuya,"Rarely to I get excited by katsu, but Katsuya really delivered a memorable dish!I came for a weekday lunch with my work team and everyone was delightfully surprised and enjoyed a great meal. The main staple of the menu is the katsu (a breaded thin piece of pork or chicken) but Katsuya takes it to the next level. The katsu can be stuffed with cheese, come in a burger or with noodles. The traditional rice option comes with a wide selection of sauces, from creamy carbonara to spicy tomato-garlic to sweet curry. I went traditional and had the Original Japanese Katsu. The katsu was done perfectly, crunchy on the outside while the meat was still moist and juicy. I appreciated the attention to detail in this dish. The katsu rests on a metal grate so it didn't get soggy through the meal. There is a little mortar and pestle to grind up the sesame seeds for the soft white rice. The little pile of cabbage cuts through the grease as you make your way through the meal. Also the portion size here is big! More than enough for lunch and a delicious snack later on. The service is great, helpful and friendly at all times. Definitely would recommend.",4.0,5.0,136,2018-01-19,43.660047,-79.378802,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Katsuya,"The portions given and the price you pay for is very reasonable. Lots of food for the price - it was also delicious! If you checked in, you were able to get a free pop as well. The chicken katsu was so filling and big - I didn't think it was possible. The pictures definitely don't do justice! I was here for lunch on a weekday which it wasn't too bad when it comes to lineups and waits. The environment was relatively louder however it was still manageable to talk to the person ahead of you. They have a good selection of food as well which I would definitely try again in the future if I go back. Though it is a little out of the way for me, very close to Ryerson university for the students.Overall it is worth giving it a try if you haven't before. Staff was nice and friendly as well.",4.0,4.0,136,2018-01-28,43.660047,-79.378802,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Katsuya,"We dropped by for an early Saturday lunch, since nearby Kaiju has closed and we were craving katsu. The restaurant itself is well lit with plenty of communal seating and an open kitchen which is pretty cool. I ordered the hot and spicy chicken, and my friend ordered the regular pork tenderloin. The food arrived quickly and was piping hot. The meats were good, and the tempura coating added a decent amount of crunch. General consensus was that the chicken was more flavourful than the pork. I liked the hot and spicy curry, although for some reason it had a very tomato-like flavour. I tried the regular curry and it looked and tasted like turkey gravy. If I'm honest, the curry was the most disappointing part of both our meals. Both dishes came with rice and coleslaw. The sesame dressing at the table is absolutely delicious and I found myself adding more a couple of times.Total cost for two - $38 including tax and tip. This is not cheap, especially given that we didn't have any sides or anything to drink. The portions were very large, however, so you could definitely take some home if you're not super hungry. I'll come back to try some of the other curry options, but at $20 a person I won't be coming here every day!",4.0,3.0,136,2018-01-21,43.660047,-79.378802,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Katsuya,"Krazy for Katsu at Katsuya! I came here last night with my sister after reading all these wonderful reviews and looking at the mouthwatering pictures. It was about 5 pm and we were able to be seated right away, but it was busy as there is limited seating. To start we got Cheese Crabmeat  Croquettes and Takoyaki. Both were delicious! They give you a bowl of miso soup after you order which I thought had a great miso flavour, better than many restaurants. I got the Hot Spicy Cheese Katsu and my sister got the Cheese Katsu burger. I loved the hot spicy sauce, it had a good spice level and a nice chili flavour. My sister really enjoyed her burger and would get it again. It was messy to eat though, so a fork and knife seems required which they provided when they brought her plate. She got the combo which comes with fries and a pop so I had a couple fries to try and they were nicely coated and crispy. Everything was beautifully presented, tasted great, and service was friendly and quick. There are lots of different sauces to choose from and you can get pork, chicken, or fish. The portion size is also good for what you are paying.  Location is a plus for me as it's close to my work. Will definitely be returning and telling everyone to try this place!",4.0,5.0,136,2017-12-20,43.660047,-79.378802,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Katsuya,"Great quick bite in the GTA. Portions are huge for lunch, be sure to go on an empty stomach or go for dinner. There is no specific ""lunch"" menu so the portion and price is the same for dinner. I tried the carbonara pork tender which I loved. Would recommend that dish. The carbonara complemented the dish well with a hint of spice.Tip: free pop when you check in yelp!",4.0,4.0,136,2018-01-17,43.660047,-79.378802,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Katsuya,"Do you love katsu? Then go here. There is no competition, and it is hands down the best katsu restaurant in Toronto. I am glad that it is somewhat far away from where I live or else I would be eating here everyday and would double in size.Katsu is a balancing act between the crust and the meat and most katsu restaurants don't have the right balance - they either have too thin of a crust with too much meat lacking that crunch that you want from katsu, or there is too much crust and not enough meat which ends up tasting like you're eating fried batter (which could be what some people enjoy). Katsuya is the perfect balance to me, just enough crunch, and the right thickness of the meat to give it that juicy umami flavour. Nothing compares to it in my opinion.There are a lot of different options for the katsu, ranging not only in the meats but also with the side sauce. You could choose from curry to their special Katsuya sauce (which I think is quite similar to demi-glace) or just a regular traditional katsu which all comes with sliced cabbage, rice, and miso soup. I do warn you though, their portions are quite massive, and I often have a hard time finishing it all despite having a fairly large appetite.I can tell that the restaurant is catching on and more and more people are realizing the perfection that is Katsuya. Lines are starting to form, and the restaurant is getting crowded, and I'm sure this review isn't going to help ease that any time soon. It's not a hype so it likely won't die down, it's actually legit good.Hopefully they will open another downtown location to ease some of the traffic in the near future, but for now this is your go-to spot for katsu in Toronto, nothing else comes close.",4.0,5.0,136,2017-12-07,43.660047,-79.378802,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Katsuya,"A new absolute favourite.For me this place is one of those random discoveries that only happen every once in a while - it was a lucky day! I had been having a Katsu craving for weeks and this place met all my craving needs and then some.There is a wide variety of plates and katsu varieties to choose from - I decided to try the Terri Mayo Katsu and oooh boy. Perfect Teriyaki sauce, meat was tender and perfectly cooked, the mayo added a spot-on creamy texture and the bonito flakes on top gave a really interesting crunchy touch to the plate. I am still surprised that I came here with a friend during lunch hour and the place was not busy at all - we were immediately seated and service was excellent and quick.Curious to try the curry Katsu next time :)",4.0,5.0,136,2017-12-07,43.660047,-79.378802,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Katsuya,"Nice restaurant, supreme service, and excellent food. Came here for lunch and luckily it's not busy. Their bread crumbs are made in-house and made daily. I got the original sauce chicken Katsu and sweet chilli pork tender Katsu. Love them both as both Katsu are crispy and fluffy and not oily. Meats are tender and juicy. Overall food is very good. Will try other flavors.For the service, girl greeted us with good smile and very attentive. She even ask if we want more miso soup which other place will never asked you that.Overall, I'll highly recommend to come try this place if you are around the area. The price is reasonable and very good portion, and again food is good. Definitely will come back and hope service and food will still good",4.0,5.0,136,2017-12-04,43.660047,-79.378802,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Katsuya,"I've been to the North York location, and this place is just as good! My favourite is the crab-cheese appetizer. The katsu here is really good and always fried perfectly. I always get the sauce on the side so that the katsu doesn't get soggy. It comes with unlimited refills of rice, cabbage and soup.They don't take reservations and seating is limited so I suggest calling ahead before going over to see how busy they are. There is also no time limit for sitting there so I had a great time catching up with friends here.",4.0,5.0,136,2018-01-12,43.660047,-79.378802,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Katsuya,"I finally ventured this side of the city for dinner! Upon entering, it looked more spacious than other katsu places - clean, airy and well-lit. The staff were welcoming and quick to escort us to our sits. As we were deciding what to eat, the server brought us water and after some time we ordered pork loin with cheese original, chicken original and takoyaki to start.When the takoyaki came in, I could immediately tell that it was going to be delicious - it was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with a generous piece of octopus and katsuobushi on top. So when our mains came in, I had an expectation that it was also going to be yummy. The portions are substantial, definitely larger than other katsu places in Toronto - it was a bit oily towards the last few bites. Our server was attentive and came to ask a few times if we wanted more rice, miso soup or cabbage salad. Overall, a hearty meal and worth another visit!",4.0,4.0,136,2017-12-05,43.660047,-79.378802,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Katsuya,"Came in on a Monday at lunch and it wasn't really busy. Really enjoy the environment. Though I'm not a fan of bench seating because it's obviously uncomfortable, the food and service makes up for it.Tried the Spicy garlic pork katsu with cheese. It was massive, the pics don't show how massive the cutlet is. Meat was juicy, lots of flavour in the sauce and tons of fried cheesy garlic goodness.Overall a nice experience with great service, would come back, but its an expensive lunch, was $17 before tax/tip for lunch.",4.0,5.0,136,2017-11-13,43.660047,-79.378802,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Katsuya,"Katsuya, like the name suggests, primarily serves different types of katsu (breaded deep fried meat cutlets).I was most impressed with the size of the meal. While manageable for one, it is guaranteed to leave you stuffed! I ordered the chicken katsu curry here. While I enjoyed the overal taste, I felt like the batter did not hold its own when mixed with curry, as the skin would lose its crunch and would fall apart from the meat when I try to pick up a pieceMy first experience here was pleasant, but not outstanding. I would pick Kaijiu over this if it remained open, but perhaps I'll drop by again if I'm feeling a katsu meal.",4.0,3.0,136,2017-11-05,43.660047,-79.378802,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Katsuya,"I'm a huge fan of katsu (mainly chicken) and my cousin who's the total opposite tried out this place and loved it so she suggested for me to try it out. I went here on a Saturday evening around 6pm and I thought it would be really busy but there was no line up and a lot of seats available. I really liked the interior decor of the place, had a nice ambiance to it. We were seated promptly and it didn't take long for us to decide what we wanted. I came with a part of 4 and we've never tried this place before so we all got pork katsu. I actually wanted chicken katsu so I could compare it to another katsu joint but I completely missed it on the menu!! I really wanted to try the one with cheese in it but it was only avail for pork so I didn't even notice the chicken to the left of the menu list. If you check in on Yelp here, you get a free soft drink of your choice. The katsu generally was really good and the portions are HUGE. So if you're super hungry then this place is for you. One katsu had about maybe 8 pieces to it? I only ate 3-4 and I packed the rest home. They curry sauce was very typical so nothing special here but I liked the taste of it. I ordered the katsu with cheese in it and when each piece was pulled apart, you can see the cheese ooze out. The cheese was good, but it was a little bit heavy and too much imo. I wouldn't get double cheese (that is an option on menu) unless you love cheese THAT much.The plate also came with some rice and a salad. The salad sauce was on the table already and the waitress shakes it for you. General stuff here.This place is expensive for lunch but not bad for dinner. You'll probably have to pack it to go because portions are so big. I toasted it in the oven the day after and it still tasted pretty good and crispy! I spent about $20-22 all in with tax and tips but the portions make up for the price and I'm okay with that!I would def come back again to try the other katsus!!",4.0,4.0,136,2017-11-06,43.660047,-79.378802,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Katsuya,"I have never really been a fan of katsu, much to my BF's dismay since he's a katsu eating machine.  However, Katsuya earned two thumbs up from me.  My BF agrees and he's quite a katsu snob, mind you.  We have been to Mr. Tonkatsu from the same owner as Katsuya, but Mr. Tonkatsu was just barely decent to me from what I recall.  Katsuya, on the other hand, seems to up the ante on all aspects from portion size to quality to decor and so forth.  Katsuya has various meats and a host of different styles that you don't find elsewhere in Toronto.  You can even get katsu udon or a katsu burger, so you're sure to have something that peaks your interest here. We ordered the Original and the Spicy Garlic Chilli.  Both came with rice, cabbage, and miso soup, all of which are refillable (for free), so rest assured that you're never going to leave with an empty stomach! Also, as mentioned by other Yelpers, the portion sizes are generous and the meat is tender with light breading.  I did not like the Original's sauce as much as my Spicy Garlic Chilli sauce because the former resembled Thanksgiving gravy for some odd reason.  However, this may just be me because my BF thoroughly enjoyed the Original's sauce.  In the end, both of us concluded that Katsuya serves flavourful, high quality katsu at a fair price and  higher quantity.If you're a light eater, you may want to piggyback on someone else's order and share a katsu set with them.  You get refillable cabbage, miso soup, and rice anyway.  Nevertheless, the best choice is still to get your own set beacuse you won't want to stop eating the katsu.  Keep in mind, however, that the bottom of the katsu gets a tad bit soggy after a while, so don't save it for last. Eat it while it's fresh! I highly recommend everyone to give Katsuya a go! Their seating is limited to smaller groups of 4 and under, though it's not impossible for them to push tables together.  Remember to check in on social media and Yelp for a free can of pop!",4.0,4.0,136,2017-10-24,43.660047,-79.378802,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Katsuya,"I'm not big on katsu- it probably doesn't even crack my top 20, but if it's in front of me, I'll have a piece or two. Katsuya has somewhat changed this for me. I've been wanting to go here after seeing the lineups form around dinner and late-dinner time. It doesn't disappoint. Came here after the lunch rush (around 3pm) and we were seated right away. BF and I shared the fried crabmeat balls and one regular chicken katsu. The fried crabmeat balls had just the right amount of sweet/tangy tartar sauce and they were fried perfectly. The chicken katsu is HUGE. If you have a regular person's appetite, you won't be able to finish it. SPLIT SOMETHING! Trust me. Honestly, we could have gone without the appetizer as we still had a few pieces of katsu and rice leftover between the two of us. This place gets big points for cheap and cheerful. The katsu here is perfect and it starts with the perfect panko crust. The chicken was also surprisingly tender. I'm definitely coming back here- I'm curious to try the pork curry katsu with cheese.

Katsuya,"I came here at 4pm and there was no one here. I ordered the terri mayo pork loin katsu and crab meat croquette. I did not expect the katsu to be so big. I am a big eater but I could not finish both of this and my sister could not either. Service was exceptional as the server kept coming to our table to check up on us, I counted 4 times to be exact. This location is literally next to Ryerson (you can see Kerr Hall outside the window). There are arrows to help lost foodies navigate their way to the restaurant! Highly recommend and I will come back to try the other katsu platters!Terri mayo pork katsu - dang I did not expect this to be so good! As a fan of takoyaki, I was excited to try this platter. I was opting to get the original sauce katsu but when I saw that, I wanted to try it right away. The bonito flakes were a win and that it fit very well with the mayo and pork. There was a bottle of some sort of vinaigrette on the table and the waitress told me that you put that on the cabbage portion of the platter.Crab meat croquette - 5 relatively larges pieces with mayo on top. It had crab meat (of course!), potato and I think cheese in the center. The coating of this appetizer was on a whole other level - hot, very crispy and flaky!P.S. the washrooms are so clean!",4.0,5.0,136,2017-10-19,43.660047,-79.378802,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Katsuya,"Katsu?!?!? Ya!!!! This place is a hidden gem around the corner from izakaya! They have unlimited soup salad and rice with your meal and the service was just amazing. I came here with a group of 27 people on a Sunday after church. They sat us at separate tables which was perfectly reasonable and everybody got their menus and ordered different kinds of katsu. I had the carbonara katsu which was very heavy with cheese and everything came with soup salad and rice. Also ordered the deep fried fresh oysters which was pretty crispy. The servers are really friendly and happy and the portions are enormous! The decor here is very nice and industrial with exposed brick walls and wood stools and chairs. Very appropriate for the ambience here. The location is a bit hidden as it is off of Gerrard and and not church. Food came pretty fast and overall a great experience for a group of 27 people! The only down is the price which is a bit expensive for lunch. Around $18 with tax for one katsu meal. It's pretty big so would recommend sharing the meal with someone else if you're not a big eater. Either way, we will be back!",4.0,4.0,136,2017-10-15,43.660047,-79.378802,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Katsuya,"I love Katsu and this place knows how to do it well! Cute spot, very cozy feel and I almost feel like I'm in an episode of kdrama. This place can seat up to ~30 people. The service was fast and friendly. We went here on a Friday night for a party of 4 and we had to wait 10-15 mins at most for a table. I would suggest looking at the menu while you wait, the menu can get a little overwhelming as they have a LOT of Katsu selection! And btw, it's unlimited miso soup and salad! Once seated, I ordered the cheese Katsu ( poke cutlet stuffed with mozzarella cheese) with garlic! It was fantastic! Ooey Gooey cheese with the light crispy texture of the Katsu was a def craving fulfilled experience! The salad was light and crisp, the miso soup was amazing and not too salty. We also shared the cheese crab croquettes! A def must try!! And the fried oysters were tasty but the oysters were small.

Katsuya,"Hands down the best katsu that I've ever had, and I don't even like katsu. Also, you MUST try their takoyaki, also, hands down the best takoyaki I've ever had! Check in and you get a free pop :) My friend and I came here on a Wednesday evening around 5:45PM. Located at the corner of Church and Gerrard. They weren't too busy, but the place isn't big either. They had about three cooks and one server. When you enter they greet you right away and seat you down. The menus are located on the tables already. The restaurant was super rustic, love the ambience. We ordered the takoyaki to share, my friend ordered one of their chilli garlic katsu ($15), and I ordered their katsu burger (w/cheese - $11 + $3 for combo). They started us off with a bowl of miso soup (complimentary), and you can get refills if you wanted ahah! First came the takoyaki, its basically the takoyaki ball deep fried, it was so yummy and smooth. Next, was the main, super hugemongous portion - can literally be two meals! Everything was great about it, no complaints. Will be back again! ---I went back again! This time with a couple more friends! Since I was sick, instead of killing my throats with the katsus, I stuck with their option of a soup udon with tempura shrimp. Let's just say, stick with the katsu options! The udon was pretty plain, came with two shrimp tempuras and a couple of different fish cakes.",4.0,5.0,136,2017-10-15,43.660047,-79.378802,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Katsuya,"So happy that another katsu place has opened up downtown! Katsuya offers different types of katsu sets, with proteins like pork and chicken served with various sauces to choose from (original sauce, carbonara, chili garlic, spicy garlic, curry, etc.). All of the sets come with unlimited refills of miso soup, cabbage salad, and rice.We came on a Thursday night and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. I reckon they will get more and more popular in the coming days though.  Interior is very cute - rustic with cozy lighting. Service is attentive and friendly. My fiance ordered the carbonara chicken katsu ($17.50) and I ordered the original chicken katsu ($13.50). The chicken was soft and juicy inside the crispy batter. We both got our sauces on the side, which I would recommend as the sauces can get heavy! The carbonara is creamy and comes with tiny pieces of shrimp. The sauce that comes with the original chicken katsu is reminiscent of ketchup and you add self-grinded sesame seeds to it.Yelp pro tips - check in to get a free pop and write a review to get $5 off your next meal!",4.0,5.0,136,2017-10-05,43.660047,-79.378802,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"We were there on a Saturday evening. It was super busy, had to wait 35 minutes to get a table. There is a cozy corner inside the restaurant for waiting, good for winter time. The waiting was worth it. Despite the extreme busyness, drink was served on time. I had ordered Tom Yum Caesar. It was a bit spicy and had the expected punch. Loved it. The food tasted great. We had tried Pad Gra Prow with chicken and Gaeng Masaman with braised beef. Both dishes were very flavourful. I order mine to make Thai spicy. Bad decision! It was super hot (spicy). If you can't handle spice but would like to try anyway then I would suggest you rather go for mild or foreigner spicy. The portion was moderate. The taste of both dishes were very similar to the same dishes in BKK Thai at North York where I am a regular. If you happen to be in this corner (just North of 401 on Yonge, North York) of the city, I suggest you also try BKK Thai. There food is equally good or better minus the crowd and waiting time. Anyway, it's not as vibrant as Pai and one tenth in size.Overall the service was great. Can't ask for more in such a busy time. Glasses of water were served and refilled without asking. Highly appreciated the extra paper napkins on the table; proactive thinking - guests will need them specially if they try their food Thai spicy.

It took us a few weeks to get a reservation. They are good in that they are punctual with their seating even when the place was full. The service was fast and friendly. The food was interesting and appropriately spicy. The place was recommended by my friend. It didn't disappoint. I didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't feel very comfortable.

The appie was Tiger Shrimp, they were delicious but a little on the small side for a $13.00 order. My main was some on the best fried sea bass that I've ever had. Just the right amount of crumbs & the flavour was off the charts! Came with it's own garlic dipping sauce which just made it that much better.

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"Struggled really hard deciding what rating to give to Pai. First off, the service is quite excellent. The waitresses were very attentive, friendly, and kind - they greeted me with a smile, and despite the business of the place, they still treated my friend and I promptly and courteously. My friend and I both ordered the famous Khao Soi - he's had it multiple times, but it was my first. Unfortunately, I can't really have gluten (am fairly sensitive to gluten) so I asked if I could have the Khao Soi gluten free, with rice noodles. They readily accommodated.Both bowls arrived quite fast, given the many seated customers. My bowl, because it was gluten free, came without the fried egg noodles. I did notice, however, that I was given a very generous portion of noodles. Sadly, the rice noodles were extremely mushy and overcooked even upon arrival. As they slowly absorbed more and more liquid, the situation further deteriorated... By the end, they were unrecognizable clumps that had absorbed a lot of the broth. :(That said, they were fairly generous with portions. Mine came with two decent sized chicken drumsticks, while my friend's had a mound of chicken breast. There was also a variety of spices to be added - I would highly recommend adding them, as the pickles and hot sauce really amped the flavour!Something interesting to note is that my friend's Khao Soi tasted much stronger than mine. Mine was creamy, but his had a noticeable depth and richness. It was redder in colour, and there was more peanut flavour when compared to mine.I would advise against ordering the Khao Soi gluten free, even though they do provide an alternative. It simply doesn't compare to the original!",4.0,3.0,1560,2018-01-12,43.647866,-79.388642,Thai
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"Shockingly disappointing....I have had Pai in the back of my mind almost all of 2017 since they were voted best Thai restaurant on blogTO. My usual Thai is Khao San road but I was happy to snag a 9 PM reservation two months before some family visiting. However, that anticipation and satisfaction of delicious Thai street food was sadly crushed as the food was completely average. We got soup, Khao soi, kad pra gra, and pad Thai and all dishes were just okay. Flavor was lacking and I was surprised to hear that they couldn't make Khao soi spicy. I understand that it's a coconut base so it's hard to spice it up but it is still definitely possible, as other restaurants would prove.Ambiance of the restaurant is super nice and customer service was really good.",4.0,3.0,1560,2018-01-04,43.647866,-79.388642,Thai

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"Currently my favourite Thai spot in Toronto! I've been here numerous times and have never been disappointed. I've ordered most of the dishes on the menu so I'l only mention my highlights. Papaya salad - Huge serving compared to other places I've been to. The aroma and flavours are all reminiscent of SE Asia, with very strong and bold flavours. I got the salted crab variation and there were many pieces of crab included. I was expecting maybe 2-3 pieces! The pork rinds are also a welcome touch of texture. Sai Ua Platter (Northern Thai Sausage) - pork sausages, sticky rice and a Thai relish that reminded me of a Vietnamese noodle soup called bun rieu. Sausages had a balanced taste of all the spices and went well with the relish. Sticky rice acted as a good palette cleanser between the salty items. Gaeng Hunglay Ox Tail - an oxtail curry that was so tender. A perfect entree dish! Other items that are my usual favourites include the pad thai, khao soi, and pa gra prow, however, these are dishes you can get at the other Chef Nuit restaurants. Reservations are recommended (if you can get them) but they do allow walk-ins. I've never had to wait longer than 30 mins for a walk-in. Parking is hard to find during peak hours so I would recommend public transit if you can. Service is always friendly but can be a bit slow at times.",4.0,5.0,1560,2017-12-25,43.647866,-79.388642,Thai

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"You can't go wrong with a place that has 1500+ 5star reviews. We came here after a friend who is local here recommended it. We stopped by on a Friday afternoon for lunch and it was pretty crowded. You can order drinks and appetizers while you are waiting though which is great and made the wait painless.We ordered the eggrolls while we were waiting and to be honest I never thought I would write a review for an eggroll. This eggroll was definitely the best I have had so far; we liked it so much that we ordered a second plate of the appetizer. In addition, we got Penang curry and fried rice and both were great as well. Staff were super friendly and service was good.They don't do same day reservations though, so plan ahead because it does get super crowded.",4.0,5.0,1560,2017-12-19,43.647866,-79.388642,Thai
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"Good ol' yelp directed me here. The reviews are stellar and I was hungry, so it was an absolute no-brainer.There's honestly nothing quite like Thai food (really good and homemade, that is) to comfort you during the cold winter. I love how the menu isn't too elaborate nor too simple because it gives you options without being overwhelmed. We started off with the northern Thai sausage (pork belly) and it came with sticky rice (yum!). 3 of the 4 of us went with their chef nuit pad thai (it's always a safe option to go with). Their portions are generous and reasonably priced as a result ($14-15 per main dish I believe). I went with the khao soi, which consists of fresh egg noodles in a delectable coconut milk curry. Seriously, if you're ever in a mood for real good curry, this is the dish to go for because the noodles are drenched in it. I wish there was some naan to dip though.. (lol). We thoroughly enjoyed every dish. Service was fantastic, with periodic check ups here and there. Always there when we needed something too. Guys, the reviews don't lie.

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"I really really LOVE Thai food, and this place is THE place to be when you want authentic Thai food!First off, this place is always packed! ALWAYS! They use to take your cell phone number down and they would text you to notify you if your table is ready but just recently they've change that. You can't leave the premise anymore instead they will give you a buzzer which is so inconvenient. The service is kind and friendly, the place is huge which I've discovered only recently. There's more seating all the way to the right and back! It's pretty squished though. I had to stand up a couple of times to let people pass.The service is pretty fast and friendly, the food is A1! I highly recommend trying their squash Fritters to start, super crispy and I can't stop munching on it! And obviously sip on their infamous Thai Iced Tea. For the mains: you must try their PAD THAI! obviously. The flavours are just sooo tasty, their portion is super huge, I never finish it. Also please try their Pork Pad Gra Prow, and their oxtail! The flavours are indescribably Amazing! I suggest coming right when they open but if you don't mind waiting then there's a bar in the waiting area, and as far as I'm aware you can also grab food and apps while you wait!

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"I loved this place. Easily my new favourite Thai restaurant and I can see what all the rave reviews are about. We started with the spring rolls (best I've ever had), and then shared three main dishes: chicken pad Thai, pork pad gra prow and beef khao pad thamada. All of the dishes were so delicious that I was stuffed to the point I couldn't eat anymore (at which point I usually don't want to think about food for at least half a day), but this time I was craving more within the hour. The pad gra prow was definitely my favourite, the way the flavours all melded together was perfect. I had to try it mild because my friend doesn't do well with spicy good but I think it'd be even more delicious with a kick of spice in it. The other two dishes were good, but can't say they blew me out of the club water like this one.We also had a pitcher of sangria which was decent.",4.0,4.0,1560,2017-12-22,43.647866,-79.388642,Thai
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"Came here for the second time and really enjoyed my experience yet again. Once we got a number, we were directed to the bar to enjoy a drink or two while we wait inside the restaurant for them to buzz our number. During our wait, we ordered Tom Yum Caesar and Thai Mojito. Tom yum Caesar felt really strange at first, as it felt like cold tom yum soup with alcohol, but slowly became addicting.  When we finally got seated after about 20 to 30 minutes, we ordered:1- Miang Kung - various ingredients wrapped in betel leaf (really different than what I had tried before, it felt really refreshing...if you'd like a cold dish for appetizer, I'd recommend this dish. It's great that you can control your flavour to your liking as well2- Tom yum kung - large pot of tom yum soup with large shrimps, served with a bowl of white rice (it's a good portion to share between 2 people, a lot of soup)3- Pad gra prow - basil stir fried with our selection (tofu) ... also a tasty dish, but became really spicyOverall, I had really enjoyed the environment, except that it was unfortunate that the fire alarm went off and we were beside it, so a few tables around us including us rushed through dinner and left.

I had the green curry in a coconut, lots of depth and layers of flavours, I was by all means not disappointed at all. We also shared spring rolls and satay, both of which were very yummy. Pai reminds me of the flavours I've had in Thailand. Food is the most authentic thai food I've had outside of Thailand (albeit still being a little toned down).

I've taken more than 100 people in this restaurant including out-of-towners and recommended to families and friends. And every time they come back to thank me for introducing them to Pai.If you're ever going to order something here, that should be the Khao Soi. Rich and creamy and packed with flavour from the slew of aromatics combine with tender braised beef, this is my fave dish and the one I normally order here. If you want a unique cold beverage, you should try their Thai iced tea. This sweet, creamy beverage is very popular in Thailand and Pai's version is so refreshing and not so sweet. Another dish I enjoy ordering is the Thai Fried Rice. The subtle taste of fish sauce blends nicely with the other ingredients which makes it so delish!The restaurant ambiance is also homey and cosy and they have this one area where diners sit on cushions. Everyone from the hostess to the servers are very nice and friendly.I would have given 5 stars but noticed that the portions have gotten smaller.

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"I was lucky to try this place as my friend had made reservations months - yes you read that right, months! - early in advance for this place when I planned to visit Toronto. I didn't understand why the reso was needed for a Thursday night but when I got there and saw the crowds of people standing by the entry way, I was thankful for our reso. There are various types of seating at this restaurant including high tables with high chairs, regular tables, and also traditional sitting areas where you have to basically sit on the floor cross legged. If you are picky about how you sit, I would make sure to note this when making resos. The restaurant overall had a very bar/pub like feel and was extremely loud, which was not what I expected at all given the need for resos and the high reviews. The restaurant was quite big though, and it sounded like the wait for a table for two on a regular night was about 30min+. It's nice they have a waiting area as it was extremely cold outside!The menu had a good variety of items and everything sounded great. After reading through the Yelp reviews, we ordered the deep fried squash for our appetizer to share - good thing there was four of us because it was a huge stack of food. The best thing that made this dish was the sauce, and I would honestly have never known it was squash as it tasted more like yam or sweet potato. This was my favourite dish. We ordered the massaman curry as that is a regular fav of mine at most curry places, and the pad gra prow. We asked for both to be foreign spicy but they said that they serve the dishes as mild or medium and could give us extra spice on the side. Good thing we did as I actually found the medium quite spicy. I found the pad gra prow underwhelming visually, and the beef in my curry to be actually pretty tough. I expected the beef to be tender and melt in your mouth quality. However, the flavours for both dishes were strong and tastes authentic, and I was happy my curry did not taste watered down as a lot of Thai places do. After being quite satisfied with our meals, we wanted to order dessert. However the staff notified us that they were out of everything..??? Possible on a regular Thursday night? I was quite disappointed. Overall, service was good but nothing over the top friendly, and the food was great. I thought it was a bit expensive as the portions were average but the flavours were definitely great. Our food took a long long time to come out (at least 30min) and I'm not sure if this is the norm or they were particularly busy this night. I liked that the location was within walking distance from the train stations, and I did not drive so I'm not sure what the parking situation is like. Overall I would recommend this place if you like the energetic, bustling atmospheric and good Thai food. Not a good place to having convos with your friends for a long time though as I found it quite distracting and hard to speak loud enough to hear everyone at my table.",4.0,4.0,1560,2018-01-10,43.647866,-79.388642,Thai
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is one of the most popular Thai restaurants in Toronto and the restaurant won few awards from the NOW Magazine (2014 ~ 2016 Readers' Choice Runner-Up). Chef Nuit Regular also own three other sister restaurants (Sukho Thai, Kiin, and Sabai Sabai).Parking is not fun in downtorn Toronto, but I managed to find a lot about 4~5 blocks away. Our party got here at 6:45 PM and the hostess said the waiting time is approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour. I put my number down so that they can text me when our table is ready, but I started to get a bit anxious because I wasn't too sure whether I would actually get a text via data roaming (using US number in Canada) and my friend had delayed texts during this Toronto trip. Luckily one of my friends was able to utilize his unparalleled soft skill by talking to the hostess after we waiting about 30 minutes and somehow he was able to get our party a table immediately afterward.The menu selection reminds me a lot of Pok Pok (a very popular Thai restaurant in Portland). You will find mostly Norther Thai cuisine and no pad see ew is on the menu (I didn't even notice until one of my friends mentioned about it). I still somewhat questioned why one of my friends ordered Pad Thai when that's not even on one of Yelp's highlights, oh well.***Grabong (freshly shredded buttercup squash fritters lightly coated in red curry paste batter, deep fried and served with a sweet garlic tamarind dip with nuts - CAD $13): Squash fritters were lightly fried and they didn't even taste like squash (more like sweet potato). Oh man that sweet and spicy dipping sauce tasted extremely addicting. This is a must order dish.Pad Gra Prow with Crispy Pork (Moo Grob) (holy basil stir fried served on steamed jasmine rice and topped with a Thai style fried egg + nam prik nam pla sauce [fish sauce, garlic, chili & lime] - medium spicy, CAD $17.5): WARNING - If you don't like fish sauce, then you will NOT like this dish. Luckily I like fish sauce and this rice dish tasted a bit like a Thai version of Taiwanese minced pork rice with an egg. Medium spicy wasn't very spicy. It was a very delicious dish and I also recommend this dish too!Thai Iced Tea (CAD $5.50): Maybe I was pretty thirsty, but that was one good Thai tea. I probably finished the drink in less than 1 minutes.***EXCELLENT Thai food - good enough to compete against some of my favorite Thai restaurants in Los Angeles (e.g. Daisy Mint in Pasadena, CA).

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"Pai is my all time favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto. The only problem is that it's hard to get a reservation, even for weekdays. You have to do it weeks in advance. They do accept walk-ins, but prepare for a long wait. They text you when your table is ready, which is a nice bonus because then you can leave the restaurant and walk around or go to the bar next door and get a drink. Their pad thai is delicious. The best pad thai in Toronto. I also love their spring rolls, squash fritters and thai iced tea. The portion for the squash fritters is large so it's a good choice for sharing with the table.Their thai iced tea is the perfect combination of sweetness and creaminess.

Richmond Station,"Yum Yum and Yum (AND AND AND your wallet will not cry of despair). Richmond station is one of the most affordable and low key Toronto restaurants. They love to do everything in house, from cured meats to beer. They also make a mean Kombucha!We got charcuterie (3), ricotta on foccacia, the burger, the black cod and the olive oil and lemon dessert. Charcuterie was a hit, everything is house cured and they have a large variety rotating with the seasons. Burger was fingerlicking good, dripping in juices and exploding in flavors. My favorite of all was the dessert, its was so fun with its contrast of textures and flavors. Each bite was a surprise and a burst of flavor, from the creamy olive oil cream, to the torched smoky sugar crackling, from the tart and fresh lemon curd to the refreshing and fragrant honey jelly.",4.0,5.0,530,2018-01-28,43.651373,-79.379285,Canadian (New)
Richmond Station,"This has been on my ""must try"" list for quite some time - strong Yelp reviews along with hotel conceirge recommendations.  Went on a quiet Monday night and it did not disappoint.Food:Starter - Smoked Trout. $13. Daily special with smoked trout on a bed of cream sauce and winter veggies.  The sauce is light as foam and the trout was done first nations jerky-style.  Very yummy! This was my favorite dish of the evening. Main - Rabbit Two Ways. $27. Tender rabbit meat prepared in 2 styles.  Think it was fried and baked (Wished I took better notes...). Regardless, they were delicious and juicy. This was a great winter dish and matched well with an Argentinian Malbec.Dessert - Hawker Centre. $11. A sorbet flavoured with a Singapore flair - scent of Pandan leaves along with sesame brittle and a hint of fish sauce. This was rather creative but may not suit the unadventurous.  I liked.Service - Typical of a restaurant of this caliber.  Dress code is casual (i.e., jeans) but some chose to glamour up. Not pretentious. Overall - Glad to find a quality and ""non-touristy"" dining experience in the heart of downtown. This is one fine restaurant and deserving of a 4.5 Star rating.  I will definitely return.",4.0,4.0,530,2018-01-29,43.651373,-79.379285,Canadian (New)

Richmond Station,"I have been here for weekday lunch (they have a 2 course prix fixe special), dinner, and most recently, for Saturday slow roast. Flavour and quality are consistently excellent, the service is always warm and friendly, and the space is great. Bonus points for being a reliable option in an area that is dominated by overpriced touristy places. This is not a place to go for #meatlessmondays... The meat dishes are where they shine and they source meat from small, local farmers and only buy whole animals to cut down on waste. The charcuterie boards and the burger are always a hit and the slow roast Saturday lunch is fantastic. The dish changes every week -- when I went it was $22 for roasted chicken on cauliflower puree with potatoes and vegetables on the side. A hearty and delicious lunch! If you add dessert it is only $6 (instead of the regular price of $11). Be warned, the slow roast is available til 4pm or when it sells out. Try to come early. When I went, they ran out around 1:30pm. If you want something lighter, they do have some soups and a quinoa salad, as well as a daily fish dish. There's a small room at the back that can accommodate private groups and they can do a chef's menu for your group. I haven't tried that yet. They have a decent wine list and some fun cocktails on offer. If you sit at the back, you can watch the kitchen action, or if you're here for a business lunch there are tables and bar seating in the brighter front area.

Richmond Station,"Having been to Richmond Station twice, I can comfortably say this is one of my favourite restaurants in the dt core.Server is extremely knowledgeable about the dishes.DUCK LIVER PATE - The pate toasts are blissful bites. Rich, smooth and creamy with mild gamey notes on a piece of toasted brioche. The mini candied fruit taste like strawberry jelly and adds a beautiful sweetness to break the richness.POLENTA FRIES - I didn't care too much for this dish. Polenta was fried very crispy and the polenta is smooth inside. The spicy marinara was limited and didn't offer much of a kick. I feel it was too ""boring"" when shared only between 2 people, we each got at least 3-4 bulky fries and it felt too much.STN BURGER - This was GOOOOOD. Beef was cooked to a perfect mid rare. Patty was juicy with all the right things going for it: richness from the cheese, sweetness from the beet chutney and a fluffy milk bun to hold it all. Maybe not the best burger I've ever had, but definitely memorable. Fries were crisp and well seasoned too but the garlic aioli was bland.DAILY SPECIAL MARINATED STEAK - Steak was very tender and cook was better than most steak houses. Garnishes all taste delicious and gave it good balance: mild heat from chipotle black beans, beautiful kale florets and a smooth lime crema. LONDON FOG DESSERT - This was one of those abstract desserts that are deconstructed. All the components are absolutely delicious...I have trouble noting what each was but it was one of the highlights of my night.Overall, I am very happy with the quality of food at Richmond Station. What makes it even better is the prices. Dishes run small but the friendly prices let you order more. We paid prices comparable to a Moxies/Milestones, but you get contemporary food that was prepared with creativity and finesse.",4.0,4.0,530,2017-11-26,43.651373,-79.379285,Canadian (New)
Richmond Station,"The chef's menu was the way to go! The chef's curated menu left nothing to be desired except more room in our stomachs to keep on eating. Between 7 people we had a mostly family style menu with the following dishes: Scallion Polenta Fries, Liver Mousse, Roasted Carrot Salad, Trout Salad, Brassica Caesar, Fish Soup, Beef Shank with mushroom gravy, London Fog & Stn. Snowman for dessert. The desserts were out of this world, both in taste & curation! The staff was extremely accommodating, answered all my questions on how the chef's menu worked, listened to me rattle off 5 things I would prefer not to eat & had great attention to detail to ensure no one ate something against dietary restrictions.The best part of the meal was the ability to sit back and relax between dishes with ample time to digest the previous course before moving on.

Like any $16 cocktail, the drinks were strong, and tasty and we got to watch the bartender make them. Service was super friendly, and brought us homemade sour dough slices that that days soybean oil and balsamic mix. We both ordered burgers, with toppings removed or on the side, and they were very accommodating and remembered to actually put it all on the side. The burger seems small at a first glance, but it is a thick patty cooked to a perfect medium rare. The beet relish compliments it perfectly, and the but is soft and warm. The fries are nice and crispy too!For dessert was ordered the peach mousse? It was cool conceptually, but did not deliver on the taste front. A fun experiment in gastronomy, but not meant to be eaten...just admired and marvelled for the ""fun with food"" aspect. It's definitely in the runner for (if not the actual) best burger in the city, but the price tag definitely isn't the best in the city.",4.0,4.0,530,2017-09-25,43.651373,-79.379285,Canadian (New)

Richmond Station,"Today is my third time to Richmond Station. It's a cute restaurant with amazing food! The specials changes daily and the menu changes weekly which is great so that you can come back and have other dishes.Location:  This restaurant is a bit hard to find and the sign is not visible.  It's located at the downtown core King and Richmond. Very convenient and easily accessible via walking or subway.Service:  Amazing service! The waitress was very informative when asked about the items on the menu.  All the wait staff tried all the food on the menu which I think is great so that they can tell you if the dish is good. Great food and dessert recommendations by the waitress.Food:  We started the meal with quinoa salad which was part of the prix-fixe menu on the daily specials. It was delicious!  We also ordered a chucutterie board with 3 cured meat and 3 cheeses. My favourite was a sausage and the applewood cheese. Then my aunt had the roast beef sandwich which was part of the prix fixe menu. The sandwich came with apple and potato salad.  It was delicious. The roast beef sandwich had sirracha sauce which gave it a nice kick.  I ordered the pork loin 2 ways. One way was roasted pork loin and the second way was ground pork loin wrapped in a paste shaped like a tart with a corn, salsa and mole sauce.  For dessert we shared the blueberry, white chocolate hazelnut crumble. Delicious!Overall amazing dining experience. Book reservations well in advance since this place tends to fill up and it's pretty small.",4.0,5.0,530,2017-09-12,43.651373,-79.379285,Canadian (New)
Richmond Station,"This is the second time for myself and my partner at this restaurant and we left the first time with fond memories and happy bellies. We were celebrating our anniversary and had tried to get a reservation in open table several weeks in advance. I would recommend calling in to give yourself a better number of seating time options. I also asked the restaurant to hold off on any champagne due to the fact that it would be wasted on me. The service this time was a bit lacking in that we were waiting on our waiter to take our order for mains. We started the meal off by getting a Kombucha and Spiced pear drink. We had the charcuterie board (3 options), and the trout crudo. Both appetizer were quite good with the crudo being slightly salty if you eat it in bites, but stuffing the whole thing in your mouth eats better. When the server came to take our order for mains, he recommended the duck and they mushroom agnolotti. The agnolotti was as advertised, absolutely delicious, creamy, umami, and with the complexity as depth of flavour as you ate. If you're a light eater I suggest sharing, especially if you had apps. The duck was prepared two ways and I prefer the whole leg kept the way it was. The crispy skin taste really highlights the dish. The croquette styled duck fritter was good but didn't have the same satisfaction for me as I ate it. The deserts were also a highlight. I got the Hawker Centre and my partner got the St. Snowman. The snowman dessert was cute and refreshing. I found the hawker centre to be quite interesting a surprise in both texture and flavour. The fish sauce listed on the menu intrigued me to get it. Despite the taste not really coming through (which I believe is what they were going for) the desert was well balanced and delicious.",4.0,4.0,530,2017-12-16,43.651373,-79.379285,Canadian (New)

Richmond Station,"Our experience here was positive in every way. Initially we attempted to make a reservation online, only to be disappointed with a very personal message from the hostess informing us that they were booked, but that they kept some high top tables available for walk-ins. Taking a chance, we walked in and were honoured to be seated at the chef's table, taking an opening before a larger party was scheduled to arrive. The food was absolutely excellent; the service was attentive and personable; the entertainment watching the choreography of the chef and servers from our seats was engaging; the pace was excellent, at no point rushed; the accommodations offered for our youngest member of the party (a six-year-old) demonstrates a true family- oriented approach. I'm so pleased we took a chance to walk in. We will return with concrete reservations, hopefully for the chef's table again.",4.0,5.0,530,2018-01-10,43.651373,-79.379285,Canadian (New)
Richmond Station,"Went their for my husband's birthday dinner. We we got there we got a table near their bar and it was very loud. So we requested our server to give us another table if possible and she did fulfill our request. We got a table near the kitchen and this area is more comfortable for the seating.We ordered started with Polenta fries and ordered Stn. Burger, Heritage Pork for the mains. Polenta fries were the best I've ever had. Stn Burger is the real deal. The beef patty was cooked to perfection and was amazingly flavourful and juicy for that matter even the bun was too goooood. The burger was too good that I forgot to eat fries and I am telling you I am a huge fries fan. My husband ordered Heritage Pork and that was delicious too. Finally we decided to have London Fog and it was to die for!! I would give up anything to have it again and again.

Since there was only 2 of us, we only ordered a few from their staple menu, baked oysters, takoyaki, karaage, bibimbap with a pint of beer each.While the food came out mostly delicious, the portions have changed - especially apparent in the size of oysters, like one was significantly smaller than the other. The takoyaki wasn't crispy at all on the outside, the chicken sizes weren't similar so a few pieces came out a little pink on the inside. The server was a bit hard to flag down, but the few times she came to our table, was friendly and helpful.

KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL,"Came here for a company celebration and absolutely loved it! It's so authentically Japanese, and the service and food were both on point. The waiters and waitresses were super friendly, and the food was very flavourful, albeit often greasy. But what else do you expect from an izakaya?We started off with some vegetable appetizer, made of blanched choy sum topped with sweet black sesame sauce. Though I did enjoy this dish, I felt that the sesame could be slightly less sweet. It was a little overpowering!Cheese baked oysters were then served. The oysters were chopped into tiny pieces, mixed with potatoes and mushrooms, and combined in a cheesy buttery brie like mixture. Quite heavy, but so sinfully tasty.Afterwards, we were given a variety of meets. Short ribs arrived first, grilled to a perfect char. The karaage followed soon afterwards, but I regret to say that I was unable to eat a single piece. My colleagues, however, went for thirds and fourths, and praised the dish highly.A salad topped with mayo and some ginger based dressing came, accompanied by some seared salmon and tuna on the surface. Delicious! I wouldn't have minded it without the mayo, but it was still a refreshing palette cleanser from the heartier dishes.We then moved to the fish dishes. A seared salmon with mayo and some ponzu sauce arrived (we were each limited to two pieces, but people were so stuffed by this point that I was able to have three). Afterwards, fatty chunks of black cod were served. The cod literally melted in my mouth, and the slightly sweet glaze was different but tasty. The crispy skin was the best! I feel that a slightly tangier glaze of citrus would have better complemented the fish, but it was still delicious nonetheless.We then ended with a bibimbap dish, which was essentially rice with a lot of oil, cheese, seaweed, and mushrooms. The mushrooms were heavenly! Meaty and chunky, and fully absorbing all the flavour.We also ordered many drinks (bamboo sake, red and white wine, and beer), and since we're at an izakaya, we obviously had to get sake bombs. The staff were always very enthusiastic and attentive. Loved this place, and will definitely return! It's a little loud, but very lively. Perfect for birthday celebrations - in fact, we stumbled upon a table celebrating a birthday and it seemed very nice. :)",4.0,4.0,1209,2017-11-24,43.660524,-79.378927,"Japanese , Pubs"

KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL,"WHAT TO TRY?!Their sake bombs. It's a popular drink here! For $5 you get a shot of sake in a cup of beer. But not only that, you get to experience the fun part of having the whole restaurant get all revved up as you take this same bomb challenge. A waiter will yell sake and you yell bomb. After three instances of shouting back and forth, you rumble the table to have the sake shot drop into your beer before downing it in one go. Quite fun!Their tapas style dishes are great too. I recommend the sashimi dishes here and the takoyaki too. You can see in my pictures what I had and I loved all the dishes I ordered! The ambiance in this restaurant has always been loud and lively so if you're not up for that, this restaurant may not be the best choice for you. Many come here for a birthday celebration or celebrating something because the bigger your group, the more it is when you do a sake bomb. The only thing I want to warn you is about the pace of the service. Because they are so busy, sometimes it will take a bit longer for them to get the food to you or they simply forgot about your beer order. So be patient and be prepared to follow up with a waiter on your order!!LAST TIP?!The bill can quickly add up because you want to try everything but a good rule of thumb is to order two dishes per person to start and then order more as you go along your meal!

There were music/songs playing and I felt that the volume was kind of loud. I ordered the Miso ramen + Gyu Carpaccio. My friends ordered the regular size Karaage Don, Gomaae, Tako Wasabi and Donburi with salmon sashimi. I am a huge ramen lover, but honestly, I didn't appreciate the Miso ramen that I ordered. I'd rather have a ramen at near-by Kinton, Sansotei or Santouka. I usually finish most of the soup whenever I have ramen, but this time I left it half way. As for the appetizers, I loved it. Guy Carpaccio was yummy, except that it doesn't look like the picture that has been posted on Yelp by the restaurant. I also think that it is a bit overpriced ($7.50) for 5 thin slices of beef. Tako Wasabi was good too, we could taste the octopus, and there was lots of wasabi. To be enjoyed little by little. Donburis came with a miso soup and a side salad. Karaage Don came with pieces of fried chicken and the bowl was filled completely. My friend who had the salmon one was still kind of hungry after the meal.

KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL,"I feel like this one is a bit tough for me to review, because I wasn't entirely sure what to expect and it took some adjusting. Kinka describes itself as a ""Japanese Pub"" and that it will ""transport you to Japan"". It is definitely unlike any Japanese restaurant I have ever been to and is unique in many ways. My boyfriend and I decided to order the Set Menu so we could try a variety of things we wouldn't normally order. It requires that everyone at the table also order the set menu and it is 36$/person. Sashimi Salad- Delicious and light Salmon Tataki- Fantastic! Karrage- Delicious, moist chicken and the garlic mayo is to die for! Kinoko Bibimbap- My boyfriends favourite of the night. (I personally don't like seaweed sauce, so I didn't eat any of it). Kaki Mayo- This was ok, but I prefer raw oysters so it wasn't my favourite. Gindara- Very, very good cod. Really enjoyed the grilled miso top, very different. Lots of small bones to watch out for though.Black Sesame Ice Cream- Different but a nice change. There are a couple other items I have excluded because I don't really remember them, and I got so full that I didn't try everything.The service was fantastic - our server was very attentive and helpful when navigating the menu. Ambience: It is SO LOUD. The servers are constantly yelling and hollering and rumbling on tables, and I admit it was not for me at first. Especially because we were by one of the server areas where they are calculating bills, so they would be literally right next to our ears sometimes. To be honest, it might still not be for me. You have to go when you are feeling in the party mood; and are able to integrate yourself into the rambunctiousness. With that being said, when everyone started yelling and hollering and waving good-bye as we left, I did start to feel as if it were one big happy family--- annnnd it kinda warmed my heart. Verdict: I would come back to try the Udon noodle dishes and more sashimi. I think that I would be a little more satisfied with dishes that are more typical of me to order. However, I don't regret venturing out of my comfort zone a bit and would definitely suggest to give this place a try!",4.0,3.0,1209,2017-12-05,43.660524,-79.378927,"Japanese , Pubs"

KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL,"@KinkaIzakayaTO #YELPTO #KINKAIZAKAYATO #FOODIE #SALMON #TORONTOFOODIESHeavy rains couldn't dampen our date night - I had a special foodgasm (and other gasms) planned. Once again, I had myself picked up; and now that we had already familiarized ourselves with each other, we touched each other a lot more. What started with a soft kiss, went on with him holding my hand while driving, as I directed him to the parking lot near Kinka. During the red lights, he either lost himself in my eyes or in my mouth - and lo and behold, we ended up missing our turns a few times. The Church street location is really close to a $5 underground parking on Gerrard (right across from the Ryerson theatre school) - super convenient. We parked, got out of the car and I wondered aloud how we would make it through to the restaurant in the rain. He pulled me close and caught my breath in his mouth, lilting, teasing till he whispered that he had a solution; with that and a flick of his fob, he opened up his car trunk to a few large umbrellas and other goodies - usually gifts for clients, he said. How do you tell a man that you're dating that you'd really like one of those for yourself? I didn't and it's one of my biggest regrets. We walked out into the streets, under the mega large umbrella he held with one strong arm, his other one around me. I blushed inwards; I loved how tiny I was by his side and the fact that his fingers were moving down my back embarrassed me a teeny bit. He turned towards me a few times during our walk, to pull me in for little kisses. We got to Kinka safe and un-drenched, but we had missed our reservation timing and the only seats they had available were at the bar. Also, their all season heated patio was closed as it is not leak proof. Who knew! I cringed, knowing that we wouldn't have a private spot to ourselves but we went along with it and I think it made for the BEST DATE SPOT. We sat beside each other, very very close - and it was just another excuse to have our hands on each other. The chemistry was insane, his touch sent little shivers through my body. The date was over an hour so my body was receiving tiny pleasurable shocks through the evening. I wonder if he felt the same way. He was pleased with my pick - and he was overall impressed with the quality of service and food. As for me, I've always loved this place! I ordered a sake mojito and he ordered a bottle of Japanese beer. We bent over the menu and made food decisions over stolen looks and kisses - - salmon natto yukke that I've raved about enough number of times and he loved it too- beef carpaccio was yum- deep fried brie cheese which is usually good but was a bit of a disappointment this time- baked oyster with spinach and this totally stole the show (orgasmic) - kinoko bibimbap was alright- more.I'd like to blame it on the oysters that night, but maybe it was just us; perhaps it was the intimacy of the bar where you're forced to create closeness so that it doesn't feel too communal. While we sat and ate, the servers performed a rap battle and songs and it was super fun. We danced on our bar stools together and cheered them on. He took a video of the performance and us, and I felt more attracted to him than I ever had (if that was even possible). It came to a point where he just could not even keep his hands away from me for a second, that's when we decided to pay and leave. I took care of the bill this time and he was super sheepish about it. I insisted - and it was truly a pleasure to take him out. BEST $100+ ever spent. We speed walked to his car and he was happy to pay for parking. The wait of the drive to his place was almost painful after such a great night, for the both of us.

The chicken is plentiful and tasty. The seasoned spicy had just enough batter that did not overbear the taste of the chicken. While I was a little skeptical of the Gold Cheese, it made for a good complement to the season spicy. We had enough to take home for another meal.

Mymy Chicken,"I am no expert on Korean Fried Chicken but I have had a couple of memorable samples of it in New York and LA. Clearly I have some catching up to do here in Toronto because it seems to be a thing. And Mymy Chicken appears to be a great place to start. The atmosphere is really quite nice, the tables not crowded, and even though it was bustling, the noise level was energetic (but not annoying). We ordered the combo half Golden (cheese) and half Seasoned Spicy (the ""Best"" combo according to the menu) plus a beer and a bottle of Soju to split. Even though the place was full, the order came right away. The service was friendly and efficient. Two things fried chicken need to be are 1) hot and 2) juicy. Big marks on both counts for Mymy. The chicken with finely grated cheese and cheese powder was a curious flavour. The cheese powder has the kind of taste usually reserved for Doritos or Au Gratin potato chips. Together with fried chicken, this is a taste profile that is unusual but oddly addictive. The Seasoned Spicy Chicken was covered in a sweet sticky sauce that displayed hints of cinnamon. It wasn't what I would normally gravitate towards (I like a drier actually spicy type) but again it was also oddly addictive. The fried chicken underneath was very good. At $29 for the combo the amount of chicken we got was generous, and we did manage to control ourselves and walked out with leftovers.Overall even if the flavors were unfamiliar I am giving this place a solid 4 because I think what they do, they do really well. We will be back to try some of the other styles, but in the meantime we have quite a few other places to check out as we do a shallow dive into Toronto's Asian fried chicken scene.",3.0,4.0,19,2018-01-26,43.666114,-79.407229,"Korean , Chicken Shop"

We asked for water when the food came.The topokki was amoungst the most plain/simple looking I've had but it was satisfying to taste. Yummy! Loved the touch of fresh green onions instead of seaweed or sesame seeds. I found the price of $11 to be a little high for an average portion of the simple appetizer. They had many tempting add ons such as cheese, extra rice cakes, dumplings and more but it was $2.50 each!!! I don't think this could even be completely filling as a meal despite costing as much as one. Alternatively, the spicy chicken had a unique  flavour. It reminded me of a warm Christmas drink and it was addicting to eat. The chicken wasn't crispy since it was covered in a thick and sticky sauce. Despite being labelled as spicy, it was way too mild. The topokki was much more satisfyingly spicy. My friend and I had decided that the golden cheese chicken was the better fried chicken between the two even though we love spicy KFC!! Weve tried a lot of different places and eat it quite frequently. From other reviews, I was expecting the chicken to be a bit dry but I didn't experience that problem even with our boneless chicken. I'm not sure if it was on the menu, but boneless is $2 more JSYK. The cheese powder was interesting but I liked the  shredded cheese more. Honestly, I think the only separating feature between the golden cheese fried chicken and regular fried chicken topped with cheese is the cheese powder. Overall, everything paired well but I probably would not come again or crave anything from here. Nothing was BAD but nothing was amazing either. I'd rather just try something new next time I'm in the area but that's just me.",3.0,3.0,19,2018-01-24,43.666114,-79.407229,"Korean , Chicken Shop"
Mymy Chicken,"Came in right when they opened at 4 PM, so we got their only booth seats.

Side dishes were offered consisting of radishes and sliced cabbage. Refills available.Chicken was prepared within 20 minutes.The meat in general was pretty dry, but the skin was nice and crisp and not greasy at all. I enjoyed the original the most because of this; the other saucy ones weren't as interesting because the meat was dry, and the sauces weren't that great.Apparently, one of the pieces was juicy, but I didn't get to taste that one.

On my second visit, 3 nights later, we ordered the 3 flavours combo: gold cheese, honey & garlic, seasoned spicy. The flavours are nicely balanced, however the chicken comes out slightly dry - which is a bit disappointing.

The ""golden cheese"" tasted more sweet than savoury & it reminded me of the cheese topping on a Filipino pastry called ensaymada which is a sweet bread with butter, sugar and cheese on top.

Mymy Chicken,"Some friends and I had the chance to try out this location and I'd say this one was a lot better than the uptown location on Yonge. The waitress was very accommodating and she seemed like she knew the menu fairly well, unlike my recent take out order. I really like that the menu had nut allergy labelled for their chicken dishes and she was nice enough to tell us that certain sauces we got as dip contained nuts. There were a few new fried chicken that wasn't on the uptown menu and we had the pleasure to trying them out. These included the traditional and the gold cheese with cream sauce. Both were interesting (the traditional was a bit dry but the outer layer was crispier than the original and the cream sauce had an awkward sourness to it that I didn't like) but I'd rather just go with the original and gold cheese. We did a three way combo so out chicken dishes came out in smaller proportions but was a decent size for the 7 of us. Maybe a few of my male friends could eat more so I'd still order 3 separate chicken plates for those wanting more out of it. Overall, it's not somewhere I'd return just for fried chicken since there are many other places around but it wasn't a bad experience.",3.0,4.0,19,2017-11-18,43.666114,-79.407229,"Korean , Chicken Shop"

The servers were responsive and prompt. The food came in late (25+ minutes after ordering) even though it was half empty inside. I still enjoyed the overall experience.The only thing I didn't like about the restaurant was that the washroom had an open sink shared by everyone.

The Jerk Chicken is so addictive - it's smoky, moist, sweet and spicy. It's not the normal jerk chicken leg you find in other restaurants. The dish comes with bite sized jerk chicken, rice and peas, salad and a delicious coleslaw.  The oxtail is also fall of the bone tenderness - a satisfying stew perfect for a chilly day.  They also give you homemade hot sauce which is amazingly good and spicy.And the best part, the prices are so reasonable.

Andrea helped me figure it out and then sat us down to eat! There were so many choices on the menu and I wanted them all. They had regular chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles with berries (Itanni), and even jerk chicken and waffles. They had lots of breakfast, my favorite and lots of choices. I wanted to try the jerk chicken but I thought it might've been too spicy for my mom. So instead we got the Itanni which was fried chicken, waffles with maple triple berries sauce. It was sooooo good! It was a perfect size to share since I also ordered a breakfast plate. My breakfast plate had egg whites, bacon, potatoes, and butter bread. She told me the butter bread is just like white bread... But they must have buttered it to perfection because I could've eaten a pile of it. Great cheat meal! Everything thing I tasted was delicious. I also thought it was cute that they had old-school hip-hop playing in the background. Maybe 90's R&B. What else can you asked for when you have great customer service, bomb food and good prices?!

Under The Table Restaurant,"My two friends and I were in Toronto for a quick weekend getaway and were looking for a quality meal without a hefty price tag. I yelped different types of food in the area and came across this little piece of heaven! We arrived by UBER and were a bit taken aback ( I must admit, I didn't look at very many pictures) as we didn't expect it to be a ""hole in the wall"", type of restaurant. We entered and were promptly greeted with a smile and given a table to sit at. Shortly after sitting down we were entertained by a local man who frequents the establishment. He was a lively character bursting with energy and humor. We checked out the menu and I was slightly disappointed that I didn't see any of the dishes that I associate with Jamaican food - curry chicken/goat and/or pepper steak. Not to worry though, a fan favorite, oxtails, were on the menu. Every time that I've had oxtails I had more fat than meat, so I was a bit skeptical ordering them, but I am so glad that I did! They were absolutely delicious and the meat came right off of the bone and with very little fat attached. The accompanying salad and rice and peas all made for a very tasty meal at an unbeatable price. My friends and I were there for a limited time and opted to take a few rounds of shots (shots, shots, shot, shots...everybody, lol). The woman who primarily helped us was awesome. She made sure that we weren't going to be driving and even dedicated a song to us, Keri Hilson's ""Pretty Girl Rock"". We had a wonderful evening at ""Under the Table"" and an incredible meal.

Beach Hill Smokehouse,"I stopped by the other day to look at the menu and I was impressed.So we ordered some barbecue to pick up and take home.It was so tender and juicy.  Finally some real Texas barbecue in the city and bonus points for being right around the corner from my house.The owner was very nice.  I like the fact that it's a family run place.Sorry Hogtown Smoke, but this is my new go to place",5.0,5.0,9,2018-01-17,43.684106,-79.300406,Barbeque
Beach Hill Smokehouse,"What a great time. Excellent BBQ! My favourite was the brisket but also enjoyed the ribs, chicken and turkey. Beans were tasty with a good touch of spice and cilantro. Pretty fair Cole slaw. Plain white bread to mop things up, nothing special there. Order in the back at counter where you can see your meat cut and weighed, then grab a picnic table.Beer coming in about a month. For now just pop and water. Extra BBQ sauce in large squeeze bottles and some peppers, onions and pickles as well.Exuberant friendly service from the owners sets a feel good atmosphere.They were sold out  of the sausage and I got the last chicken at 6pm!Didn't try the banana pudding.

Beach Hill Smokehouse,"Went today on their Opening Day. Been waiting patiently for the open since hearing about them moving in to the neighbourhood. I had plenty of time to build up the expectations in my head. I have the say they surpassed any and all expectations and hopes I had. First the people running this restaurant have a friendliness and passion that is infectious.  Upon entering I was greeted so warmly by the entire staff, it was amazing. The interior of the restaurant looks very nice and comfortable for people dining in. Myself, I was getting the BBQ to go.  I ordered a bunch of stuff off the menu to get a good gauge of their work. We ordered the Brisket, Ribs, chicken and sausage as well as the Mac n Cheese, baked beans and coleslaw for sides. All the meats where smoked to perfection!  The Brisket was practically a religious experience. All the sides were delicious with me favourites being the baked beans and the coleslaw which had I nice touch of heat to it. This place deserves to be a huge success and if the opening day was any indication this restaurant is going to be an incredible hit and a welcome edition to the east end. Welcome Beach Hill BBQ. You made a huge fan of me tonight.",5.0,5.0,9,2018-01-02,43.684106,-79.300406,Barbeque
Beach Hill Smokehouse,"First time try at this new BBQ smokehouse in the Beach. And from the start you know you are going to be having a good meal. The smell of BBQ is the first thing that greets you as soon as you enter and that is such a wonderful thing. The menu is straight forward. So I gave the Brisket, sausages and ribs a try. The ribs are smoked so long that you can see how deep the flavor has gone in the meat and the Brisket is to die for. So tender and flavorful and the rub on the outside just gives it that delightful bit of peppercorns. Oh so good. The side of baked beans was very tasty. The cook and manager and staff are an absolute delight, you feel that southern hospitality.All in all I highly recommend you give this place a try.",5.0,4.0,9,2018-01-06,43.684106,-79.300406,Barbeque

Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos,"Let's just start off by saying I am a San Diego, California native. Somehow I found myself living in the country side of north New York. I'm guessing not many people would think New York even has a countryside? Anyhow, here in the north country. We literally have NO REAL FOOD. Now you know with the border so close, I had to make a trip out to Toronto! And I literally came out here JUST for food. That's how real the cravings are. THIS PLACE RIGHT HERE. Is THEEE BEST spot for authentic, street tacos or tj tacos (what we call It in San Diego lol) I have been away from home and real mexican food. Not that Tex Mex stuff, for months. I mean like close to a year. How can anyone survive without having food like this?! On to the food, we had to save some room you know. Since our whole trip to Toronto was based around food lol. My husband and I ordered three tacos to share. Knowing I could've had like three to myself. We ordered a fish and 2 cabeza tacos because I didn't want to share lol.These tacos are huge. If you don't know what cabeza is, who cares. Order It anyways, because it's Bomb af lol. No but really, cabeza is the meat from the head, cheek. Face? you know, It sounds weird but it's delicious. The meat was super soft and tender, sounds so cliche but It literally MELTS in your mouth. They also had homemade salsas which paired perfectly, choose your heat! I loved them all, the hottest one was actually really spicy. But I'm into that kind of thing. On to the fish taco, this came out so hot and fresh. It stayed crispy and flakey while I was finishing up my cabeza taco! I wish I was back there, eating one right now. If you've never had a fish taco, what is your life?? It had the usual cabbage slaw, nice white sauce, fresh tomato onion pico. The flavors are so well balanced and dance in your mouth giving you a taste of everything. Basically, don't give It a second thought. Go for It, try something new. You won't regret It!",4.0,5.0,957,2018-01-26,43.654341,-79.40048,Mexican
Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos,"Damn good. As everyone says, there's extremely limited seating and it's busy, even on a cold, rainy day. Regardless, the wait was short and all the employees were sweet! The atmosphere was cheerful and alive. Ordered the Baja fish taco, carnitas and chicken. Didn't get a chance to take a picture bc I was so busy scarfing it down. The Baja fish was by far the best (and messiest-I ended up eating it w a fork. Help yourself to the wet naps they've set out for sure!), but they were all taaaasty. I guess $6 is a lot for one taco, but they are REALLY stuffed, which is what I was before I had even finished two. I'll be back for sure.",4.0,4.0,957,2018-01-27,43.654341,-79.40048,Mexican
Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos,"Tacos are probably one of my favorite eats. I love the flavors & I love the messiness. I'm always in search of a good taco place and kept hearing amazing things about seven lives in Kensington Market. I had my cousins coming in from out of town and decided to check it out. This is only getting 1 star because I have to give it a star. I will never step foot in here again. I'm not sure if it was my experience or this is how they operate and people have not had good tacos. I walked in to a very very small shop. There was one picnic bench and some window seating. My cousins grabbed the bench and I waited in line. The line moved fairly quickly and finally it was my turn. I ordered Guac and Chips, and everyone got 3 types of tacos. Chicken, Beef and Pork. I've heard the fish tacos are what has made them famous but I'm allergic to fish. The chips are guac were good. Crispy Chips and Garlicky Guac won my heart. Moved on to the tacos. Every single taco had crazy amounts of fat. The Chicken had gummy bits, and the pork and beef all had HUGE chunks of fat in them. I couldn't eat it, and neither could my cousins. Also a side note; the tortilla kept falling apart with every bite, it was such a disaster. NEVER COME HERE. I would go to Playa Cabana which has amazing pulled pork tacos with ZERO FAT.

Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos,Best tacos in Toronto!! It's a must try if you're a fan of mexican food.1 taco is ~$6 but you get a lot of meat. It's stuffed with ingredients and they dont cheap out. I loved the one with pineapples and the first one on the menu (one with cheese).The place is tiny and there is only 1 table and 1 wall table thing.

Two tacos were the perfect amount. The wait wasn't too long considering there was a line inside the store. The inside is really small, so expect to eat and then leave right away or take them to go. They really do stuff the tacos but there's enough of the shell to keep all of it together.

Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos,"Not the typical Mexican taco joint: Seven Lives serves up tacos with unique fillings like octopus, beef cheek and corn smut. Don't knock it if you haven't tried it, being adventures will bring you delicious rewards.WE SHARED:Camarones A La Diablo - generous amount of bouncy, meaty shrimp swimming in a medium spicy sauce and crema: a tasty start.Cuitlacoche (corn smut, black beans and cheese) - The flavor was over powering. I enjoyed it more scooping it up in small amounts with the chips. Hubby said it would taste better paired with meat. We paired it with the beef cheek and head meat and scooped it up with the chips: hubby was right, YUM!Cabeza (beef cheek, head meat, grilled onions, guac and cilantro) - The meat was tender with pieces of fat scattered about: pretty good.Pulpo (grilled octopus with celery) - Tender with a slight chew to it, some bits had char. The celery threw off the taste so I picked it all out. Would have tasted better with some salsa but they didn't have any take out containers for them.Gobernador (grilled marlin, shrimp and cheese) - seafood was good, it had a sweet and smoky sauce.Pricey street tacos (hey, I'm from California) but at least they're stuffed to the point where you'll probably need a fork to scoop up the filling that spills out of the ends.They have one nice wooden table with benches by the window that can seat 4-6 people and also skinny bar tables along the walls where you can stand and eat. The person taking the orders was so disinterested and looked liked she didn't want to be there.

Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos,"Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos is located in Kensington Market (mini outdoor district with food and vintage shops) and specializes in Southern California style Mexican food. Sometimes I even question why I flew all the way to Toronto to try something I can get back home, but hey I can never get sick of eating tacos and this shop is one of the more popular food options in Kensington Market.This is a really small taco shop with few long pub tables. The chances are you will have to stand while you are eating your tacos. Each taco isn't exactly cheap - CAD $6 PLUS tax (about USD $4.75) and there are 9 different taco options to choose from. Their tiny salsa bar is right next to the cashier counter and salsas weren't exactly memorable.***Baja Fish (fried haddock; CAD $6) and Gobernador (smoked marlin, shrimp & cheese; CAD $6): Two tacos were enough to fill me up. Each taco came with double layered corn tortilla. Baja Fish was definitely better than Gobernador and I can see why Baja Fish is on Yelp's review highlights. Not the best Baja fish taco, but it was lightly battered and tasted pretty good. On the other hand, I wasn't too impressed with Gobernador and it tasted somewhat bland.***Yes there are much better taco shops in Los Angeles (e.g. Tacos Baja in East LA, Ricky's Fish Tacos, Guisados, etc), but I would still recommend Baja Fish taco and I wouldn't mind re-visiting this place if I actually live in Toronto.

Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos,"EXCELLENT California-style tacos!One thing that's important to note when considering tacos is that there are different styles of tacos, all of which diverged in the states in which there was a large influx of Mexican immigrants. Of the American tacos, there are two major styles: Tex-Mex, and California Mexican.Seven Lives serves up California Mexican tacos - a style of taco that emerged from the bountiful amounts of seafood surrounding the state. Remember: Mexico is not a country that is known for their seafood, and the most populous city in the country, Mexico City, is smack-dab in the middle of the country - meaning that access to good, fresh seafood is limited. American tacos are different from the traditional Mexican tacos, but that does not make them any better or worse. In my opinion, this fusion of styles is one of the things that make food culture so wonderful. Dissemination of ingredients and techniques native to areas new to immigrants can create fantastic new ideas, and has been directly responsible for some of the greatest food innovations in history.To me, the most important ingredient in a taco is the salsa. My favourite thing about Mexican cuisine are the complex spices, which often complement the seemingly simple dishes. Seven Lives has quite possibly the best salsa that I have had in Toronto. Had the spiciest one, and there was certainly a kick. Tried the Adobada and Baja Fish, both of which were absolutely fantastic.",4.0,5.0,957,2018-01-21,43.654341,-79.40048,Mexican

Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos,My friend suggested that we go to eat tacos at her favourite taco place - Seven Lives! I had super high expectations coming here because 1) I've never had tacos before 2) the line was long (good indicator of delicious food!) 3) yelp reviews were through the roof!I got theCarnitas - braised pork shoulderPollo asado - spicy grilled chickenThe food took around 10-15 minutes to prepare because of the long wait line but they employees were working to keep up with the pace. I put mild sauce on my tacos and had a seat and was ready to inhale my food. First impression was that they put lots of meat in it so you're getting more than enough for what you're paying. Second is that the tacos are greasy (so avoid if you don't like oily stuff). Third is that the food was piping hot!I did like the tacos but they were okay and it didn't blow me away.

For $6, though, you do get a pretty good taco. We got the Gobernator, which came out very hot but obviously fresh. Flavors melded together pretty well, though the small fish bits and large shrimp pieces were hard to keep together into bites.There isn't much eating space inside, but the tacos are quick to eat, so there will probably be enough turnover for you to find space.",4.0,4.0,957,2017-10-05,43.654341,-79.40048,Mexican

For whatever reason, I thought it'd be cheaper than it was. Tacos are now $6 each. They're rather large tacos, but they're still not the cheap eat a good taco should be. This place is super busy, even right after opening.  We had the octopus taco and the beef cheek/head taco. Both were good. The octopus was a tad salty, but with the tortilla, it was alright. They have one table, and then two bar counters. I'm not sure whether there used to be bar stools for the bar counters, or their bar counters were made for really tall people. I'm 5'4, and I did not enjoy trying to use the counter to eat. I ended up just holding my taco basket in one hand, and my taco in the other. I'd say this is a nice taco. Like a gentrified taco.

The breading here is way too heavy-handed and the perfect taco does not need a thick line of mayo to enhance its flavor. The rich, buttery texture of the fish itself should be enough lubricant for its journey down the esophagus.The wait here is ridiculous and there aren't even enough sidewalks outside so by the time you find a spot to enjoy your extravagant street tacos in Kensington, they will be cold.",4.0,3.0,957,2017-12-03,43.654341,-79.40048,Mexican

Gusto 101,"Gusto 101 has a rustic and lively vibe along with a quieter upstairs for those who prefer a more intimate setting. Starting with appetizers, the Tuscan Fries ($7) were solid choice to munch on with or without the garlic aioli. The Mozzarella di Bufala ($19) was an okay dish but the cheese-to-accompaniments ratio was off; ended up having to eat cold mozzarella by itself. Onto their pastas, their most popular Mafalde ai Funghi ($19) had a creamy sauce that was delicious and comforting but the Bucatini con Sugo di Vitello ($20) was quite bland. Overall, I found both pastas to be too al dente for my taste.For drinks, they offer a house red or white wine for $1 per ounce! I had the Gusto Rosso, which tastes like you would expect from a wine on tap. Despite the hype, I found the menu quite hit or miss.

Let me be the first to tell you that the pictures do not do it justice. This delicate dish has to be absorbed to believe. The oyster mushrooms and truffle cream sauce is everything that you are imagining that it could possibly taste like (I picture you salivating at this very moment).

Gusto 101,"I just got back from a very pleasant evening at Gusto 101.  This place has been in my bookmarks list for a while, but I'm glad to say I finally made it there tonight.  Gusto 101 is located in a former auto body shop and they've really emphasized that motif here; the restaurant is replete with motorway signs and license plates on the walls, and oil cans and drums as garbage cans in the restroom.My brother joined me this evening from out of town, and we were looking for a place to eat with a kitchen that stays open late.  I tried calling up to confirm this, unfortunately the reservation line closes at 6 PM.  Luckily we were able to walk in, and were reassured upon arriving at 10:40 PM that the regular menu was still available until 11 PM, but that they would then switch to the late night menu, so the kitchen would remain open late, yay!My brother ordered the beef tartare, and was surprised at the relatively large size.  This isn't my area of expertise, I mention it to note that Gusto 101 offers good value for money spent.I will point out that bread for the table costs $4, however that gives you quite a decent sized bag (made of washable paper!) of house made bread that is very filling.I skipped the appetizer and went straight for my main: Mafalde ai Funghi.  I realize it looks a little small in the photo I took, but rest assured it was a very nice portion of delicious mushrooms and Mafalde pasta in a delicious truffle cream sauce.  I came away from it very satisfied.My brother opted for the Sunday special (they offered it today on a Saturday because they're closed tomorrow for the Christmas holiday).  This was a lasagna with fennel sausage ragu, mushroom, tomato, and bechamel sauce with bacon.  If not for all the pork, I would have gone for this myself.  Again my brother remarked at how he was expecting a small portion, but instead he was treated to a plate full of delicious lasagna, and he couldn't even finish it!On the drinks front I was a bit disappointed, because I ordered a sweet cocktail and asked to hold the lemon, but was told they couldn't customize anything.  I tried going for a different drink that didn't have lemon listed, unfortunately when I received it I discovered it too had a very noticeable citrus taste, which I dislike.  Luckily they were very understanding, and I was able to order another drink, this time opting for a straight bourbon that worked out quite well.Finally on to dessert!  I went for the Pere, a dessert of local pears, brown butter, amaro, almonds, and white chocolate cream.  Wow!  I wasn't sure what to expect, but when I took a bite I was overcome by the sweet pears, the sweet cookie bits, and the delicious white chocolate!  Take a look at my photo to get a better idea.  I was really impressed by this dessert, so much so that I was tempted to get a second helping!My brother went for the Bombolone, an Italian donut stuffed with Nutella crema, espresso, and cardamon, a perfect Sufganiya analogue for the Hanukkah season ;)A note about the restroom, unfortunately signage is lacking in this department.  The restroom is located on the basement level, accessible via a staircase next to the front entrance.  It is unfortunately very easy to overlook it, and both myself and another patron were confused even after locating it because it's a single large room with alternating stalls marked ""M"" and ""W"", and a communal sink area with a single hand dryer (points for being a Dyson, though).I really enjoyed my evening here, and I'm excited to visit again in the near future.  Thank you Gusto 101!",4.0,5.0,691,2017-12-23,43.645002,-79.400309,Italian

All the ingredients taste fresh and I can feel they took the extra effort to making each dish. Purple kale as side were delicious as well, topped with artichoke vinaigrette. The potatoes were not crispy as described though. My partner ordered the Uova in Camicia ($13.50). It's basically eggs bennedict with mortadella on focaccia. This was extra unique from their choice of ingredients! I would definitely come back again to try out their dinner menu.

Gusto 101,"I thoroughly enjoyed this place. We came on a weekday 7pm-ish and it was already packed inside. They do have a bar area on the second floor which was a lovely rooftop patio.What I really liked:- beef tartare - great flavours that were not too heavy- kale salad - bigger than I expected. Great flavours that balanced the bitterness of the kale. The dressing was light and didn't over power any of the flavours- mushroom pasta - loved this! It was wonderfully creamy and aromaticWhat I thought was OK:- prosciutto pizza - all right, not my favourite toppings (arugula too bitter and prosciutto too salty for my liking) but the crust is very crispy and thin which i lovedOverall, great atmosphere and great service.

Gusto 101,"Came here at 6pm with a reservation on a Saturday evening. We came here for our anniversary dinner because the first time, the food was so good. I'd say this second time around, the experience wasn't as great. The food was fine, we got the pumpkin ravioli and the meatball pizza. Like the first time, the crust is thin and crunchy and great to dip in olive oil. The meatball was soft but bouncy, and tasted like a sausage. The pizza was good, though I still prefer the Margarita pizza.The pasta comes in about 9 ravioli pieces, covered in delicious roasty brown butter sauce and toasted pumpkin seeds and pine nuts. Honestly, it tasted like warm shortbread Christmas butter cookies, yum! The pasta was rolled thin, had some chew to it, and had small cubes of pumpkin around the dish.The only downside to this place is that it's so loud that we had to yell at each other the whole time. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're on a first date, or if you want to have a nice conversation with a friend. I recommend coming early if you want to hear each other. The place starts to get really packed around 7-8pm.Also, the service lacked presence. Maybe because it was a busy night, but the server was always away attending other tables. We had to wait a while each time we wanted something; to get extra olive oil, to get the bill, to get the credit card machine. They didn't even have time to ask how was our food.Good food but pick an off-peak time to go!",4.0,3.0,691,2017-11-26,43.645002,-79.400309,Italian

Gusto 101,"Came here for an early birthday dinner and had a wonderful time! Food 4/5: We started with the Cavolo Nero, a lovely kale salad which was light and fresh. I really liked the vinaigrette. For my main I had the Mafalde ai Funghi which was delicious. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was creamy and rich. My friend ordered the Regina Margherita which had a crisp crust and the tomatoes were sweet and bursting with flavour. For dessert we ordered an espresso with biscotti, the Brioche con Gelato and tiramisu. The dessert wasn't my favourite. The tiramisu was dusted with what I think was coffee grinds but it was a bit like eating sand, the espresso was too strong and while the gelato was nice, the Brioche was basically a hamburger bun.Atmosphere 5/5: I think my favorite thing about the night was their beautiful patio. Even though it was mid October it was still warm outside and they had plenty of heaters. They also have lights in the surrounding bushes. It was very cosy and romantic, great place for a date!

They also have daily wine specials for $1 for an 1 oz. I went on a weeknight for a late dinner and I had to wait about 20+ mins. I believe they have two levels but I heard this place is always pretty crowded so expect a wait. Good for young adults and a good place to drank wine and food after work.

Don't know what that cheese called, but it was full of buttery characters! The truffle cream sauce pasta is another must other! Like don't ask question, just order it and you will feel it!

Gusto 101,"I thought there was no way it could meet the hype but it really did! Amazing flavours, great service, and a beautiful restaurant.Went here on a Wednesday evening without a reservation, which is apparently risky business. At 6:30 we were given the only available cramped seats in front of the bar, which was honestly fine by me. The restaurant did get very loud however and it was difficult to talk to my friend even though we were squished right beside each other. The bartender at the front doubled as a waiter. He gave us great suggestions on drinks as well as the food. It seems like all the staff are well trained on the menu as he was even able to recite the ingredients in our salad when we asked! Really great and speedy service.We ordered only 2 dishes. The funghi pasta and the kale salad. The funghi pasta has got to be my FAVORITE pasta ever. It was honestly love at first bite. The thick al dente noodles had the right amount of bite. And the amazing aroma of truffles still resonate in my nose. And oh my gosh the SAUCE. So creamy and flavorful. While I usually feel like I need some sort of meat to complete my meal, this was not the case. Every bite was so appetizing! HIGHLY recommend.The kale salad was also very good! A bit steep in terms of pricing but I think it was a good portion and really nice flavors. I believed the kale was steamed, long enough to bring out flavors but not be soggy. There was also a combination dried currants, pine nuts, and lemon. I'd say it was quite robust yet balanced in flavour. Lastly, may I mention they have $1 per oz wines? I definitely wouldn't consider myself a sommelier by any means but I really enjoyed my cold glass of sauvignon blanc along with my meal. Overall, its really an aesthetically pleasing restaurant with amazing food and service but super loud!!

Walk past the huge mural of Lucy van Pelt in black shades and the entrance is just to the left of the patio space.

Don't know why I was placed there since there were plenty of other tables available at the time. Unfortunately, I could feel the heat of the wood fire grill from my seat (recovering from a cold but still felt the heat) and had to ask to be moved to another table. The service was great otherwise, just needed to get over the hiccup with the seating.We had the housemade bread, Cavolo Nero, Ravioli di Zucca, and a pizze (don't remember which one). Everything was well made and delicious and I appreciated the rustic elements of each dish. The portion size is a little small compared to the price, but that is expected for this area of town.

Gusto 101,"Today is my second day in Toronto and I love this city! Last night we had dinner at Gusto's (which means tasty in Italian). The restaurant was rated the Top Italian Restaurant of 2017 in Toronto which I'm confidant was given to them for their Mafalde ai Funghi, which is literally to die for! I mean who doesn't love a rich truffle? This dish consists of portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms and the most mouth watering truffle cream sauce you've ever had. The second dish I was very impressed with was theCavalo Nero!  This dish changes the way I've ever felt about a kale salad. It's BOMB. The salad consists of organic lacinato kale, zante currants, toasted pine nuts, pecorino, parmigiana, and a delicious lemon vinaigrette. The ambience felt more of a local crowd, who were just dining at their favorite neighborhood spot. In the context of just casual dinning I couldn't give Gusto's any less than 4 Stars.",4.0,4.0,691,2017-11-07,43.645002,-79.400309,Italian
Gusto 101,"I have been wanting to try this place for a veeeery long time and so glad I finally did. Came on a Sunday evening and sat on the rooftop patio. The patio is great minus having to walk down two flights of metal stairs to get to the bathroom. Ordered the cavolo nero (kale salad) and mafalde ai funghi. These two were the perfect combo of something light and refreshing with creamy and heavy. The kale salad was one of the best I've ever had. It was massaged to a perfect softness yet remained crunchy. The dressing was more on the sour side, but I loved it as it was a great compliment to the pasta. The pasta was perfectly al dente. I loved the chewiness of the noodles and the creamy mushroom sauce with a hint of truffle flavour. There was something really addicting about the noodles and I kept eating and eating without taking a break. The one off-putting part of the meal was that I'd get random bits of rock hard mushroom. One of my least favourite things while eating is when I crunch down on something I shouldn't be (ie. egg shell, grit, bone or anything hard).

GB Hand-pulled Noodles,"Got there at 12:15pm and there was a line out the door. It was freezing out, but I had asked a friend to meet me here, so I decided to wait. The line did move quickly, but the door was such a pain! Every time someone opened it, it would stay open and it allowed all the cold air in. It definitely did not make the dining experience comfortable when you were sitting there freezing. We had to sit with four other people at a communal table, and our waitress was quick to get our order and we got the food in under 10 minutes. Unfortunately because of the language barrier, we had a hard time asking questions, so we settled for what we understood in the menu. I decided to  to get their regular dish with beef. Though I don't care for fatty beef. The portions are generous and the noodles are delicious. The broth was okay, but a tad too spicy - and I don't mind spice. My friend got the vegetarian option and could not finish her broth. We wanted to take it go, but we were not given the option and decided not to bother asking for a container.

I got the vegetarian soup with thick noodles for take out so i didn't eat in. It was nicely packaged and reasonably priced but I wasn't too impressed by the flavors as they weren't much.

GB Hand-pulled Noodles,"Gosh this place makes me so happy. I've been to Homemade Ramen and Lanzhou noodles, but do these noodles hit just the right spot. Food (4/5): With a nice clear broth that is neither too strong nor too light, a bit of hot chili oil (by choice, you can choose to add more), the meat, the radish (?), and of course the hand pulled noodles you've got yourself the perfect meal on a cold winter's day. Obviously the noodles are the star here. A fan of the flat noodle variety, the noodles hold together well and are a great chewy texture. They also suck up the flavour of the soup such that each mouthful is flavourful. Also really enjoyed the thin but large slices of radish, really added that fresh kick of crunch between bites! The only reason soup doesn't get a perfect score is the meat. Not a fan of the thinly sliced shank (?). The meat with the clear veins running through it. Would prefer shank thicker and a different choice of meat for this soup.Cost (3.5/5): okok, the noodles are handmade and the soup is great, however it is on the pricey side. I got a small, my bf got a large and both our meals came up just around ~$27 with tax and tip. We exited full and warm inside, but it's not the most economic choice.Service (3.5/5): standard and quick. Not much so say here.Ambience (4/5): mixing it up with asian and english songs, I liked dining in here. It's a fairly small space but you feel like you're in a noodle house.

GB Hand-pulled Noodles,"Walking in to realize it is actually a small diner, the design of the restaurant actually doesn't quite flow, at most 30 customers at a time and I can see servers bumping into each other. The servers are not the best experienced ones as they are pre-occupied with whatever that they have at hands and do not have the flexibility to greet customers at the entrance. Typical sign of asian places, do not expect wonderful customer service but they are polite and hard working.Ordered the signature noodles (large) extra spicy - very good broth, quite clear, and the spicy level is just the right heat. I absolutely loved the fact that they let you pick the width of the noodles, this means that they hand pull the noodles as you order! I honestly do not think there are a lot of places that can offer that kind of customization and we are talking about downtown Toronto! Not even a lot of places in Markham offers that. I picked ""Flat"" because flat noodles are hard to find. Al dente!!!!!!Overall 4 stars due to below average of customer service but food is good, price is very reasonable and quick dine in and out.

My friend says there are usually line ups for this place, so to my surprise, there were at least 6 empty tables at this time - so we didn't have to wait (and I only had an hour for lunch anyways). We were greeted and seated immediately and handed the one page menu. Very brief and simple, not many choices. My friend and I both got a small noodle bowl. The size was decent, and the noodles were made fresh (very uneven though, some thicker and wider than others, and clumped up in bunches). The soup however... maybe it was my taste buds being altered by being sick, but boy, the soup was super salty, and tasted like boiled tap water... I did not have the stomach to finish the rest of my bowl as I hated the taste tap water.. let alone hot tap water!Although this was a neat place to try out... it's more like a once in a life time sorta deal. :P",4.0,2.0,286,2017-10-10,43.656641,-79.383747,"Chinese , Noodles"
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,"I have hopped onto the East Asian rice noodle soup bandwagon and I'm not seeing a trainwreck up ahead anytime soon!  I have seriously bucket listed over 30 noodle restaurants and this was one of my most anticipated stops.  Let me conclude before even beginning my explanation: I was very satisfied.The restaurant has gravely limited seating, so even at 7pm during a Thursday evening, there was a lineup out the door.  If you're impatient with waiting and if you're more apprehensive about waiting outside when the colder weather hits, this may not be the best choice to frequent during peak hours.  However, the workers do try to work through the line as efficiently as possible, as there will be a runner going down the line to take orders before you're even seated.  Note that because of this need for efficiency, the runner will zip through the explanations and questions as quickly as humanly possible (as if you've cranked up the play speed on a video by 3X).  Therefore, you'll get the awkward vibe that the worker isn't friendly and has no time for you. My advice: Just live with it and don't take offense to it 'cause it's a prerequisite to receiving your delicious noodles. One of the best qualities of this establishment is that, like many Chinese noodle restaurants, you have the liberty of creating your dream noodle dish. You get to select the type of noodle, the size of the bowl, and the level of spiciness.  They have handmade noodles made in front of you like a public performance as well as SEVEN noodle varieties, which was extremely exciting for me as I'm used to being restrained to up to four varieties at most noodle shops. Prices are reasonable here, so you don't have to hold back from getting a large size either. My friend and I decided to split a mega bowl, which fed two hungry hippos quite well! The only negative I have about the menu was the fact that they only have two dish varieties and their protein seems to be isolated to beef. However, they've made a name for themselves with these limitations, so they serve some mean noodles nonetheless!Receiving the mega bowl was as exciting as opening up a Christmas gift. It was very aromatic and the spicy kick complimented the other spices and herbs in the broth.  The noodles had a nice chewiness to them, which you could tell resulted from the dough being hand-pulled rather than store-bought. The broth also wasn't excessively oily, so I didn't have to hold back from slurping up the soup while eating. I was a happy camper.If you're exploring Chinese noodle soups, I highly recommend checking this restaurant out.

GB Hand-pulled Noodles,"I'm behind on reviews but I went here on October 27th 2017 for dinner with a friend.  We were in the area looking for food and decided to come here thanks to Google. We just made it in before the dinner rush (arrived around 5:30pm) and each ordered a bowl of noodles (I got the beef tendon noodles and my friend got the pork sauce noodles).  The portion was a good size and tasted pretty good.  The downside was the wait -- since the noodles are hand-made, you have to wait a while for your order.  We were seated at the bar, so we watched the kitchen staff prep the bowls.When we were done, there's not much of table service, so you need to go to the front to pay.  It's already super crowded and congested at the entrance, not to mention the restaurant itself is tiny, so you're awkwardly hovering while the staff ask you where you sat and what you ate before you can get the bill and pay.By the time we left, the line was already spilling down the street... unsure if it's because of the hype or that the noodles are amazing, but for folks who work and live downtown, this is probably one of the few places you can get hand-pulled noodles.  Otherwise, try other places uptown in Scarborough or Markham -- it's much cheaper there.",4.0,3.0,286,2017-12-23,43.656641,-79.383747,"Chinese , Noodles"
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,"So much hype about this place, but I wasn't thrilled after my visit. First of all, everyone who was waiting in line was congested at the entrance. Is it that difficult to tell people to form a line outside? Many noodle/ramen places do that even when it's raining or snowing. The place aside from the entrance is super congested too. It's a tiny store. Maybe u can spare that huge area for the noodle chef for customers who are actually paying the bills.Chinese noodles - they are everywhere in Markham. Price is steep for the food, but not steep for an area like downtown Toronto. Food came and I was truly disappointed. I wouldn't believe the noodles are handpulled freshly if i didn't see him doing it live. Meat and broth were decent though, not too salty. Something new for downtown Toronto. Maybe my tastebuds were too spoiled because I visited GB soon after my vacation in China. But this store would not survive in Markham where it's full of people used to eating authentic food from their hometown. Not a fan.",4.0,2.0,286,2017-12-08,43.656641,-79.383747,"Chinese , Noodles"
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,"I wasn't a huge fan of this place.1) The entrance way was packed full of people - 5 people standing there and it felt super congested. I know it's not the restaurants fault, but it's not that difficult to ask people to form a line outside instead.2) The place is super tiny. It was a mission trying to squeeze in between chairs to get to our table, and I'm not a big person by any means. Also add in the fact that it's winter so everyone has their giant puffy down jackets, adding to the congestion. Maybe don't add so much seating in a small place?3) The window I was seated next to was literally covered in condensation, and the floor next to it was really wet. That's kinda gross and is a breeding ground for mold.Finally, the food. I didn't understand the hype. If you blindfolded me and fed me noodles from here and any other noodle place I wouldn't know the difference. They just tasted like any other noodle shop over in Chinatown or Markham.Their service was pretty indifferent too. They have the appeal of fresh, hand pulled noodles,  but that's basically it.

GB Hand-pulled Noodles,"I suggested trying this place for dinner before going to a concert nearby. When my friends saw the line and the tight space, they were not very enthusiastic about eating here. But their tunes quickly changed when they got their orders and by the time we left, everyone agreed it had been a great choice. The noodles were absolutely fresh, tender and delicious and the soup broth was tasty, not too salty but quite flavourful and but the meat was a bit overcooked. My friend raved about her dry noodle dish. If you're willing to tolerate waiting in line (we waited about 10-15 mins) and squeezing in, it's definitely worth it.

Ramen Isshin,"best ramen in toronto! (tied with ramen kyuoka near the beaches) i've tried konjiki, hoikkado, sensotei, and kinto ramen and hands down, this place exceeds the other places in flavours, uniqueness, and portion sizesbeen coming here for the last year and i'm finally writing a review because i was not a yelpie beforei always get my ramen with a side order of their rice (a dollar cheaper than ordering separately). although the rice is very simple, their taste is anything but that. the rice has a hint of sweetness and the meat is so tender and juicy. and the nori + mayo toppings elevate the flsvour to the next leveli normally get their black tan tan noodles because i love spicy food and the price is good and it has never disappointed me. the last time, i decided to get red dragon ramen and i was so happy and satisfied! the bowl was a party central to all the flavours and texture. i finished everything and drank all tbe broth! there were tons of toppings and i liked the fact that they included a full size red chilli pepper in their bowlhighly recommend this place",4.0,5.0,6,2018-01-20,43.650291,-79.383952,Ramen
Ramen Isshin,"I have been having ramen at Isshin for years since they opened their first location on college and was happy to see them in the Chef's Assembly Hall. Ramen Isshin has always served one of the more serious and flavourful ramens in town and this new location keeps up the tradition.The broth and the chashu (pork meat) were flavourful, deep and satisfying. I had the shoyu flavour and was again impressed. It is even more impressive that they can whip up such a good broth, toppings and keep it deeply warm in their kiosk.There are definitely kinks and faults to be had however. While their ramen is much better than inferior stuff Kinton, and some others, serves it is spiced with MSG. One can tell because of the nerve tinglings and thirst that follows. Secondly the prices are higher than average. It always amazes me that expensive Japan has ramen all over the country for $8-$9 and at such large portions and ramen has to be $15+ in Canada! Finally, this is a food court, which means disposable bowls and spoons. It is unfortunate.At Isshin stick with the shoyu ramen and give a miss to the novelty of spicy this and spicy that. Also skippable are appetizers as they are nothing special. The atmosphere of the food hall is fun and there is much to choose from. It is accessible from The PATH, which is anther bonus.The employees at this location were jovial and friendly and they had a large menu full of options, but no tsukemen!!! Back to the original location for that...By the way, Unlike Uncle Tetsu, Pablo and most fake sushi restaurants and izakayas in town here the employees are Japanese 9and obviously are doing a great job with their ramen).",4.0,4.0,6,2018-01-19,43.650291,-79.383952,Ramen

Finally a great ramen joint that I can access from the path, now it's easy to cure my lunch time ramen cravings.I must admit that I had never heard of Isshin prior to visiting the Assembly hall. But am I ever glad that it found its way into my life. My first visit I ordered the rich shoyu ramen, which has the addition of pork belly fat to the broth. The broth was rich and flavourful, just what I needed for an extremely cold day. The pork belly was tender, I just wish there was more than two thin pieces. On my second visit I ordered the white sesame shio ramen. The broth was much lighter in both texture and taste. I also really liked the addition of mushrooms and bamboo shoots. Overall Isshin serves a tasty bowl of ramen! The noodles are thin and have a great chew to them. The broth is flavourful and the pork is tender.

The broth is rich and smooth, the noodles just the right amount of chewiness and texture, the soft boiled egg to die for, and the flavour is exquisitely delicious.Appetizers were average, but then that's really not the main point...service was very nice and friendly, given that this is a food hall downtown we're talking about.

The quality of ramen is the same from the original, just served in tossable bowls instead. Currently, the ramen that requires wok-fried toppings (spicy miso for example) aren't available yet, but I was assured that they will have it very soon so the menu isn't limited at all.

Onnki Donburi,"Quietly tucked away in Hayden Street, this don place is perfect for lunch and dinner in the Yonge/Bloor area! Simple white and natural wood colour décor with gray flooring keeps it modern and clean. Since discovering the spot, it seems they've picked up fast on Ritual. Miso soups and don bowls were flying into their takeout boxes and crowds of people came in to pick up their orders. The open concept kitchen lets you see everything, and the bar stool benches for dining in provide a hybrid of intimacy and community unique to small shops such as these (think ramen shop, but modern décor). What brings us back is definitely the convenience and so far, the no-complaints about the menu items. We were craving dons and this spot popped up. It was a late weeknight, activity was slow, the place was quiet and calm. We picked out the Japanese curry don (update: not on the menu currently in Jan 2018) and their signature Buta Fire don. We also got their karaage to top up the meal. It was a bit of a wait, but we did see the kitchen progressing and felt reassured. The karaage is crunch and flavourful, moist and served hot - no complaints. The curry don I got vegetarian, which was more than sufficient as we had the karaage as well. The curry sauce was flavourful and just the right level of spice for me (basically mild kick) which meant I could still taste the other flavours. The Buta Fire comes topped with tons of pork, and also has a small kick of spice to round out its flavour. Both dons were satisfying and immediately made it on the roster of go-to meals near the office.Recent visit rotated out the curry don and was replaced by the sake lover - salmon and wasabi, a deconstructed salmon maki roll almost. Lots of salmon sashimi, a good amount of wasabi (more than I needed) and rice with cabbage, crisps, and mayo. It wasn't as refreshing as expected, but satisfied the ""I want sushi"" craving while still being a filling meal.",4.0,4.0,46,2018-01-24,43.669837,-79.384651,"Japanese , Diners , Soul Food"

Onnki Donburi,"First time coming here after I saw good reviews online. We weren't disappointed! We both got Buta Fire $10.9 - grilled pork belly on rice! It was cool that the kitchen was open-concept so we could all watch them in action.  For the pork belly, they first grilled it, then pan fried it over high heat, then finished by torching. Each cook in the kitchen seemed very focused and organized - one does the pork belly, one does sashimi, one cooks rice and finishing touches.  Buta Fire was delicious! The pork belly was amazing. It was a generous portion of meat on top of a bed of nicely cooked japanese rice. I just wished it had some vegetables to balance as I'm not a big meat eater. Since we sit at the bar, it would be great if the restaurant installed hangers underneath for lady's purses so we don't need to put it on the ground (it's great you have a coat rack at the back already). We waited around 10 minutes to get our orders in, so you may need to expect that. The waitresses were very kind and busy, and I entertained myself by watching the kitchen staff, so it was okay.

It's a great place to dine alone because all their seating are up against the wall or toward the kitchen like bar seating.It's a little hidden down one street from Bloor but it's worth the trip.

Onnki Donburi,"Onki Donburi is a little difficult to find.  Trust me, don't go by your Google maps, as there is construction and it will tell you to traverse several buildings.  Loop around church and follow the narrow path called Hayden until you see a spa parlour. Onki Donburi is next to it. However, once you do find it, you'll enjoy the interior design.  The white and brown colour palette creates a chic yet minimalistic impression. For all you fellow clean freaks, the washrooms are spotless and organized as well. They even have an open kitchen, which is refreshing.  Just don't expect any performances, so I wouldn't encourage you to scramble to get a seat in front of the  kitchen. In terms of seating, you will only have the option of high top seating in rows. Since you won't be able to sit across from your party members, Onki is not suitable for medium to large sized parties that enjoy lively conversation among multiple members across the table. The best you will be able to do is speak to the person on either side of you, so this establishment is perfect for a date or a 2-3 person party.Now, in terms of the food, don't set a high bar even though Onki Donburi is trending. Last Friday, my friend and I were a little disappointed with our meals. The dishes were not terrible; they were just decent.  For example, we ordered the Onki Karaage and I found the breading to be thicker than average, which took away from the potential juiciness of the chicken flesh. Also, we ordered the Buta Fire and the Buta Red Fire to compare the two since we were told that the Buta Red Fire was the spicy version of the other.  Unfortunately, the sauce that differentiated the fire one from the other was sweet, not spicy, so I was crestfallen. On the bright side, there was a good ratio of meat to carbs, which is something to appreciate since a lot of establishments tend to be less generous with their portions of meat. Overall, however, the rice bowls were flavourful, but their flavours weren't complex and by all means they weren't  memorable.I wouldn't say you should go ham over this restaurant if you're out of the area because there are better alternatives out there.  However, if you're in the area, Onki Donburi is a pleasant spot to hit up with a friend or date if you're craving for Japanese grub that isn't sushi or ramen.

Onnki Donburi,"To start off, I just absolute love donburi bowls. Or maybe I just love rice. It's such a versatile base to eat anything with, and almost everything works wonderfully well with it. Onnki Donburi does Donburi super well. The mixture of toppings in terms of flavours and textures hits the spot. It warms your soul and makes you happy. I'm super glad we stumbled into this gem of a place. Came here with my partner in crime on a Friday night before Friday Night Live ROM, and lucked out because we beat the rush at around 6:30 before the massive waves of people started to arrive.The first thing you see when you step in is the incredibly simple, clean, and minimalistic aesthetic with an open kitchen with no tables at all. Enjoying your food being made in front of you was a joy to watch and stimulates all those salivary glands. Everything about this place was cute; especially their colourful ceramic bowls. We went with the karaage, their buta red fire, and sake lover don all which were delightful. The karaage was super crispy and was drizzled with a creamy mayo. I personally loved the extra crunch while my partner found it so crispy that it was on the hard side. The chicken was still very much juicy and that's all I could ever ask for in karaage; juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The sake don is an absolute must order if you enjoy salmon sashimi. There's crunchiness from the tempura bits and a whole lot of sweetness and creaminess from their sauces here. For good measure, there's even pickled ginger and wasabi; it's a very complete dish. However, I would add it might be almost too sweet since all the individual components are sweet themselves. The buta red fire was equally as excellent. Their juicy pork belly (grilled right in front of our faces) was coated with a gochujang based sauce with a nice, mild kick while the abundance of sweetened onions added a nice crispness and extra sweetness. There was also a mayo base on the rice, the extra creaminess is always a welcome addition. Portions were just right and the excellent ratio of proteins to rice here ensured you would have just enough rice to go with your proteins. Typically other donburi restaurants would load up on the rice while cutting back on the rest of the toppings.",4.0,4.0,46,2017-11-09,43.669837,-79.384651,"Japanese , Diners , Soul Food"
Onnki Donburi,"A small little restaurant tucked away in a quiet street on Hayden street by Yonge. This place gets busy super fast so expect long lineups during peak hours. Note: they don't serve water during lunch time, it's a bit strange and they're very limited in seats so come early. They have an open kitchen and it's cool sitting at the counter to watch all the variety of meats getting grilled. Really sets the bar higher for your hunger meter, feel your mouth water!There's very few meals on the menu, not a lot of variety but it's rice bowls so they have all the popular dishes people are normally used to. I just wished they had a mixture of meats combined, but I guess that would take away the authenticity of the dish. I came here for dinner with the group, we ordered much of everything. Orders ranged from the galbi don, sake lover, ebi triple, katsu curry, and buta fire. I personally ordered the galbi don and it was delicious. The serving of meat was surprisingly decent; note, it doesn't say the meal comes with onions on the menu but it does get included in your meal so for all the onion haters out there like me, let your server know ahead of time. Anyway, the pickled radishes that came with the meal was really good and I wish they gave us some more of that. The other bowls were complimented by my friends so I can only assume they were good. There's a little table near the front that has water with cups, my friends were confused thinking water was self-serve but turns out the waiters will serve water during dinner. I think the self-serve is only during lunch. Overall a neat little shop and I'll definitely drop by if I'm in the area again.",4.0,4.0,46,2017-11-06,43.669837,-79.384651,"Japanese , Diners , Soul Food"

We ended up ordering katsu to start, the buta and the magic chasu donburis. The food came slow and the waitress forgot to put in our karrage order which we had to follow up on since we saw other people who came after us with their karrage. When it finally came, it was nicely presented but I found the breading to be too heavy. As for the donburi, the magic chasu was the better of the two. The buta is more flavourful but the magic chasu is more refined.

Rasa,"What can I say about Rasa.. besides that our whole night was exceptional! From walking into the restaurant we felt such a warm welcome and greeting from the hostess/host and manager. Although we did not have a reservation, we were luckily accommodated for a table for 2 and was immediately served water (water service is crucial always!) The style of Rasa is very tapas.. everything they make is smaller in portion size but nice to try multiple items and share with your party. We were so eager to try their menu and was provided great advice from the manager and our server... a Must is the chopped salad. It is not anything like a regular salad, has a great flavour and spice to it with the use of fried chick peas, feta cheese, kale, quinoa and other veg. Very refreshing and light tasting. We also tried the fish sampler, and it came with 3 different types... one was similar to a banh mi style shrimp toast with hoison sauce and green onions.. was very tasty, warm and delicious! Prob my favourite out of the 3 different types.. my husband really enjoyed the ceviche as it was flavoured and seasoned with pepper chilli oil, chives and peanut butter. The flavours were so intense and they actually jive so well! The third sampler we got was a red tuna and it was good but not memorable as the other two.We also got the burger since everyone has bene raving it is the best burger out there! It was delicious from the bun to the meat to the toppings... everything is made in house (even the burger bun!!) and it tasted juicy, meaty and had all the write toppings all together. This dish came with some home made root chips which was nice!Lastly, we ordered this truffle mushroom gnocchi style dish (don't remember the exact name..) but it was to die for!!!!! My favorite dish of the entire night. The gnocchi itself was super fluffy and super truffle tasting which i loved. It was also so nicely presented!!! Love love this dish and could go for some more.For dessert we got the sticky bun, it was good.. but i think next time we will try the lava cake instead. The sticky bun is huge though so can definitely share with 3 or 4 people after such a great meal.But i must condemn the staff at Rasa. Impeccable service, never felt out of place and was always taken care of.

We ordered 8 dishes:Chopped SaladBrussels SproutsTruffle MushroomPork RibsOctopusWagyu2 dessertsNothing disappointed me. Every single dish had an unique flavour with perfect spice. I also want to give a bonus star to their presentation. All dishes were aesthetically pleasing. My favorite was the Truffle Mushroom. I never tried such a flavorful dish with just veggies.

Rasa,"I've been to Rasa twice now and always with a small group, as they offer great sharing options. It's a small place and they get very busy, so be sure to make a reservation ahead of time, even on a weeknight. Announce your presence asap so they can start getting your table turned around if it hasn't been yet. On the last occasion, we ended up waiting an extra 30 minutes after our reservation time before we were seated. We saw two walk in couples get turned away and other groups waiting. We hung out by the front/bar area and ordered some drinks while we waited, not the most fun but it happens. After some time and without prompting, Rasa offered our first round of drinks on the house given our wait, which was thoughtful and appreciated. Food wise, the fish board is a must. So creative and an explosion of flavours. I also thoroughly enjoyed the lamb and duck, the truffle gnudi is another must if you love mushrooms. I think I could have done without the octopus but it was great nonetheless and I find octopus is tricky. On my first visit, I recall being pleasantly surprised with the freshness and variety of ingredients in the chopped salad too. The place is a bit dark so not great for photo snapping, but awesome for being detached to the phone and enjoying present company. I also appreciated that the drink list isn't two miles long but offered great variety. The staff are knowledgeable about their wine and drink offerings as well if you're unsure.I think next time I'll go back to try ""the experience ""!",4.0,5.0,176,2017-11-25,43.662775,-79.403968,"Canadian (New) , Tapas/Small Plates"

I am not from Toronto, and maybe restaurants are held to a higher standard here in Toronto compared to Vancouver, but I was thoroughly impressed by how everything tasted. I can't finish the review without also noting that our bartender was wonderful. She's experienced, has some of her own drinks on the menu, and made the whole night enjoyable. We were early, so we probably avoided some of the service/speed complaints I've read in other reviews. This was a great find.

Rasa,"Hidden gem or not? Restaurants on Harbour St are in such a dilemma location, between Annex &  Kensington/Queen W.  You just don't come here too often. I am so glad I FINALLY tried Rasa after bookmarking it for so long...Location/Decor: the address says Roberts St, it's door is actually on Harbor. Easy to find street parking, free after 9pm. Can also park on neighbourhood streets. It is very intimate vibe, exposed brick, exposed concrete, big wood beam, restored wood slab tables, leather high chair (my fav seat), big facing street window, cactus plants by the window. It's love at the first sight. Food: they change menu every month? Or season? I'm not sure. But few classic items remain on the menu (such as chopped salad, sticky bun, octopus). Because it's tapa style so we (two girls) ordered five dishes (including dessert). We were too full after four dishes. First dish, chopped salad. I am not a salad person AT ALL. I usually skilled all salad dishes when dining out. But this salad is a MUST-TRY. Few chopped veggies, quinoa, grapes, toasted crunchy chickpeas, with jelapño spread. Second dish STICKY BUN, we had them serve dessert as second course because we were just too hungry and figured dessert won't take long to come. It's another must try item. Tastes like warm cinnamon bun with toasted walnut and applewood bacon! We also order duck breast, octopus, and braised lamb. All of them are 9/10 in terms of flavours, presentation, creativity.

Rasa,"Haven't been to Harbord street forever after graduating from U of T and I thought it's still a small street with not much going on. Turned out I was wrong. In the recent year this neighbourhood has got some really great restaurants. Rasa is one of them. The restaurant is inside a house at a intersection. Looks like it's got a bit patio (for the summer). Once you get in you need to walk a few stairs down. I was instantly impressed with the vibe and the decor. It felt like an indie restaurant almost. Dim light but not so much. People are talking but not so loud. Busy but not packed. I loved it. The seats we got are two super super comfortable high chairs side by side facing the window by the street. Very intimate setting great for close friends or a date. We ordered 5 dishes - chop salad, octopus, braised lamb, duck breast and sticky bun. All of them came out really great. You can tell thoughts were put into the presentation, texture, and the taste. The sticky bun and the duck breast were especially incredible. The braised lamb very unique with a Persian touch. The octopus was tender and flavourful. There were only two of us and we ordered 5 dishes because usually portions at tapas restaurants are small but this is not the case for Rasa. The portion is quite decent and we got so full! The bill wasn't exactly cheap or expensive but it think it's worth it and of great value.",4.0,5.0,176,2017-10-19,43.662775,-79.403968,"Canadian (New) , Tapas/Small Plates"
Rasa,"I don't usually come to this area but I heard good things about Rasa and decided to check it out. The restaurant has quite a lot of outdoor seating, may be even more than the inside. I came without reservations and there wasn't a wait. I sat inside and the atmosphere was very cozy. It wasn't loud at all. Service: The server was friendly and welcoming. He explained the menu to me and my friend. He also made recommendations of his personal favorites. Our server was also very attentive and checked up on us frequently. Food: Chopped salad: this was their top menu item so of course I had to order it. It was well tossed and it had a bunch of everything. The jalapeño cheese sauce on the side of the peel was really delicious. I'll definitely order this again if I return. Octopus: the octopus dish was good. But it wasn't outstanding to me. The sauce was nice, it was very bold in flavor. Shrimp: the shrimp dish was good as well but nothing blew my mind.  Overall I had a nice experience at rasa. The service and food was great.

Rasa,"Updating my overall review after coming here for 2 brunches and 1 dinner.Dinner - 3.5 stars... great flavours but the food service was sooo painfully slow.  A little over 3 hours for a normal dinner.  We had spots of 45 minutes of no food in front of us. I'm not sure I can recommend this place for dinner.Brunches - 5 stars for food and service... just amazingWe finally got dinner reservations for this great spot.  Patio is open for the summer... a really nice spot to enjoy the warm sun.  The only problem is that the food service was painfully slow.  Other tables in addition to ours had the same problems and some other tables were complaining.  I wish it was better so I can keep this place at 5 stars but I honestly wouldnt recommend coming here for dinner.There are some bright flavours coming out of the kitchen but some of the food was served temperate warm and having no food for 45 minutes at a time, it was getting worrisome.  What I would have expected having 2 seatings... it was mostly one for most tables.  We saw so many people turned away and I can see why.  The kitchen just could not keep up or time the dishes to send out timely.  These are meant to be shared plates but they are on the slightly smaller side... so they do recommend 2 dishes per person... I would dare say 2.5 dishes per person more so.Some of the food we ateChopped Salad - Best salad in Toronto... its the one reason I keep coming here for brunches.  Zesty combination of the jalapeno, goat cheese, and avocado smear combines with many fresh chopped vegetables and the super crunchy chick peas.  It's a burst of fresh flavours... definite winner.Brussels Sprouts - Solid rendition of sriracha and cauliflower 'cheese' on cooked brussels.  I kinda liked them... they were served barely warm.  It would have been better if they were hot.Octopus, sous vide and then grilled - nice flavours and the octopus was very tender with nicely charred bits to add more flavour and crunch.  Unfortunately similar to the sprouts, it was served lukewarm.  I did like the roasted almonds and creamy coconut yogurt to give it added crunch and flavour.Shrimp - 4 medium large shrimp... it was served closer to room temperature and that was unfortunate.  The smokey tomato sauce was a nice flavour.  It just couldnt save the dish.Sticky Bun - This is a large caramelized bun that is served hot with some candied bacon and it sits on top of a cream cheese smear.  This was the 2nd best dish of the night and probably the hottest dish served.  Soft pillowy bread that has lots of crunchy walnut pralines pieces creating crunch and caramelized flavour.  This is a definite winner.Overall... good option for brunch but unfortunately I cannot recommend it for a dinner.  I know a full tasting menu of 6+ dishes not including amuse bouche and dessert is normal for a 3 hours session but this was more a painful waiting game of lukewarm but decent dishes.",4.0,3.0,176,2017-06-04,43.662775,-79.403968,"Canadian (New) , Tapas/Small Plates"
Rasa,"I have had a few people message me about Rasa and their interest in celebrating their special event at this restaurant. Last year I would have encouraged it, but today, I would dissuade you. I returned to Rasa for my birthday this year, and I was very disappointed with the experience. It was a completely different experience than the one I had last year. These were some of my concerns: My birthday fell on a Monday, so my guests and I ordered from the set Monday menu - we have been to Rasa many times for their set menu on Mondays, and it has become progressively less impressive. On this evening I asked for no onions - as I always have, and the waitress made my request difficult. The manager did come by to check in on us, and I mentioned to him how I wanted to order the shrimp dish, but was unable to because it had onions and it could not be omitted. He took care of it and arranged that it be made without onions - something I really appreciated. The meal itself was ok - not as tasty as it used to be, the portions were small, and the service was average. Several times during the meal my friends kept asking, ""what happened? Rasa used to be so good!"" And in fact, at my birthday dinner last year, they treated us to a glass of bubbly, I was given my favorite dish as the main, even though it was not on the menu, and I got a lovely gift - a gift card that I used for brunch several weeks later. And the service was top notch - they made me and my friends feel very special - and I said as much in my review. This time around I could not finish one dish - simply could not stand the flavor combinations - something I had never done before here. My favorite dish (the Bangkok bowl) is no longer on the menu, and they replaced it with a shrimp dish which was alright, but not as good as the tuna version. And after dinner was over, we were still really hungry (even the friends who ate everything on their plate), so I went home and cooked myself dinner - a thing I did not want to do on my bday. The cost for dinner was $40 plus tax and tip for three courses - sounds like a good deal, but the portions and options do not make this deal worthwhile. It used to be $35 for three courses and I used to leave full. Pros Some dishes still tastyManager does a good job when he steps inNice space Cons Small portionsSpotty serviceHit and miss on dishesIf doing a set menu, you won't get a full dessertI don't think I will be returning to Rasa, but appreciate all the wonderful dinners I had here over the years. :)",4.0,3.0,176,2017-05-29,43.662775,-79.403968,"Canadian (New) , Tapas/Small Plates"
Rasa,"If you're looking to go for a great meal and don't mind spending ~$65 a person (drinks not included), then Rasa would rank near the top of my list. Go for The Experience. Also, this place is rather small, so keep your party size to no more than 6 or else it's going to be difficult unless you make reservations in advance.I would strongly recommend going for at least 1 of each of their courses. (Appetizer, Entree, dessert). They do have a fried donut for $5, but we were full by the end of it, so we didn't get it.The chopped salad has received rave reviews from other people and I'd like to chime in that if there was a salad that I could go eat on a daily basis, this would be it (no becoming vegetarian thoughts yet). The chickpeas were a nice addition and the portion size was good. It was well-balanced and you can taste the fresh and the crunch with each bite. On a preference issue, it was somewhat hard to get the salad from the big bowl (presentation = beautiful btw) with a fork and then eat from the plate with the fork. I would have liked to use chopsticks. There was also a bacon dish that I probably should've taken, but I had salad.I had the burger for a main dish and my partner had the albacore tuna dish. Burger was smaller than I thought it would be, but was more filling than I expected. The burger meat was...so soft and juicy. I can still salivate on that memory even though I just ate lunch. The albacore tuna dish was tasty (of the small portion that I had). The dessert was a chocolate mousse. I would say that this was probably not the most satisfying way to end the meal, simply because it was the size of a chocolate truffle. To be perfectly fair, it was way better than any truffle I've tasted because it was so soft, smooth and creamy. It also helped that it simply melted instantly in your mouth.All in all, great meal. The ambiance inside the restaurant was great, not too loud or too soft, and the live music was a nice romantic touch. I couldn't figure out the beat because I suck, but my partner could, and that's all that mattered. Service was good and not overbearing. I did like the waiters' accents, they were cool.Service: 5/5Food: 5/5Price Point: 4.5/5 (I feel that it's still a tad too pricey, but everything was a bullseye)Overall: 5/5Note: They do NOT open on saturdays for brunch (they open at 5:30PM).

We had to wait for a long time between the courses. There is allowing time between the courses and there is painfully slow. We had the latter. The server had very little interest in us. She tried to take a plate I was still working on, right from under my spoon (and why such rush if I had to wait for my next dish for another 25 minutes)? I did not feel welcome at all.

Meat is extremely tender, the veggies (eggplants and parsley) had a unique sweet-ish salty taste to it. The white sauce at the bottom just makes the entire dish more perfect than it can even be.

STACK,"I'll take the words from my fellow Yelper Peter M. ""I really wanted to like this place."" That was my sentiment exactly. The place doesn't look much from the outside but inside, it's spacious, modern and clean. Washrooms also seems to have been renovated. It's actually a cool place to meet friends and hang out for a few drinks. The service was very good. Our waiter was attentive and our request always filled. They have a wide selection of beers and liquor including some craft beers. Unfortunately, the food we ordered wasn't on par with the decor and service. This place is not cheap but it's similar to the prices around this area. Also we did not order their BBQ meats. We had the Memphis Hot Chicken Sandwich and a Poutine with pulled pork. The buttermilk breaded chicken was really good but the combination of spices and sauce to make the spicy concoction made the sandwich taste off. The side was garlic mashed potatoes. The Poutine was just average. Nothing to make it stand out. I want to give this place another chance and get their Ultimate BBQ meats platter.

Surprised that itnis actually spacious inside.We ordered the Ultimate Platter which is now $84.99 to share plus a side of parmesan fries. I love the brisket but find they use the same bbq sauce on everything. It would be nice if they have all diff bbq sauce to choose from on the side. I love the fresh cut fries, it was cooked crispy. I highly recommend the parmesan fries, its a must!We also tried the s'mores doughnut dessert and I really liked it.

STACK,"Went here with a group of 12. Most of us ordered chicken or ribs and general consensus is that the food was really good. I personally got the Stack sized BBQ ribs with their standard jack daniel's sauce. Stack size just means full rack. It's been awhile (years) since I've had juice, meaty, fall off the bone ribs. Let's just say I finished my entire rack and wanted more. Very pleased. My side order was garlic mashed potatoes and that was also delicious. My friends ordered the key lime pie milkshake and strawberry milkshake. Both were heavenly good. They have gluten free options as well. For such a large group, our orders came reasonably on time.

The ribs were fall of the bone , the brisket was soft and flavourful. The BBQ sauces that they topped the meat with was the icing on a cake well done.

I ordered their brisket burger with a patty, bf ordered the brisket dinner, and friend ordered another burger (don't remember the name of it).Service was really slow which was unfortunate. But when the food arrived, all of it was really tasty and made up for the wait.The baked beans are some of the best that I've ever had and I ended up eating the whole thing. The brisket itself was very tender and tasty. Their jack daniels BBQ sauce is also really good - I would order some more on the side next time.My friend also really enjoyed his burger and said it was the best he's ever had.The only downsides about this place were the price, waiting time if you don't have a reservation, and service.

STACK,"It surprises me Stack doesn't come top of mind, when you think of barbecue in Toronto. Perhaps not being in the downtown core can be a bit of a trek for some, but in my two visits here, I've been pleasantly satisfied with my meals.We were a party of 3, and decided to split two BBQ dinners. We went with the Smoked Baby Back Ribs ($20) and the Half Pound of Texas Brisket ($18) which both came with fries, beans, and slaw. We decided to upgrade one of our fries to the Parmesan fries (for an extra charge), and substitute our other fries to extra slaw.The ribs were meaty and smokey, and fall-off-the-bone, with just the right amount of sweet Memphis BBQ sauce, without being overly saucy. The brisket was moist and tender, and again, with just the right amount of sauce, allowing you to appreciate the smokiness and cook of the meat. As for the accompanying sides, the fries were tossed in aioli with melted parmesan and still maintained a nice crunch; the beans were sweet and smokey, in a thick sauce (as opposed to a pool of sauce); and the slaw was a bit vinegary for my liking. We were happy we split two dinners, three ways, because with the accompanying sides, it was very filling.But we made sure to leave enough room for the doughnuts. Despite telling my two friends that one batch of doughnuts would be sufficient, we ended up placing two orders: Old Fashioned and S'Mores. Out came two full plates of made-to-order doughnuts, similar to those of Tiny Toms doughnuts. And for the record, we only managed to finish one plate.Overall, a filling and substantial meal and a restaurant worth trekking out to for some delicious barbecue!",4.0,4.0,228,2017-03-06,43.729286,-79.40309,Barbeque

STACK,"I like this place. The restaurant is laid out with thought. The decor is nice too. We were quickly shown to our seats when we walked in. Despite only having three people serving the floor things went pretty smoothly. I ordered the bacon burger minus cheese & mayo (dairy allergy) with a gluten free bun & a side order of sweet potato fries. Hubby had the Catfish with mash. The food was delicious. I think they forgot my sweet potato fries coz they came later than my burger. When they came the fries were nice and crispy in a lattice shape. Not too oily either, which is a pet peeve of mine. I tried a bite of hubby's catfish and it was delicious too. Our waitress was nice and efficient. When she was busy the other ppl serving the floor (2 guys) came by as well. The guy who was acting as expediter came by and said ""Awesome right?"" with a big smile and I smiled back and said ""Yeah!""  I visited the washrooms before we left and the women's was immaculate. Hubby said the men's was clean as well. I don't know how new this place is but everything was in tip top shape. And fastidiously clean. Another pet peeve of mine is when restaurants don't pay much attention to their washrooms. I've been in nice restaurants where the washrooms felt like the inside of a freezer and were a little dirty. I appreciate this place because everything was done really well. Food, service, decor, and washrooms were all great.

Konjiki Ramen,"Totally decent ramen alongside exceptional marketing.As you wait in line you cannot help to listen to people talking about ""Michelin Star Ramen"".   Which is a total misnomer.  Sure, the small location in Shibuya has been listed as a Bib Gourmand restaurant... but these are kinda a dime a dozen.  There ARE Michelin star ramen joints in Tokyo...  but unless you're willing to get to Tsuta or Nakiryu and wait in long line for their Dandan noodles you're out of luck. Back to Konjiki. This is a good ramen joint.  Actually, a very very good ramen joint.   But the inconvenience of having to wait through the hypefest to get inside is a bit of a diminishment to what otherwise is a fantastic meal.    The shoyu intense clam broth is an absolute delight.  I would dunk my head in the broth if it wouldn't kill me dead.  I also tried the spicy pork, which was also quite good.I wasn't a huge fan of the Karage chicken, but it could have been just in comparison to the ramen.   Also, my diet coke was flat.   But you can't win 'em all.It's the promise of the word 'michelin' that gets 'em through the door.   It's a door worth entering, but concentrate on the actual ramen and broth itself and enjoy the ride.",3.0,4.0,125,2018-01-30,43.767033,-79.411927,Ramen
Konjiki Ramen,"Tried the first international location of this Tokyo ramen restaurant by Chef Atsushi Yamamoto. Konjiki Ramen opened recently to much fanfare because of its Michelin guide Bib Gourmand listing for several years in a row (this is the Michelin section for excellent food with moderate prices). I've never been to the Tokyo location so I can't compare my experience here. But from photos I see some difference, esp w the cha-su (pork). Konjiki makes their own noodles in house, and the signature broth is chicken/pork based enhanced by clams. Modern touches include porcini mushrooms, truffles. I ordered the Intense Shoyu Signature Clam Broth Ramen.Bottom line: I was disappointed and not impressed. The broth was fragrant but flavour was somehow flat and lacked depth. The noodles were unremarkable. The egg was not runny. And the cha-su was dry and tasteless. I don't know how much is due to the newness of the place and kitchen staff, or the busy crowd on a Sun evening, but Chef Yamamoto will be returning to Tokyo in a few days after being here for a little while, so it'd be surprising if logistics is still an issue.Another problem could be it's impossible to replicate the same thing in Japan. You can't get the same type/quality of raw ingredients for the broth. The flour for noodles are different. And certain factors need to be slightly adjusted for Canadian taste (egg yolk runniness, pork fattiness). Could it be the chef is new to Canada and hasn't had time to adapt his recipe to local availability? I'm guessing. But I was definitely not impressed. I included a photo of the same shoyu ramen from the Tokyo location from the web and you can see the difference, esp in the cha-su (I accept that North Americans will not like pinkish pork but the fat-less extra lean cut used here makes it taste dry). But it's very disappointing. I was dining with another Japanese ramen chef from Tokyo and several other Japanese natives. All were disappointed.",3.0,1.0,125,2018-01-30,43.767033,-79.411927,Ramen
Konjiki Ramen,"Shibuya, Tokyo-based Konjiki Ramen - full name Konjiki Hototogisu or Golden Bird - is a Michelin enorsed (but not starred) ramen joint whose second location is in Toronto now several doors down from the progressively worse and worse Kinton (their broth and chashu really need to improve), Hakata Shoryuken (at least they offer a special local flavour and take on ramen) and Sansotei (whose tonkotsu neither tastes like nor smells like tonkotsu!).Konjiki offers clam-based broth, which is not uncommon in Japan, but is new for Canada.We arrived at 11:00, which is 30 minutes before opening time, and were at the head of the line. By the time they opened at 11:30 there were a good 30 people in line. This is an authentic Japanese restaurant so of course all our Chinese-Canadian friends are in line. Add to that Korean-Canadians and a smattering of others.They are not Michelin endorsed in Canada of course, but still their clam-based ramen (in white bowls) was good. They also have tonkotsu (pork bone broth), which i have to try another time, but I had their signature clam-based ramen and would say the shoyu is good and the shio is just average/medium. While I enjoyed the novelty of the clam broth, the shio had little taste. The shoyu was better. In both cases the chashu (pork meat) is really thin and stingy and looks like a cold cut sliced thinly. The ramen is $14 and I am sure they can make their chashu thicker to look like an actual piece of meat that belongs in a ramen! For the price an egg is not included either. The noodle also was a cross between a ramen noodle and soba noodle. This is not your standard ramen noodle. The waitress told us they make their own noodles in-house.In both cases the ramen had a pleasant aroma. The clam-based broth works best on the sense of smell.They also have below average chicken nuggets (karaage) and a vegetarian option for ramen.The service was polite, we got a quality check and the water is refilled as necessary. Unlike Santouka, however, not all employees are Japanese. The restaurant is clean, spic and span and on the way out you are funneled through a partnership's ice cream/cake store (very much the same trick used by Ikea) where you have to walk through the pastry shop. By the way a slice of Mont Blanc cake is $8. Not joking. I repeat: a thin slice is $8. Obviously Canada makes another millionaire out of another ramen entrepreneur.It is a  minimum of 30 minutes wait, and more likely 60 minutes, but give it a try if you like ramen because the chef/owner is returning to Japan next month leaving the restaurant in the hands of his trainees.We enjoyed the novelty of a clam broth, but shoyu is better than the watery shio and the novelty should wear off because the meat is so thin and the taste is not spectacular (just 'good').",3.0,3.0,125,2018-01-27,43.767033,-79.411927,Ramen
Konjiki Ramen,"Still needs a lot of improvement in terms of efficiency and organization. Went today around 1:15pm and waited for about 25-30 minutes until we were seated. We could have been seated earlier as there were tons of empty space but it took so long for any of the services to clean up and seat people in line. I was literally staring at 6 empty seats for a good 5-10 minutes.Our experience was further dampened when they sat us down at a table for 2 and then asked us to move to the bar stools a few minutes later. They just told us that the seat was meant for someone else even though we were next in line. Clearly, the table of 2 beside us were finishing up and they had wanted to merge the tables to accommodate for a group of four. We were fine with moving but they were so disorganized, they could have cleaned up the other area before asking us to move. But instead, we had to awkwardly stand around in front of the line again cause it took another 5 minutes for us to be seated in unpreoccupied bar stool seats. My boyfriend ordered the signature shoyu and I got smoky black tonkotsu so we could compare broth quality. Our food came out really quickly and to be frank, didn't think it was worth the wait. The ramen was kind of salty and didn't really have the umami taste I was expecting. Both the broths seem to lack a depth of flavour that gives it any wow factor, but it was still tasty. The braised pork belly was exceptionally tender and worth adding to your bowl for $3 (3pcs)! However, I was so utterly disappointed by the tamago - it's like cutting into an eggs Benedict and finding out the yolk is cooked. The inside wasn't runny and has a weird pasty consistency (as seen in my picture). Ramen tasted fine but nothing spectacular. Probably won't return for a while given our experience, would rather line up for Sansotei.+ I hate food that leaves me so thirsty and wanting to drink 3-5 glasses of water.",3.0,3.0,125,2018-01-27,43.767033,-79.411927,Ramen
Konjiki Ramen,"Oh Toronto...after all this hype about a Michelin rated restaurant coming to our home city, I had to check out what the hype was all about.  I checked in on a Saturday a couple weeks after the soft opening and it was not surprisingly, quite busy.  There were people piled out the door in the waiting area.  The organization in terms of getting people's names to the list was quite poor. Nobody knew what was going on so you had some keeners who went up to try to get ahead and were told to wait back and then you had some confused jo's who were looking around to see what to do.   Turns out, they take in some names and when more people leave and those names get seats, there's a girl who goes back to take more names.  So you just have to wait until they come to take your name.  So don't bother being that annoying person who pushes everyone out of the way to get ahead in the name list.The other interesting thing about this restaurant is that it's shared with a Japanese cafe that sells desserts and lattes.  I'm not sure if they're owned by the same person but it was a bit silly because there were SO many people waiting for ramen, that they couldn't help but wait in the cafe area and then were told that they couldn't just stand or sit around there b/c it's for customers of the cafe.  I was that ""avocado on toast"" millennial who then proceeded to buy a latte and a green tea brownie and sat there sipping on drink as slow as possible - for an hour, which is how long it took us to wait.  Now for the food itself!  We ordered the clam broth ramen, the clam soy-sauced based ramen, and the smokey tonkotsu ramen.  Overall, the clam broth ramen was totally a different take than those strong, heavy ramens that you traditionally taste (the bone broth ones).  It was light in flavour and there was definitely a hint of truffle.  I can see why, if one is used to the heavy ramens, why they couldn't appreciate this broth more.  However, I really quite enjoyed it.  The soy-sauced clam broth one was not as good, however, because the soy sauce was too overpowering.  The smokey tonkosu ramen is what a lot of people who complained should have gotten because it was that heavy, BAM, umame ramen that Torontonians are used to.  And I quite enjoyed that one too. We also ordered the obligatory karaage...delicious but quite expensive for the 4 pieces you got. Overall, this place is worth visiting again!",3.0,4.0,125,2018-01-17,43.767033,-79.411927,Ramen

Pork belly was good but meat could've been made slightly more tender (it was tender, just it could be MORE tender). Overall, I enjoyed the ramen noodles and broth but the portion size was not adequate. For value and taste, I'd rather go to Kenzo Ramen.

Konjiki Ramen,"Location/ServiceRight on Yonge street near The Keg and Jack Astor's. There's street parking directly on Yonge and along the side streets, lot parking is also available nearby. Inside has a modern bright decor. Unlike other ramen places, it's very spacious but still limited seats (around 30 seats or so). Note there is a Saryo Cafe inside the restaurant, which you can order drinks and dessert as well. Staff were friendly and quick with orders. The owner talked to us for a little bit, friendly person and approachable. FoodOrdered their signature shoyu ramen, which is a soy sauce based with a clam broth. This place stands out from other place for their clam broth. It was my first time trying it and I like how it's fresh and light. You can taste the clam in the soup. The noodles (I heard were hand made) are very nice to taste and cooked to the right level. The pork (chasu) however was a little tough and dry. They may have used a thinner part cause there's no fat (whereas other places will be soft and chewy). The ramen does not come with an egg. I added it in for $1.50 and it was not as soft boiled as I thought. Small parts of the yolk were fully cooked, but I think this could be an easy thing to fix. My friends ordered the shio signature ramen, which had a heavier tasting of the clam broth compared to shoyu. Although it's a little saltier, but I would recommend it. Also order chicken karrage. Pretty standard as other places, crispy skin and soft meat. Not dry at all and it complimented well with the wasabi mayo. Overall my experience here was good, but not great. The hype makes the waiting time (45min to 1hr) a little turned on, recommend to come on less busy hours. Price wise I thought was a little high, perhaps cause it's Michelin guided.

Konjiki Ramen,"Konjiki Ramen comes from Japan and is Michelin-recommended for their ramen and clam-based soup base. We waited in line for a total of exactly one hour from 12:20 to 1:20 p.m.There was a long hallway into KR which also shared the space with a Japanese dessert cafe, Saryo Tokyo Cafe & Dessert.  I wish KR organized their line-ups better and in an organized fashion.  The entrance to both the ramen restaurant and dessert cafe had a small vestibule between the main door and the second door (probably used to keep out the wind) where people were waiting in line before we could actually go into the restaurant to join the line-up. As it was a cold day, we were told by a staff member who kept coming up to the door to tell us to keep the second door closed. However, this meant that it was unclear on who was actually ""next"" in line for those standing in that little vestibule because once the second door opened, we tried to enter through the door if there was space to get in line for the ramen.  However, it didn't help that it was lunch time and a certain patron was cranky about people ""butting"" in front of her. It certainly didn't give off a very good impression of the line-up process at KR.When we finally got past the awkward waiting part of the vestibule and were actually in the line, we heard the hostess calling out names for parties to be seated. We heard ""Jon for 2!"" or ""Ann for 3!"" and I felt immediately anxious because we hadn't given our names or given a place in the line at all.  We had been waiting all along though. What if other people had gone in front of us to get their name in the list and we weren't on it because we were just simply waiting in the line?  Thus I walked up to the front of the line to inquire. The people who were at the front of the line informed me that I had to put my name down with the hostess who was carrying the clipboard.  Okay... so how come no one told us that then? So I walked over to the female hostess who was holding a clipboard to ask her about putting my name in the list.  She wasn't very pleasant because she sternly told me to return to the line and that she'd approach me about putting my name down on the list once she got to me. Again, it didn't make for a polite nor good first impression of the restaurant.We continued waiting in line. It took another couple of minutes before we saw the hostess finally asking people in front of us and down the line what their names were and putting their party numbers down. Finally! Finally we were put in place on the list (and given a menu to look at while we continued waiting in line). Why couldn't she have done that sooner to ease the frustration from waiting in a line that could easily have been misconstrued by the hoards of people waiting around? They definitely should organize their line-ups better.Like I said, it took us a full hour of waiting before we were called in for a seat.  We got a table near the wall in the middle of the room. I was surprised that the seating wasn't cramped inside.  I liked the decor.Our bowls of ramen came out surprisingly fast! I found that the staff were overly nice and friendly.I got the Mild Shio Signature Clam Broth Ramen which had sous-vide chashu (pork), porcini mushroom sauce, white truffle oil, diced arugala, pea shoot, basil and red onion, braised bamboo shoot, leek, and pancetta to garnish.  I appreciated that the menu actually taught us how to enjoy the clam broth ramen in four steps.  I really liked the signature clam broth! It was so light and refreshing.  It was so much lighter than any other ramen broth I've had before (since those are usually made with pork instead).  Upon nearing the bottom of the bowl, I definitely tasted the saltiness/ocean feel of the clams too.  Since the soup was made with clams, it was also not fatty at all (also a rarity among most ramen broths)!I liked the ramen!  They were fine and grainier than most ramen noodles and tasted very light and fresh. The sous-vide chashu was very thin in texture and smooth.  It wasn't heavy either.  I liked the bowl overall and the portion was just enough for me.The Vegetarian Ramen included the house-made creamy potato soy milk soup base with roasted corn, yams, pickled beets, tofu nuggets, mushroom, spinach, and olive oil.  The ingredients made it a really colourful bowl and the white soup base definitely stood out against the veggies. I liked the soup base as it was so creamy and milky. It was actually even more flavourful than my Shio broth.  I tried the pickled beet too and it was hard in texture but very sour and indeed pickled. The tofu nugget was mushy and tiny. I liked KR overall and the quality of the ramen and soup bases.  I would definitely want to return and try their other bowls. I just hope that next time I won't have to line up for an hour and that they have an improved organized way of getting their guests in a logical line-up.",3.0,4.0,125,2018-01-25,43.767033,-79.411927,Ramen
Konjiki Ramen,"The Michelin Recommended Ramen Shop is finally here in Toronto!! Came here last Wednesday in the freezing cold but felt it was totally worth it.  Arrived around 540 so only needed to wait 15 minutes to be seated.  My friend and I both went with the Shoyu Signature Ramen (~$14) with an egg added.  Their Signature Ramen are all clam base, so if you are allergic to seafood, you probably want to try other ramen.Portion was decent, although only three pieces of Chasu (very normal for ramen shops), they were at least delicious and not dry.  Ramen wise, they don't use the typical yellow noodles you have at ramen places, instead their noodle is more soba like and I though it went quite well with the flavour and the texture was great too.  Soup base was also not too salty, so the overall ramen was perfect for me!We also ordered a Chicken Karaage and the Karaage was pretty big.  $5 for 4 chicken Karaage is a little more expensive than I expected, but at least the chicken was juicy and it wasn't over fried.I will for sure be returning to try other ramen and appetizers!  O and yes I need to leave some room for desserts next time too!!4 stars for now.  Seating wasn't the greatest, a little pricier than their competitors and it's cash only as of now.",3.0,4.0,125,2018-01-02,43.767033,-79.411927,Ramen
Konjiki Ramen,"Total wait time to get a table for us, was just under 1 hour.  According to Google wait time was only supposed to be less than 15 minutes.  So NEVER trust Google for wait time estimates.  But to speed things up, they hand you the menu while you are in line so you can order right away when you are seated.  From ordering to getting the food, it was SUPER fast.  The hubby took off his jacket, and went to the washroom, and our ramen arrived at the table before he even came back! We ordered their signature clam broth shio ramen, original shoyu tonkotsu ramen, and a side of braised pork belly.  Starting off with the broths.  Both the clam broth, and the tonkotsu broths are VERY different from any of the other ramen houses in Toronto.  The clam broth, very light and clear, strong truffle and clam flavours.  Nothing like I've ever tasted in a ramen broth before.  Delicious.  The tonkotsu broth, exact opposite of the clam broth, beautiful creamy pork broth that coats your mouth and doesn't seem to go away.  While being creamy, it didn't feel heavy.  I know it's a sign of respect and that you enjoyed your meal by finishing your broth.  Usually I don't.  But this time, I drank it all down!Noodles, also different than the ramen houses in Toronto.  The only other time I've had ramen noodles like this was in North America was in New York City at Mr. Taka Ramen (sister restaurant to Bigiya in Tokyo which is also on Michelin's Bib Gourmand list).  The noodles are thinner, more al dente, and I would say more similar to a pasta than the ramen noodles that i'm used to eating.All of their meats are done sous vide.  While the meat was tender, it felt a bit dry.  I assume because the chashu was made with a leaner cut of pork.  There was a thin strip of fat, but other than that, the chashu was very lean.  The pork belly, had some strips of fat running through it, and it was definitely a bit more juicy than the chashu, but there was a bit of gristle so some bites were a bit chewier.  I guess I'm just not a fan of the sous vide method.  The braised pork belly also came with an egg.  Presentation of the egg was flat out horrible looking.  I can't figure out how they cut it to look the way it did.  And it was also missing chunks of white too.  Usually when you can't peel the shell away from a boiled egg properly, either they did it too hot, or the egg wasn't fresh.",3.0,4.0,125,2018-01-25,43.767033,-79.411927,Ramen
Konjiki Ramen,"I came here with my friend at around 5PM today and it took us approximately 40 minutes to get seated. We were seated at the island booth, which was kind of uncomfortable considering we didn't have any place to hang our coats, but the lighting was great at least...!I got the shio ramen while my friend got the tonkotsu shoyu ramen. If you're a fan of the traditional, savory and salty cream broth I'd go with the tonkotsu. If you're feeling adventurous and want to try a new taste to ramen (in this particular case, a clam flavor) then you should definitely try the shio. I thought the portions were great, the noodles were firm and chewy and the toppings complimented the dish. I'm a bit confused about all of the low ratings! We also ordered the chicken karaage, however we were told it wasn't made because the order didn't go through. When we checked up on it, they told us right away that they were making it and we got it five minutes later. The chicken was very flavorful and tender!Overall service was great and the servers were very friendly. I would definitely come back here again!Some tips i would like to give:- THEY ACCEPT DEBIT AND CREDIT CARDS! Ignore all the other tips that say otherwise. They recently got a machine three days ago, which also accepts Apple Pay- The Mayo in the chicken Karaage has wasabi in it!

Konjiki Ramen,"Wow! This is probably the best ramen I had outside of Japan. I arrived at 5:50 and waited a good 30min before being seated at the stools. On the menu were 5-7 different ramen selections and a few appetizers. I ordered the spicy ramen, karage and the Goyza. The appetizers were nothing special, the dipping sauce for the karage was actually disappointing. But the ramen! Oh the ramen was SO GOOD! The spicy ramen was so creamy and savoury. It was so good I had to drink all the soup, leaving any would be a waste.

Prices here are relatively more expensive (on average $14 for a bowl of ramen) but the broths are rich and flavourful.For the two of us, we ordered the signature clam broth ramen (shoyu) and the smoky black tonkotsu ramen. Both were delicious!

Konjiki Ramen,"The rating is purely based on the food. I'd give it a 4, but this place is so hyped up and my expectations for the food were that much higher. I was literally expecting to be mind-blown, or to have a foodgasm or something and can't wait to order a second bowl or come back next time. But none of that occurred. The food is not bad, but...did not satisfy the expectations I had placed on it. I would even consider giving it a 2 simply because it did not meet expectations.The restaurant has capacity for maybe 30 people. They've got bar seats down the middle and tables along the sides. There are boxes containing utensils and cups holding napkins. Self-service, never have to wait if you drop your chopsticks on the floor.Service is overall pretty good. To me anyways. Waitresses walk around and check up on you for water re-fills. They only accepted cash at this point during the soft opening because presumably they didn't have a machine set up, and sometimes they got the change wrong which may be quite a problem but they apologize without contesting your claim.Washrooms have an accessible sign, but for some reason they do not have an automatic door installed. However, the men/women signs do have braille under them. I just found these details to be quite curious.The menu is pretty simple, and on the back they've stuck on a couple drinks. Soft-opening, so I guess this is to be expected. UNLESS, that is meant to give a more of authentic feel?I ordered the signature clam based broth with shoyu. When it arrived, my first impression was it's a pretty bare bowl of noodle soup. My fault cause I didn't add any extra toppings, but even then, you were presented with 3 pieces of chashu and a couple pieces of bamboo along with some garnish.The noodles were nice and chewy. They had flavor as well. The amount of noodles you get relative to the size of the bowl is not bad either, but for the most part if you don't add extra toppings, it's pretty much just a bowl of noodles if you don't pace yourself.The broth contained what I presume is truffle oil (I don't usually dine at places that offer truffles), and the flavor really stood out for me. I did not enjoy it with soy sauce as much: it reminded me so much of the wonton soup that I would get from chinese places in chinatown. The broth also did not come hot; no steam or anything, so you don't have to worry about taking time with your pictures since it's not hot anyways.I enjoyed the chashu. At other ramen places in toronto, the chashu I've had is usually well-cooked (or over-cooked). This one had an enjoyable texture to it given how thin it is and how long it had been cooked. Flavor was good. Nice to chew on. Would be nice if it was a bit bigger, but you'll never be satisfied with the size for what you're paying I suppose so you'll just have to settle with what you have or ask for extra chashu.Despite the size of the bowl, it was surprising satisfying as I wasn't on the hunt for something else to eat afterwards.Also ordered a plate of chicken karaage. For $5, you got 4 small pieces of chicken. The chicken was tender and juicy, but it's about the same as all the other ramen places (that offer more chicken, or offer them for cheaper). Well, this place does have the brand so I guess a premium price is to be expected.Eh...hard to say. Wouldn't line up 30-40 minutes for it. It's not bad, but with all the other ramen places in the area, I don't think they've got that much of a competitive advantage beyond the brand since the portions are smaller, prices are higher, and wait times can be absurd. But who knows, perhaps I am used to commoner food and cannot fully appreciate this particular bowl of ramen as the michelin judges have.",3.0,2.0,125,2017-12-20,43.767033,-79.411927,Ramen
Konjiki Ramen,"Not exactly living up to the hype for me considering that it's a Michelin star ramen restaurant from Japan, and the founder/head chef is cooking in the kitchen during its soft opening period.Environment:Pretty much steps from the North York Centre subway station, so the restaurant is pretty easily accessible by commuters. Walking in the restaurant, they have a dessert section near the entrance, which is a collaboration with another restaurant that sells many Japanese matcha desserts. The ramen restaurant itself is ok size with some single tables on the sides, and a big communal bar table in the middle with uncomfortable bar stools. It is recommended that you come in a group of 4 of fewer to minimize the wait time, and I think the largest group size they can accommodate right now is 6.Food:The ramens average $13-14 for the soft opening menu, desserts about $5-7, and sides about $5. I got the Shio Ramen ($14) with Chicken Karaage ($5) on the side. The Chicken Karaage came first and my goodness the portion was tiny, that it was 4 pieces of chicken about the same size as chicken nuggets. Taste wise it was so average as well, nothing stood out, which totally didn't justify the high price. The Shio Ramen broth had an interesting flavour: the soup was pretty light but had a sweet taste with a hint of bitterness due to the clamp. Not exactly my cup of tea considering that I prefer my soup creamy. Other than that the ramen was very lackluster and the portion was small. It only contained noodles, 3 slices of Chashu, and a few pieces of bamboo shoot. So basically what I was paying for was the brand name, because certainly, the ingredients didn't cost very much. Service:Since the restaurant opened not too long ago, many people were eager to try it, so the line was pretty long even though I came on a Wednesday night. We waited for about 30 mins for a table for 4, but the waiter was quite nice at updating us the status of the tables and offered to split our group up if we wanted to be seated faster. During the actual dining experience, the waiter would periodically come to refill our water. Since this was their soft opening period they didn't have any machines set up so it was cash only. They just so happened to mess up my change and gave me $4 short, which I definitely wasn't too thrilled aboutOverall, I guess the ramen was alright, but it was too plain and too light for my taste, and I quite lacked the toppings. Personally, I would much prefer going to Sansotei and Santouka, which have more food at or below the price, so I don't see myself coming again.",3.0,3.0,125,2017-12-22,43.767033,-79.411927,Ramen
Konjiki Ramen,"My feelings are a bit mixed on this review as I do want to like this place. While there was a lot of hype for this place , I can't help but feel a bit disappointed. I sat on the fence for writing a review, as they are still in their ""soft opening"" phase, so things will be hit and miss.When I went, we ordered the signature clam ramen, smoked ramen, karaage and tofu nuggets.We were never asked if we would like to drink anything, and we had to chase someone down to get water at the end of our meal. Yup, no one came by to get us water. We were not dying of thirst, but only got thirsty after eating. Would have been nice to have water already on hand.Honestly the sides were very underwhelming. The tofu nuggets are nothing special, except for being a bit pricer then other places. The karaage had a tad too much burnt bits, and it was more ""batter with chicken"" then ""chicken with batter"". I honestly can't recommend the sides at all.The clam broth was very aromatic, and tasty. The meat that comes with it is made ""sous vide"" style (that's the fancy way where they cook the meat in boiling water in a bag). It was definitely different from the usual charred bbq version most places serve.I'm sitting on the fence with whether I liked the smoke ramen. When you first taste it, it's a very nice taste. But towards the end of the meal, you start to realize it's pretty much liquid smoke flavoring that was added in to give it that smoky flavor. What I'm trying to say is that the smoke flavor tasted very artificial. Though the actual ramen noodles were probably the best I have had in Toronto. Thin, yet they were still very nice and firm, with a nice bounce to the bite (al dante). Again since it's only a soft opening, I expect that there will be a lot of bugs, and I would be happy to update this review once I have the chance to come back a few times.But for what I experienced, there is definitely room for improvement to go from good to great, but I was not wowed.",3.0,3.0,125,2017-12-17,43.767033,-79.411927,Ramen
Konjiki Ramen,"Came here yesterday for lunch and was a bit hesitant. After reading some of the Yelp reviews, I was worried that the ramen would fall flat and be substantially below standard.We came early at roughly 11:20am and just missed the crowd. People started to steadily trickle in at around 11:25am, and soon enough, a line began forming. The customer service was excellent; the servers were very friendly, and kept apologizing profusely for the wait (they had let the crowd in from the cold earlier than before the restaurant opened). One waitress even said, ""Sorry, but please hold on a little longer. The restaurant actually opens at 11:30am"".The four of us ordered two creamy tonkotsu ramen and two shio signature clam broth ramen. The place doesn't offer green tea, as it costs an additional $1 for the tea, so we only got hot water to drink. The tonkotsu broth was so white and creamy!! It was delicious and so sinfully great. My sister didn't like the addition of the pickled vegetables and ginger though, as she said it took away from the richness and creaminess of the broth. My mom added an egg to hers, and it was perfectly made.My dad and I ordered the shio clam broth. For those who enjoy the purity of flavours (like me), I would recommend not mixing in everything and just enjoying the simple flavours of the broth before digging in. Once you mix everything together, the flavour of the truffle oil becomes overwhelming and slightly overpowers the sweetness of the clam and chicken broth. It becomes slightly too much and overpowering. That said, I still thoroughly enjoyed the ramen and rate it very highly. The char siu is also very lean and smooth - it is unlike the fatty pork belly of certain ramen places like Kinton, but delicious in its own way.The portions are, however, quite small. My ramen only had three thin pieces of char siu and some bamboo shoots. The noodle portion is just enough to satisfy you.",3.0,5.0,125,2017-12-24,43.767033,-79.411927,Ramen
Konjiki Ramen,"Sansotei or Konjiki?: For me, these are the two best ramen joints in the area, and I say pay the extra few dollars for Konjiki.The Order: Signature Shoyu RamenRoasted Garlic RamenChicken KaraagePork Belly Don (rice)The Reason:Having Tried both Roasted Garlic Ramens at Sansotei and Konjiki, I can say that I liked Konjiki's roasted flavor more, but I liked the base broth more at Sansotei.However, I really suggest not ordering this, and go for the Signature clam/chicken/pork broth. It is great!. Best tasting broth I've tasted in all of Toronto, and I easily cleaned my bowl completely.Konjiki's bowls are also deceptively large, as it holds more than you'd think.I was starving waiting in line for 30mins, and planned to order extra noodles if I could, but never ended up needing to. I was quite full even before getting to my rice and Karaage.The Karaage and Pork Belly Don are also very good, but honestly don't compare to the ram8en. The pork belly don did have a nice unique ginger taste to it though. I'd rather just order two Signature Ramens next time!Conclusion: Definitely my preferred ramen place as parking is convenient, but until the hype dies down, I'd be okay with eating Sansotei for my next craving til I can make this place a regular without the 30min waits for seating.Also noticing im getting thirstier by the second I write this review, so don't forget to drink lots of water!",3.0,4.0,125,2017-12-30,43.767033,-79.411927,Ramen
Gyubee,"*Important: I don't eat meat only seafood, meat reviews will be from other person that joined me*Came here for my friends birthday, the staff was very very welcoming and the seating is cozy and modern. It's a great place to chow down with a group of friends or to have an evening bbq with a friend. It was all you can eat and the waiter was kind enough to suggest what we order and she explained the menu. I personally loved the sweet potatoes (highlyrecommended), enoki mushrooms, zucchini and the seafood. The food paired well with the sauce given to you. I also tried the bimbimbap without egg, it was a small portion but the sauce made it delicious.My friend that ate majority of the meat enjoyed the variety offered, you might have to order a bit of everything to know which meats you prefer. The meats were sliced thin enough to cook quickly. The staff was also super excited to sing happy birthday and bring out a candle for my friend, I found it to be super sweet.I would have liked if there was tofu to grill or more seafood optionsLastly, dessert creme brûlée was small but delicious and the melona bars were good too!",4.0,4.0,32,2018-01-24,43.66696,-79.400872,"Barbeque , Japanese"
Gyubee,"I've been to Gyubee twice for dinner (last December & this January).First visit, my friends & I agreed to order most of the menu, but kind of regretted ordering all of the vegetables. I don't recommend trying grilled asparagus, white mushrooms and zucchini only because I prefer more flavour. When you do order, I suggest 3-4 pieces for the seafood, and 4-8 pieces for the meat per person* ..first visit I had small pieces of meat for the first round, then the second round the pieces were bigger which surprised me. Second visit, they gave more than what was ordered for just 2 people so we only had one round.My favourite meat was all of the beef (minus the beef tongue). Can you say, beef bacon because that's basically what it is! One bowl of steamed rice is plenty for me only because there was also lettuce that you can wrap the meat in. AYCE bibimbap is a bonus if you love spicy. The creme brûlée is small, but still good. Melona Bar is a great way to end the meal & cool off from grilling your food haha. It's only one bar per person & don't forget to ask what are the flavours (I love coconut and melon).As for drinks, I tried the peach mojito without alcohol which is $5 (extra $2 if you want alcohol with it) & it was really good! There is also free refills for $3 soda drinks. So far this location doesn't take reservations so it is just walk in. First time I only waited 10 min on a Friday, second time I had to wait half an hour on a Thursday. Overall the service was good, no complaints both times.

Gyubee,"If it wasn't for the price and long wait time, I would honestly be preaching this place as a 5/5 find. After experimenting with Gyu-Kaku and other BBQ joints in downtown and around Finch, Gyubee has won my heart.  I have never devoured so much meat in one sitting! The secret? The house marinated kalbi short ribs. They are a gastric journey that requires multiple return trips!Frankly speaking, all the meats are show stoppers, as my friends and I had different favourites that night.  We couldn't find a  meat we didn't like. Fortunately, what's great is that they can start you off with a serving of all the meats for you to try.  Plus, the staff members are extremely attentive, friendly, and generous with the rounds of orders. We were seated for two hours and probably did 8-10 rounds of orders! This is a saving grace because, when I'm at other BBQ joints, I often get a warning for the last call by the 4th round of orders. Additionally, I was never a fan of BBQ-ing my veggies, but Gyubee has mastered this. When you order some of their vegetable varieties, they are buttered and served in foil tin cups. Don't put the veggies directly on the grill and instead heat the entire tin on the grill. After a few minutes, you'll have a buttery and juicy vegetable side dish! The enoki mushrooms were slammin' in this regard! We did 5+ orders of them and fought for them! Seriously, order them during your next visit and leave dreaming about them in your sleep. Now, after all the gouging, you'll get to finish off with a surprisingly delicious assortment of desserts. For an AYCE menu, the creme brulee was a creamy, caramel heaven! My friend couldn't stop at 5 orders! Also, everyone is given a Melona bar with their bill for a refreshing zing to end their meal. They've really upped the ante from the usual mint/guava candy you get with your bill, really.So everyone, get your tongs out and prepare to have that food baby because Gyubee should be on your next meat trip!",4.0,4.0,32,2018-01-02,43.66696,-79.400872,"Barbeque , Japanese"
Gyubee,"Gyubee is a great place for affordable Japanese BBQ. So far in downtown, there aren't many truly great options so the entrance of Gyubee is highly welcomed! The service both times I've been was great. Lots of waitresses attending to customers and taking down orders. Food was also pretty good and came very quickly. The store is well decorated and comfy with its booth style seating. Dinner is priced at $27.99/person.NOTE: They only take reservations for groups 5+. Also, If you're going with a big group of friends, try reserving / asking for the larger tables with 2 grills.I have been to the location twice - when I went as a group of 6 friends, we had to squeeze in and share ONE grill which made it really inconvenient and not as enjoyable of a dining experience as it could've been. When I went as a couple, it was a much better set up.In terms of food, there is a decent variety of beef (kalbi, tongue, miso beef) as well as pork (belly, cheek) and chicken. Seafood options included squid and shrimp.The meats are well marinated - my favourite are the two types of kalbi. I think I've had better meat at other Japanese BBQ restaurants, however they were not AYCE and were quite expensive. For the price, I really can't complain about Gyubee's offerings. There are also a number of vegetables to compliment the meat (enoki mushrooms in garlic butter is great!) Appetizers include kimchi and bean sprout - which are good as palette cleansers. They also offer mini versions of Korean bibimbap and cold noodles which is nice so you don't have to get a full meal.Overall, I know I'll definitely be back. The seating is booth style and it's a great place to share a meal with friends. There is a two hour policy in place which is fair but just make sure you get a table with more than 1 grill if there are more than 4 of you going.",4.0,4.0,32,2017-11-28,43.66696,-79.400872,"Barbeque , Japanese"
Gyubee,"This second location opened up after the Markham one has been opened for a period of time.No reservations on a weekend - you have to line up. Needless to say, took us about 40 mins before we got our table. I haven't been to the Markham branch to compare the two, but I really enjoyed my experience at this location. It's newly opened, and the building is under renovation right now since it's relatively old. Right next to UTS, I can see this location becoming busy with a lot of younger customers. There's a lot of different selections for the AYCE menu. NOrmal price on a weekend is 32.99 but grand opening therefore they lowered prices to 29.99. I feel that i would come here on a special occasion, but it won't be my regular joint (or else i need bigger pants lol). I tried almost all of their ""meats"" on the menu, as well as some of the sides:Sides:Edemame, your typical order, nothing special.They ran out of cabbage salad, so they served house salad instead, with the sauce, pretty good.Bibambap - i love this option, great pairing with the meats, and it comes with the kimchi and a fried egg!Drink:i ordered the lychee mojito and it was quite delicious!Beef:My first most favourite... Miso Beef Brisket. I think i ordered this dish like 4 times. Their sauce is ADDICTIVE. I don't know what's in it, but after trying it the first time, that's all I wanted to keep getting... the miso sauce does the trick - they have regular beef brisket too, which is just as good in terms of the cut of beef.. but in the end i dipped all my regular beef brisket into the miso sauce that's leftover :)House marinated kalbi short rib is my 2nd favourte. LOVE the flavours. I kept ordering this too :)The rest of them..... beef tongue, black pepper kalbi and the kalbi bonless short rib.. they were all very nicely marinated and flavoured, so in general I would say start off with trying all 6 of them and then decide which ones you want to keep eating :)Pork:Both pork belly and pork cheek were delicious! the seasoning isn't as bold but the textures of both were great! I re-ordered these as well.chicken thigh - with the 2 hour seating limit, we felt limited to order this... but the seasoning is great on the chicken and we did end up ordering it twice, but it does take longer to cook.shrimp - your usual grilled shrimp - nothing special. I dind't try the squid since rest of my table didn't want to eat it lol.Veg:zucchini - great for grilling and taking a break from the meatsmushrooms - they have enoki and king oyster. both were great, but the added bonus of the enoki is it comes in a foil pouch with some freshly grated garlic and butter... and the result is heavenly :) we ended up ordering 4 more of these pouches!Dessert:creme brulee - bite sized, and it's AYCE so you can have as many as you want... but for a bite size dessert, this creme brulee is quite flavourful and creamy... I did have more than one :)Melona - it's only 1 per customer... and you get to choose between melon and strawberry. I did not like the strawberry lol... but I loved the melon one :)All in all i felt the meat was quite well prepared, seasoned, and marinated. The staff did change our grills often when the fire start flaring up from the oils stuck on the grate. They ddin't rush us at the 2 hours, so all in all I feel i had a positive experience. At this price point.. it would be like any other AYCE place.. i would come here for a special occasion, but otherwise I don't think I will eat my money's worth, unless I grow into bigger pants :)(FYI because they just opened 2 weeks ago, they don't have credit payment yet... only cash and debit, but they are working on getting credit card payment available soon)",4.0,5.0,32,2017-11-07,43.66696,-79.400872,"Barbeque , Japanese"
Gyubee,"5 out of 5!!I love it here. For those of you who love AYCE Korean bbq, you'll definitely love the Japanese AYCE bbq. + The grill you cook with is different than the Korean bbq grill and I actually prefer it. It looks like a net and it allows the flame to cook the food faster. You can ask to switch it out whenever you want!+ Portion sizes are small but it's AYCE so you can order as much as you like - if you know you are super hungry and want a lot of something, order a lot of it at once to avoid waiting+ Ordering works by just calling over a server and telling them what you want - they have iPads that they input these into for the orders+ The miso beef is amazinggggggg~+ The buttered enoki mushroom is too die for - my friends and I ordered this multiple times. It comes in a foil container which you put directly onto the grill to cook the mushrooms to avoid them getting burnt. HIGHLY recommend!+ Their mojito drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic) are quite yummy and flavourful - be sure to ask for less ice before you order because they put a lot + They have this red pepper spice that is straight up addicting. I kept adding it to everything I ate. I dipped my food into soy sauce and then the spice+ The Crema brûlée is some of the best I've tasted from an AYCE bbq place - very creamy + They serve Melona bars as the ice cream dessert - flavours vary by day + Service is EXCELLENT**15% service charge (tip) automatically applied for parties of 5 people or over.Overall a great place and I'm a huge fan!",4.0,5.0,32,2017-12-22,43.66696,-79.400872,"Barbeque , Japanese"
Gyubee,"The location looked small but surprisingly was much more spacious than I thought. There is a back section after the kitchen that seats the bigger groups. This place takes cash and debit only. The portions were reasonable based on the number of orders you make for each item. The beef brisket, pork belly and kalbi definitely were my favourite. The chicken thigh and shrimp is good for the first round of ordering but you can do without it. I surprisingly enjoyed the cabbage salad which had a nice sesame dressing and the cold tofu (it was sweet and savoury). What caught me by surprised is the seasoning they have for you to dip with the sweet soy sauce. It had a smokey curry flavour almost that you would get with the skewered lamb at pacific mall. It was nice that you end your meal with a Melona bar. When we went they had coconut and mango flavours. Of course we got one of each. Currently it is holiday pricing so we paid $21.99 for lunch. Overall it was a good experience, they were fast with bringing out our orders and cleaning up empty dishes. I'd come here again to dine.",4.0,5.0,32,2017-12-14,43.66696,-79.400872,"Barbeque , Japanese"
Gyubee,"Great service from the whole team!Very quick, always filled our water, helped us out (first timers).The server suggested for our first time a sampler platter they had. We got a little bit of every meat and veggie they had on the dinner menu. We dedicated not to try the appetizers. After that, we selected a few of the ones we liked best. That included the miso beef, marinated ribs, enoki mushrooms, and buttery sweet potato. (we also enjoyed the garlic spinach and brisket but ran out of room). We were a little confused with the veggies in metal foil, but once we got it, we loved it all!! Brilliant. It's a great addition to just plain grilled veggies. The sauce and seasoning on the table were both tasty. The sauce which looked like soy sauce had a very light/mild flavour which was not too salty. It tasted a bit like cooking wine. The red seasoning was a blend of spices that I think included paprika and Cajun.I WAS SO EXCITED FOR THE CRÈME BRULE AND WOW IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!! IT WAS SO CREAMY. The top was still sugary grains but still had the classic crunchy top. We did have to wait 5-10 mins for it as they ran out. We also ate melona, they had coconut and mango.The grill which is like a fine metal net is different from the cast iron grill at kbbq.Note: the first time I walked in, we were turned away as there was already a long line and they said they weren't taking any more people because the line had to clear and the people in line needed time to eat. We came 1.5hrs before closing on a Friday. When we came on Wednesday at 6pm, we were told the wait was 45 mins. The venue is surprisingly big.One star lost because some of the beef cuts had zero taste and were a little tough. The chicken was also not very unique or special. The spare ribs didn't have any bones though!",4.0,4.0,32,2017-12-15,43.66696,-79.400872,"Barbeque , Japanese"
Gyubee,"We came at around 6 pm on a Friday night and waited for 30 minutes before getting seated. The restaurant is super packed and the lineup stretches on for a while so you should consider coming here before 7 pm really. Most of the customers are students but I'm sure it's family friendly as well!The menu is really quite diverse and yummy so you can't really go wrong with the dishes. I do recommend the beef dishes more though and it's up to 10 pieces of meat per person for each dish. The desserts were pretty good too, you can have as much créme brûlée as you'd like but it's 1 melona bar per person. Of course it's a pretty new restaurant so the service can be hit and miss at times. The staff was really nice but they messed up our orders a few times (gave us the wrong meat, gave us extra desserts, etc) which I'm sure they'll smooth out within the next few weeks.

Gyubee,"The food is good but the service is slow. 15% taxes is mandatory. Cash or debit payment only. The food is good and comparable to their location on Woodbine but I'd say service is much slower than their original location even when I came here for lunch on a relatively slower when not all tables were taken. The best are the house marinated kalbi, sausage and shrimp. What really annoyed me is that their gratuity is added post-tax and it does not say on your bill but they tell you verbally that they add 15% on top of the bill. I think gratuity should be based on level of service and if I didn't think that the service warranted a 15% post-tax (which is technically 18% pre-tax) gratuity, then it should be my option to pay what I think the service deserved. I think the fact that this is not specified on their bill is also quite dishonest.",4.0,3.0,32,2018-01-01,43.66696,-79.400872,"Barbeque , Japanese"
Gyubee,"Pro: Excellent service, food comes quickly, amazing desserts, great varietyCon: meat a little too fattyWhat a great location! Right outside of U of T campus, this restaurant choose the right place to open. All my friends have been raving about this place so I thought I would go and treat myself. We arrived at around 6pm on a Thursday night and had to wait for around 10 minutes. Service: I cannot describe in words how impressed I was with the service. The server we had was so attentive and came to take our order as soon as she saw us pick up the menu again. She answered all the questions we had about the items and even gave us recommendations. This is truly impressive for an ayce place.Food: Portions are small so I would recommend getting one of each item for the first round and then order what you like for the second. The meat quality is very decent but it is a little too fatty for my liking. By the end, we felt very heavy from all the grease. The vegetables are very fresh and the inoki mushrooms were seasoned with garlic and butter which was a very nice touch.I need a whole section dedicated to the creme brûlée and rice. Yes you read that right, the rice. Their rice was unbelievably good. I don't know how they cook it but wow it was delicious. Also the creme brûlée is absolutely amazing. It might not look like it but personally I could eat 6 of those. These two things are a must get! Overall, this is a wonderful restaurant that serves some of the best bbq in town.

Gyubee,"A welcome surprise on a cold winters day - each table has a hot grill to warm up with! Food was quite good - a selection of meats/veggies/seafood to grill up - and it's all you can eat (AYCE) I had a hard time telling apart the various beef dishes because the servers didn't outline them to us when they arrived, and would have liked some more dipping/marinade sauces. Would recommend getting a a small amount of a whole bunch of things if it's your first time there, and then order more of what you like the second time round. Decor is lovely too - very modern, understated Japanese detailing. Will definitely visit again when I'm in TO.",4.0,4.0,32,2018-01-03,43.66696,-79.400872,"Barbeque , Japanese"

Gyubee,Amazing experience!I loved everything about this place. The only thing I can complain about is that they don't take reservations. Meat quality is excellent and the marinades are super flavourful without overpowering the meat itself. I love the sides that are available as well - the coleslaw is my favourite! Even the creme brulee was surprisingly velvety and creamy.I really believe this is the best Japanese BBQ place in Toronto period.

Gyubee,"I have been here for a few times already. A great place to have meat feasts. Comparing to other AYCE BBQs, this one is more pricey.They have a wide selection of appetizers, beef, pork, chicken and vegetables. Also, it has Korean Bibimbap and cold noodles!!  I personally love their cold noodles, the texture is chewy and the soup is flavorful. Recommend to try beef short ribs, beef brisket and pork cheek. They used to have salmon sashimi as well, but now it has been taken off the menu. Cost for 2 people is approximately $100 if you will be ordering drinks, if not, then it's about $80 dollars. Best part about this restaurant is that you can end your meal with Melona and Creme Brulee !!!! No one shall be leaving without them!",4.0,5.0,32,2018-01-13,43.66696,-79.400872,"Barbeque , Japanese"
Gyubee,"I am almost always weary of all-you-can-eat Asian food... first that's not really a thing in Asia,it's a western concept developed by some amazing food marketer... which makes me wonder how authentic and good the quality of food being served is. THUS FAR, I had not been wrong in my assumption (Korean Grill house I am looking at you), until today.I don't think I ever ate for 4 hours in a row until this day; yes, you can call me a piglet. my brothers will agree.Even though the meat was going to just be grilled they came garnished and in perfect proportion you can try everything more than once. The marinades were excellent and they even offered lettuce (korean bbq includes eating the meat with rice and gochujang in a lettuce wrap) as a side but no gochujang so i just had kimchi with the meat...awesome combo. just foe offering kimchi as a side I would give it an extra star.The service here was fantastic - everyone was actually working ,had everything you might need on hand. They appeared like food angels to adjust fire & change the grill so your food doesn't burn. My tea(extra $1) filled itself constantly. I almost died from the cuteness of the Japanese servers who couldn't stop smilbowing(smiling and side bowing ) anytime she saw us. dirty dishes were never on our table as if we ate nothing at all(this is how 4 hr dinner happened). MOST importantly though, you must try the creme brulee. The portion is small ( so u can squeeze it into your overcapacitated stomach) but I have yet to try a better one outside of fine dining...especially in an AYCE. They actually caramelized it with a torch and no bubbly top - just PERFECT.  if i knew it would be THAT good I would have skipped round 5 for more brulee.after ""a meal"" here I made peace with my inner piglet. I really wishex I had a 2nd, maybe 3rd? what the heck...4 stomachs like cows do. But they probably will go bankrupt if I did. I feel like it was a touch more expensive for an AYCE but totally worth it for thed quality of food and service.THE wss ONLY THING I DON'T GET IS... the menu is LITTERED with Korean food...even the name Gyubee is Korean...why is it called Japanese BBQ(that's not really their thing)?not that  it matters. it could be called ""path to finding your inner piggie"" and I would still go back.",4.0,5.0,32,2017-11-10,43.66696,-79.400872,"Barbeque , Japanese"
The Cheesecake Factory,"The lineups are still quite long. But if you are travelling as a solo or couple one way to beat the line ups is to go straight to the bar and sit at the bar to order your food. They serve the full menu there and will take you right away (no waiting for a buzzer!) as it is first come first served. We got there around 10:30am on a Sunday morning. The lineup to get a buzzer was about 5 minutes, and then the wait for a table for 2 was about 50 minutes. The host offered us the bar seating which was available right away and we decided to go for it. Nobody was seated at the bar when we got there, but it did full up shortly afterwards.The bar seating was not bad and service was immediate since the bartenders are always there. We ordered two brunch items to share. Lemon ricotta pancakes (to die for!) and green chilaquiles with carnitas (chicken) and eggs (also very tasty). Later I noticed others having the fried chicken waffles benedict and had some serious order envy. Next time for sure! Between the two of us we could barely finish our orders. We took home half the pancakes for later. Overall a very satisfying meal. Once we were done we quickly paid for our order and were out by 11:40, probably around the time we would have been getting our seats if we had waited with the buzzer!After walking around the mall, on our way out we stopped at the cheesecake counter and ordered a slice to go. That again took minutes for them to get packed up for us. So while the food is great and portions generous, I don't think it is worth waiting for more that 1 hour for. So I will only go back if the wait is shorter (which is probably going to be a while yet) or go straight to the bar for a seat or just order takeout.",3.0,4.0,149,2018-01-29,43.724775,-79.45538,"Desserts , Burgers , Pizza"
The Cheesecake Factory,"I have iterally been counting down the days until I got to visit this location. I frequent the cheesecake factory anytime I get a chance when I'm in the states so to have one soo much closer to home makes me ecstatic beyond belief. Hubby and I came on a Saturday afternoon just before 3pm and we already had the mindset that the wait would be long. Don't think you can just waltz on into this place and snag a table... there is Always a wait. The line to get the buzzer to alert when your table is ready is usually so long that they split it in half (one half in the centre of the mall and then your guided to another line immediately outside the restaurant entrance to get the buzzer where you have to wait again. Once you receive the buzzer it was a 2 to 2.5hr wait at that point. Your are also restricted to where you can go with the buzzer. I think the jurisdiction is between shoppers drugmart and the bay. If you go outside the area the buzzer won't go off and you will miss your alert. Luckily we were saved by an Angel named Ashley who decided to eat at the bar and gave us her buzzer and she had only 30 mins left to wait. Talk about a score!!! From there we went inside the restaurant to the hostess desk to wait where they collect the buzzers and seat you. We only ended up waiting 15 more minutes and then were seated. The hostess lead us to a cozy table for two at the end of a banquet in the centre row at the back section of the restaurant. Our waitress was soo friendly and upbeat she came over introduced herself and took our drink orders and gave us time to peruse the colossal menu. The menu really has something to please any appetite. I always try to get something different everytime I come. We really had a hard a time deciding what to eat with all the options. The lady at the table beside us had ordered some sort of steak dish and both hubby and I were eying it. I had to ask her what it was and we both ended up ordering it. So onto the foodFor appetizer I knew for sure what I wanted to getAvocado Egg Rolls- Avocado, sun-dried tomato, red onion, and cilantro fried in a crisp wrapper and served with a tamarind cashew dipping sauceFirst of all I love avocados so this was right up my alley! There were huge chunks of creamy avocados in this contrasted in that super crunchy wrapper and dipped in that sweet and tangy tamarind sauce it was just the perfect bite!  For entrees we both ordered the Grilled Steak Medallions -Served with fresh asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, sautéed cherry tomatoes, crusted croutons, mashed potatoes, and Madeira wine sauceOur steaks were cooked perfectly medium rare, well seasoned and tender. They were adorned with a crunchy crouton breadcrumb topping which was something I never had on a steak but I enjoyed the different textures. The mashed potatoes were deliciously buttery in taste and I enjoyed swiping every bite through that delicious wine sauce.  Finally onto dessert. So I never deviate from my dessert choice when visiting the cheesecake factory because basically I'm obsessed with this cake it's just soo good!Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake - Chunks of Reese's peanut butter cups in original cheesecake with layers of delicious fudge cake and caramelJust OMG I love this cake sooo much it would be part of my last meal! If you love peanut butter and chocolate this one is for you! I just adore all the distinct different layers in this cake as it begins with the Reese's cheesecake followed by a layer of caramel studded with crunchy peanuts than that fudgey chocolate cake and then a rich peanut butter layer in the middle then everything repeated again covered in fudge and chocolate curls and topped with a peanut butter swirl It's to die for!! So I have to say overall I had a wonderful experience at Canada's 1st cheesecake factory! I really have to commened the staff here as despite the chaotic crowds, hoards of patrons, and just the crazy business of it all everyone I encountered was happy and cheerful and willing to help. Food came out in a really timely manner, everything was delicious from start to finish, portions are massive here as are the cheesecake slices, and service was surprisingly great.

The Cheesecake Factory,"We came early on a weekday for lunch, so the line wasnt nearly as long as itd usually be. The Canadian menu is exactly the same as the one they have in the US. I've been to cheese cake factory a few times in the US. In comparison, the Canadian cheese cake factory feels sloppy.. and slow. We ordered their most famous chicken dish - maderia  chicken and the chicken cutlet with mashed potato (forgot it's name ). The maderia chicken was paired with a wine sauce and mushrooms. It tasted an awful lot like an Asian chicken dish you can get from those Chinese take out places. It almost came with a large side of mashed potato. Unfortunately , you can still see there were chunks of potato in the mash. When in cheese cake factory, one must never leave without ordering cheesecake, even if it's to go. The cheese cake slices we ordered we're very standard. But they took 15 mins to come .

The Cheesecake Factory,"Food is as expected, not over-the-top great but not disappointing. Portions are big and I think that's their signature. Had enough to eat for lunch and packed the leftovers for dinner. I wasn't too impressed with their cheeseburger spring rolls. Fish tacos could also used a bit more seasoning. So was it worth the wait to get in? Maybe, if you've never been, just to check that off your bucket list. But, don't set high expectations on the food. Alternatively, if you're told to wait a few hours it'd be faster to drive to Walden Galleria mall in Buffalo to eat at the Cheesecake Factory location there! Tip: I've been told you can ask to sit at the bar to get seated more quickly. Another tip: if you REALLY want to go, pick a weekday and go between 2-3pm when it's slowest (even then you'll have to queue).",3.0,4.0,149,2018-01-23,43.724775,-79.45538,"Desserts , Burgers , Pizza"

My boyfriend and I had to wait forever, literally. We waited about 3 hours or even a bit more. Despite waiting for such a long time, our waitress was kind and attentive. She provided us with everything we needed, and checked up on us to see if everything was okay. The food.. hmm, both pasta dishes we ordered needed A LOT more flavour, it was bland. Out of the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and the Pasta Napoletana, the Pasta Napoletana was much better. The cheesecake on the other hand, was amazing! We got the red velvet cheesecake and the oreo dream extreme cheesecake for take-out. Once we received our bill, we realized that we were charged for wine and soda, however we did not order those. However, once we told our waitress, she removed the soda and gave us a new bill which STILL included the wine. It was kind of funny at first, but then it just took a while to leave from there. At the end, she ended up removing both of them and apologized. So make sure you double check your bill! All in all, I prefer the Buffalo location over the Toronto location.

The Cheesecake Factory,"What was life without the cheesecake factory in Toronto? Probably involved driving down to Buffalo for a day of shopping at Walden Galleria before lining up to eat at the cheesecake factory. Well, now you don't need to cross the border! Since the initial rush has died down a bit, you might be able to get a table within a reasonable amount of time, depending when you choose to go. We got there early on a Sunday morning and when we were seated at 11:30, the wait was already 75-90 min long. YMMV. Make sure you ask what's the range of the buzzer or you might miss it.When it comes to food, my go-to appetizer, the fried chicken sliders were ON POINT. If you don't like pickles, you'll want to try them here because it makes the whole slider. My go-to main, the chicken and biscuits were the best I've had so far since they put the biscuits on top so it doesn't get soggy from the gravy. Other dishes we had were the fried fish tacos and the Thai coconut-lime chicken. The fish was great, and chipotle sauce added a nice kick. The Thai coconut-lime chicken was quite flavorful - one thing to note about all the mains is that they're HUGE. We each only finished half the plate and took the rest home. So even though the prices seem expensive, you do get what you pay for. If you do pack leftovers, make sure you tell them what you want to keep. They didn't even give me the gravy. *insert angry face*All in all, the food lives up to the name so you really don't need to goto Buffalo - however you could be waiting for hours to get a table. The size of the restaurant is definitely too small for its popularity and the kitchen could probably be bigger to get dishes out faster to accommodate demand. Oh well, they do have high standards for quality, and when a dish didn't come out on time they owned it and left us with a great impression. We will be back! 5/5 (if you get a table quickly).",3.0,5.0,149,2018-01-23,43.724775,-79.45538,"Desserts , Burgers , Pizza"
The Cheesecake Factory,"Came here twice already and I love it. First time I went, I waited for 40 minutes (4 people) and the second time I went (5 people + baby) I waited about 2 and a half hours. When there's a lineup, you receive a buzzer which will buzz if you're not super far away from the restaurant.When seated, you receive complimentary bread and butter. I've tried the following dishes: deep fried mac and cheese balls, baja fish tacos, truffle honey chicken, four cheese pasta, and an asian style salad. As mentioned, yes the portions are HUGE for one person. If you don't want to pack food home, you could share a dish between two people. I highly recommend the truffle honey chicken!! Chicken was cooked perfectly and was deep fried to perfect. It was placed on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes which was also nicely flavoured. I DON'T recommend the baja tacos - it literally was mostly batter and the size is kind of small. The spiced rice and beans were disgusting. And of course, the cheesecake is delicious - the slices aren't extremely big but they are TALL slices. For ~$10 a slice, I'm not sure if I'd say it's worth it since I don't normally eat dessert at a restaurant. However, I would recommend the celebration cheesecake!Service is great - they talk to you slightly slow with patience since they want to make a good impression. They never want to rush you or feel like you need to eat and get out.Personally, I wouldn't wait more than an hour if it weren't for my family wanting to try the restaurant.

The Cheesecake Factory,"I've always been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory because of their large selection of food and big portion. I was excited to try The Cheesecake Factory to see if it'll be the same as the States.The fried zucchini ($7.95) was very good - perfectly coated and deep friend. There were no issues with the batter falling off the zucchini. I remember enjoying the avocado eggrolls ($14.95) and they were also really good especially with the minty sauce. I like how they took two very healthy food and turned it unhealthy :PThe Pasta da Vinci ($16.95 - lunch portion) had caramelized onions, mushrooms, and chicken. The chicken was very tender and the overall dish was very flavourful. I thought the portion was decent for the price.The service was great and the food came quite quickly. They were incredibly organized with the whole lineup (which they should be since they've been opened for a while now).

The Cheesecake Factory,"Went on a monday night hoping it wont be as busy, and when we walked over to their host booth. They handed us a buzzer and told us 1 hour and 45 minutes and we have to be in a certain vicinity. So we walked around mall and then went down and had some drinks at pickle barrell. About an hour and 15 minutes later the buzzer went off earlier than expected- which we thought was delightful. However the hostess accidentally somehow buzzed everyone on the list and there was a giant queue of confused people. They fixed the error rather quickly and we were told there is another 25 minute wait. So we just kind of stood around the bar and the buzzer went off- but at least i know why they always fighting at cheese cake!! ( please ignore lame attempt to make a drake reference).I tried the stuffed cheeseburger and it was delicious with chedder oozing out the middle and also started off with the spring roll platter that came with a choice of salmon, chicken, avacado and ground beef spring rolls with different dipping sauces. They were all good. Unfortunately i had loaded up on beer while waiting for so long that i had no room for cheesecake at the cheesecake factory.Till next time i guess.",3.0,4.0,149,2018-01-11,43.724775,-79.45538,"Desserts , Burgers , Pizza"
The Cheesecake Factory,"Lined up for 1.5hour to get the pager to try out the new cheesecake factory at Yorkdale. The lineup was quite the experience, they had security escort us through different segments of the line throughout the mall. After we finally got to the pager, the wait was about 30mins more.Food:I really enjoyed the food in terms of taste and portion size. Ordered the chicken Bellagio and the combination with pasta was good. Chicken was nice and crispy, sauce was good balance of flavour and creaminess. I ordered dulce de leche cheesecake and celebration cheesecake. Celebration was Allright, nothing special since it has too much of the add ons which take away from it. Dulce de leche is good!Atmosphere:The atmosphere and service was great. Very accommodating and attentive. They advised us that there was a long wait for cheesecake and to choose early and order it at the same time as the entree. Although I changed my mind halfway through the meal, they were still able to accommodate with getting it to me in a reasonable time frame after my meal. I wish there wasn't such a long wait for a table so that I can visit again more.",3.0,4.0,149,2018-01-04,43.724775,-79.45538,"Desserts , Burgers , Pizza"

Sigh..... It's not worth it, it's just a cheesecake. I ordered a steak, I don't know why I did that. The first bite was good, then all I did was chew, chew and chew after that.

The Cheesecake Factory,"I lined up on a Monday at 11:00. The restaurant opens at 11:30. Now that's dedication. I was absolutely determined to eat here! I ended up sitting at 12:15 - they don't want to overwhelm the kitchen so they seat tables slowly.Beware if you come in a big group - they do not reserve for tables bigger than 7. You would need to split your group into two tables and based on the lines, unfortunately there is no guarantee on where they will be sitting (may not be close to each other). Luckily I lined up early enough to get first pick of the tables and the hostess kindly arranged for our two tables to be together.Now onto the food. Yes these are big portions but you are definitely paying for it. The pasta I got costs $25 but it doesn't not feel like it's worth the $10 extra for a bigger portion. You are definitely stuffed from eating one entrée. Food wise, definitely good for a chain restaurant but there is more focus on quantity than quality. I really liked the cheesecake. I tried the tiramisu cheesecake - so surprised by how light it was! I think the slice looks smaller than the states but it was good!

The Cheesecake Factory,"As someone who has been frequenting the cheesecake factory for years, I was ecstatic when they opened it so close to me.My first experience was takeout, and I got my favourite Louisiana chicken pasta, plus the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake . The pasta was just like the states, so I was very happy. However, I also ordered the avocado egg rolls, and it wasn't in my bag when I came home. I emailed the cheesecake factory as advised on the phone, and this issue still hasn't been resolved and it's been a few weeks. I find that to be very poor customer service, especially for a new restaurant. I went back with my gfs last Friday to dine in for our annual secret Santa dinner. We enjoyed their wine, and also got a second bottle. The apps were very delicious, and highly recommend the stuffed mushrooms and avocado egg rolls. We also got the buffalo blasts, which were good, but huge! I ordered the chicken parm pizza and my gf ordered the jambalaya pasta. It was insanely salty. I hate sending food back, but my gf also was not able to eat it. We sent it back, and then got our food with less salt, but then it tasted absolutely bland for both of us. Our gfs were pretty much done eating so, we just ate two bites and asked to pack it up. We felt bad to send it back again but we both just didn't want to eat anymore. Our server Amanda was really nice and apologetic. We each ordered cheesecake, and found that enjoyable. I liked my red velvet cheesecake very much. I would say 2.5 stars, as the service was great, as were the apps and dessert. But for my outstanding takeout issue and the taste of our mains, I deducted some huge points.*I updated this to 3 stars because they sent me an apology and a gift card for 25 dollars due to the issues I had.",3.0,3.0,149,2017-12-21,43.724775,-79.45538,"Desserts , Burgers , Pizza"

The Cheesecake Factory,"Had to try the first Canadian location after countless visits to the US. Both my fiancé and I agree that it did not disappoint. The portion size, interior design and menus are all the same. The prices are slightly higher which is to be expected since it is in Canadian dollar. We ordered the buffalo blasts as a starter and they were great. Fried chicken fillets stuffed with cheese and buffalo sauce with blue cheese and more buffalo sauce on the side for dipping. For a starter, this came with 7 huge pieces, good for sharing in larger groups rather than just us 2. For the mains, I ordered the louisiana chicken pasta while the fiancé had their daily special which was a Thai glazed salmon. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the crispy Louisiana chicken complemented it well. The salmon tasted very fresh and was not overcooked. To finish off our meal, we ordered the strawberry shortcake which consists of 2 shortcakes cut in half, with ice cream in the middle, surrounded by a mound of fresh strawberries, a must try. We also had a few cheesecake slices for take out. My only gripe however is the lineup to get in. Had to wait about an hour for a buzzer and came back an hour after we were given one to be seated. Granted, it was only their second week of operation so I'll give them a bit of a reprieve. For those who do not want to wait that long, they have a take out counter as well outside of the restaurant.

The Cheesecake Factory,I waited for three long hours to get in. I got the calamari for app and two pastas and two cheesecakes to go. Portions as one can imagine mirror the ones in the states. BIG! The service was excellent people were nice and restaurant did not change from its counterparts in the states. The cheesecakes were great I got the coffee chocolate one and a strawberry one to go.

The Cheesecake Factory,"Where do I start off? Luckily skipped that horrendous line up that wraps around Victoria secret just to get that buzzer and your name down. We got sat down at the booths near the mall entrance ( try not to sit there because it's freezing cold cause of the mall entrance door) Problem is they seated us fast, however have awfully lazy servers who never checked up on our table, and our food took 1hour to come!!!We ordered the Topical blended drinknwith raspberry swirl, Nashville  bites, Pizza Parmigana with angel hair pasta, Orange chicken ( for fun) and the Spicy Chicken and Shrimp Cajun pasta. Now these are all dishes we enjoy very much in the USA. And find delicious and well balanced flavours. However at Cheesecake in Canada, our rules, regulations and safety standard's definitly tweaked the taste ... and not in a good way! The meat all tasted like a Tofu substitute or maybe 30% meat and rest filler. The Pizza Style Parmigana is supposed to be chopped up and seasoned chicken breast. Like I said it tasted like seasoned tofu or processed fake chicken meats! Didn't expect that with Canada's high food standards. The food was all SALT salt salt. But not no sugar to create the blissful perfection of sweet and savoury ( which is for sure the reasons why we eat out ! Seasoning) So salty we couldn't stomach It, and packed up to go containers. Getting back to the sad part of waiting 1 hour to received our food, while watchinf others getting their mains, who had arrived before us . There were others in the same or worse boat than us ! Waiting 2 hours for their food. Now this is where it gets good, the Cajun pasta, changed the seasoning from the USA one added more salt and less Cayenne and Paprika. The seasoning wasn't spicy like usual. This dish is the reason why my husband and I are on the toilet and sick!!! Very disappointed in the standards and how this restaurant was run. No good first impressions here. The staff were dismissive when complaints were made by us, snickering and gossiping about customers at their attendent station, and management was so flustered they forgot why they are even at our table. I watched endlessly as our experience also was what everyone else felt too in our section ! The management blamed our one dish as the reason the rest of food was late, however it happened to be the coldest thing we got lol.... Anyways I have said enough. I understand it will never be the same as USA. But it isn't even close to reaching the first hurdle in service, quality and taste. ! I dont recommend this or even wasting time waiting.

The Cheesecake Factory,Extremely overratedI went on a Saturday morning for bring at 10:30am there was a wait for the dining room but the high tables at the bar were open so I sat there.The waiter was full of life a little lost but still fun.I ordered the chicken and waffle Benedict's. The egg was poached perfectly but I couldn't taste them because of the thick over powering hollandaise sauce. The waffles were fluffy but again lost in the sauce and the chicken taste like your average chicken fingers.  The home fries were okay.I did order the Hershey crunch cheesecake to go. Now that was delicious I would definitely recommend trying the cheesecake such rich and creamy flavors.

The Cheesecake Factory,"You will need to decide if it's worth a three hour wait to get in. Clearly, it's testament to Cheesecake Factory's popularity, but I have never had to wait more than 45 minutes at a US based location. Canadians must have a serious hunger for good food. By the time we were seated, I had a pretty serious hunger!Immediately, I ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls to take the edge off the hunger. They arrived fairly quickly based on the packed house. The wrapper was a bit soggy, and they had a bit of trouble holding together. For my main dish, I ordered the Tuna Tataki Salad at $24. A few bucks short of a Keg Classic Prime Rib, it was a very nice piece of sushi grade tuna, seared perfectly and then chilled. I ate the tuna and sliced avocado, and left the greens behind.  A pricey meal for what you get. Service was as good as it could be based on a packed house, but when a staff break came up, our section was added to another server's section and  we were largely forgotten. Love the food-won't be back. When the popularity wanes, and wait times drop to under an hour, I'll come back and try to pick up where I left off.

The staff are well educated on their beer offerings and the food. We had great service from the beginning of our meal to the moment we left.We ordered a large bistro salad, the fries, and the spicy red Thai muscles. The salad was perfect to share, it had a good dressing and variety of veggies. With no protein, I probably wouldn't order this as a main. The Belgian frites were phenomenal. Blanched in beef tallow and duck fat, and served with house made mayo, they were probably some of the best fries I've ever had. Perfectly crunchy, salty and very flavourful on their own. The muscles were cooked in a flavourful broth with peppers and onions. They were tender and a little spicy and came with sourdough for dipping.

Beerbistro,"2.5 (but that felt too harsh)Full disclaimer, the food lived up to the hype, the service is really where they took the hit (as well as the pricey-ness overall, but that is to be expected I guess). I made a reservation on a Friday for 5pm, and they told me only upon arriving that we had a two hour seating limit (not usually an issue, except our waitress had a bad habit of disappearing for 20 minute intervals between delivering food and drinks, but I digress). The place has a warm and hoppin' atmosphere with the bar side seemingly like a financial district watering hole and the dining room at the back being more formal. The ""featured beers"" prices vary A LOT (from $7.08 - $38.50 for single pours). The ""normal beers"" in the menu are much more reasonable and so tasty! The belgian fries are delicious and crispy, with homemade ketchup. The mussels are also great! We had the brussel mussels (spicy and a little sausage-smokey), and the english mussels (like a chowder, but less rich, and a nice bacon potato taste). They come with cold bread (that should definitely be warmed for such a nice place...the small things make a BIG difference!).THIS IS ABOUT THE SAD SERVICE (so feel free to disregard): Our waitress was THE WORST! She disappeared for long stretches and failed to check in. I had to ask for ketchup 3 times before it arrived at the table. She kept bringing food to the wrong tables, seemed angry when we wanted to order more food, or drinks and was surly and rude. While everything about the restaurant seemed to scream financial district decadence, their service made them seem like your subpar suburb diner).

Beerbistro,"Our attraction to Beerbistro was partly fueled by a want for poutine as late night snack and a need for an eatery that is not ear-splitting loud. As we walked down the street, we quickly realized that our options may be a lot more limited than we had previously realized, as the late hours meant that most of the places that were open in the vicinity would be pubs and bars or clubs, all of which equal very loud noise. Thankfully, just when we were ready to resign ourselves and enter a random pub, we found Beerbistro.Beerbistro to me is a unique eatery with a casual ""lounge"" feel to it. From the moment we walked in and sat down around one of their tables, I could feel the tension on my shoulders and back start to melt away. Because it was late at night on a weekend (and because this is after all a beer bistro), people are drinking of course, and there are a few drunks around, but the noise level is very comfortable. My group could talk without having to raise our voices, and without feeling like we might have to whisper or risk disturbing other people. The place was quite packed for the night, but somehow the atmosphere of the place was still relaxing; it didn't at all feel packed.  I keep wanting to return to the word comfortable because that's what it felt like to me.At the server's recommendation, we ordered some ephemere pomme ale - quite delicious! - along with the poutine that had sent us out on our quest in the first place. We had two of their poutine in fact, the supreme, and the pulled pork. Personally, I have to recommend the pulled pork poutine over the supreme; the pulled pork is simply one bowl of deliciousness. Savory pulled pork bbq and half melted cheese curds and thin ribbons of sriracha over fries, and when the pork and cheese are gone and you think you're left with boring fries, what awaits at the bottom of the bowl are fries soaked in well-made delicious chicken gravy. As far as a late night snack goes, this is an A+. We walked away from Beerbistro very much satisfied and relaxed.

I would definitely recommend you make a reservation or else you might get stuck waiting around as some people had to. I saw big crowds near the door. I went in and was promptly seated with a coat check (no fee). Dining with a friend and we shared the steak frites (a bit pricey but a filling portion). It was good, tendor, cooked exactly as requested, and uncut. We found the knives a bit dull though. For drinks, I was a bit indecisive on what I should get so just told our server I wanted something light and sweet. They recommended the À Tout le Monde beer from Quebec under their Spicy section. Quite happy with their recommendation, it was refreshing, light, sweet, and reasonably priced. Great pick! I would definitely recommend this beer.

Beerbistro,"This review is my 500th! My rating is 4.5 stars. A former student of mine, who has become my friend, is doing an eight-month work term downtown. I went on a team event at work and sailed for a couple of hours on Lake Ontario. I ended up being a tourist for most of the day before meeting up with her for an early dinner at 17:00 at Beerbistro. I went on this restaurant's Web site and decided to book a reservation for us. It was easy and seamless. It was a muggy, humid day. I went in and was happy to see a bowl of LifeSavers mints. They are my favourite ones. I knew that I would love being here. My reservation was acknowledged. I got a table in a quaint corner of the restaurant. I texted my friend to indicate where I was. She was happy that I chose being indoors. The patio looked great, but not when you are sweating buckets!She came. We hugged. The problem is that I was at a table where it is elevated by a step. I am about half a foot taller than she is, so I joked that it was a tall hug!We are both foodies. So, we were down trying multiple items on the menu.Here's our order:- Beef tallow and duck fat fries- Truffle potato perogies- Beef tacos- Creamsicle cheesecake- Flourless chocolate stout cake- LifeSavers mints- Diet Pepsi This place is known for its beer and fries. The fries were so flavourful and delicious! I often avoid getting fries when I can, but you do not here!The truffle perogies were amazing. They were pan-fried crispy, but not to the point where your jaw is tired.We both agreed that the beef tacos were incredible. It even has fries in them! The fried onions also made them particularly yummy. I loved both desserts. They were creamy and full of flavour. My friend doesn't like beer, so she wasn't to crazy about the flourless chocolate stout cake. She ended up eating more of the creamsicle cheesecake (it's excellent) and I had most of the chocolate cake. It does have a stout aftertaste. It didn't bother me. I'd order it again! However, if you aren't big on beer in your desserts, skip this one. We spent three hours catching up with each other. Lots of business folks come by here after work for a drink, so expect folks in suits and business attire. I just wore a t-shirt, jeans, and sneakers. I highly recommend coming here for dinner and drinks. It gets busy, but you can still hear what your friend is saying across the table. The food is worth the visit.

The broth was delicious and mussels were cooked to perfection. I didn't get any unopened mussels which is rare when you order mussels.

It reminds me of my favorite restaurant in the Washington DC area called Mussel Bar.For brunch, they serve brunch cocktails, eggs benedicts, burgers, and mussels. The staff were friendly.Our party ordered Brussel Mussels, Spicy Red Thai Mussels, Avocado Toast, Bistro Salad, Belgian White Mussels, and Blanche de Chambly and Beet Cured Smoked Salmon Benedict. The Belgian White Mussels consisted of well shucked mussels steamed in a flavorful beer broth made of Blanche De Chambly, lemon, garlic, and heavy cream. The Mussels were a shareable portion.

Beerbistro,"Trying to say something new about Beerbistro is a fool's errand. Everyone worth their salt in the lower downtown core has probably been there at least once.I was torn between a three- and four-star rating for this place. While there's plenty to drink and eat, there are some rookie mistakes that should (and probably could) have been avoided.Chief among them is their list of drinks. I have no problem with a restaurant that switches its beer menu around - I rarely drink beer anyway. None of my concern. What I am concerned by is the fact that no one on the staff last night knew how to make a mojito. You know how to make a complex drink with maple syrup, Maker's Mark, cinnamon and a half-dozen other ingredients, but you don't know how to muddle mint and mix rum in it? Considering the number of other mixed drinks this place offers, I don't buy for a second the line from the waitress about keeping their menu small.I was on one of those ""brooding, Sonny Crockett-esque"" moods, and not having a mojito disappointed me. I went for the concoction mentioned above, called a Cinnamon Maple Bourbon Sour. A good drink, but it was overtaken by the cinnamon. Were it not for what followed next, I likely would have rated Beerbistro a 2 on this drink alone.Those fries.Those damned duck fat fries.HOLY MOTHER OF GOD. The taste is out of this world. The aioli is so good that my friends and I ended up ordering additional bowls of it. It seems like the container holding them is bottomless. It doesn't even matter that it's $7. It justifies the trip on its own. A couple bites of those fries and I instantly understood why this place is so popular. It may not be the cheapest beer joint around, but it more than makes up for it in the quality of its dishes. My friend had a salmon dish and reported that it was very good as well.The other reason you would come here is for a date. My friends and I were hanging on the patio after a Jays game, and watched multiple couples weaving in and out of the place. One woman was fawning over her date, while another looked like she was about to strangle the man she was with. The scenery at Beerbistro alone is worth the price of admission. I would contend that at this price point, there are few better spots to go with a loved one. The atmosphere is incredible.I haven't even had a chance to check out the inside (which looked nice from what I saw), but I plan on going back very soon.In the end, I rated Beerbistro a 4. Although it has a few small issues, this is a fantastic spot to hang with friends and enjoy the night.Recommended.",4.0,4.0,557,2017-08-10,43.649817,-79.377147,"Canadian (New) , Pubs , Bistros"
Beerbistro,"4 stars for the fries only. Months later, I still dream about the fries. Belgian-style. Fried in duck fat. Excellent portion. What more can you ask for?Extensive selection of beer. What's great is you can try any 3 draft beers for $6 for 4 oz pours. Mussels were nothing memorable, though the sauce was perfect with the delicious complimentary bread.We hung out in the bar area, which had comfortable seating and fantastic service. This was a short stop for us, just a quick bite and beer, so we didn't get to try the rest of the menu. But I would definitely stop for the fries if I'm in the area.

New Orleans Seafood & Steakhouse,"What else can I say about this wonderful place. The service was fantastic, the food was fresh, flavorful, authentic and simply amazing. Our group of 4 came in here really unplanned as we happened to be in the area. I love the fact that it is a small place but felt very cozy and inviting. The decor was very well put together and really felt like you're in a local New Orleans restaurant.We ordered cajun calamari, coconut beer shrimp and mussels for appetizers and for the main course the fresh fish of the day (3) and Fisherman's plate (1), All were excellent choices! The owner Mike was so friendly, he spent a lot of time talking to us and just having a great conversation. In fact, we were having such a good time, we were the last customers by the time we left.

The young waitress was friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient.  She was backed by our host who demanded we stay for a complimentary birthday pecan pie and creme carmel!  Who says no to awesome homemade desserts!

New Orleans Seafood & Steakhouse,"What makes New Orleans different from other restaurants is the amazing service, that is always number one for me. I would rather eat at a mediocre restaurant but with fantastic service, than a place that has horrible service but great  food. It just ruins the whole experience. However, New Orleans is a triple threat: good food, good service, good ambiance. Our waitress was lovely, had a calm and pleasant demeanor, and was very attentive. We ordered the cajun mussels and the special of the day, which is what I would recommend. Since this place is known for seafood, I chose mahi mahi and my boyfriend picked the salmon. When the dish came it looked great, very simple but I think a lot of care and steps were taken to make the dish delicious. It was served with some roasted/grilled veggies, some rice, and about I'd say 6 oz of mahi mahi. I bit into it, and wow. So tasty and fresh. The texture was firm on the outside, but once you bit it, it was soft but not crumbly in an overcooked way. The cajun mussels were super fresh as well, because a lot of places that serve you mussels, they almost taste like they were frozen because they have that wrinkly/shrunken look and really chewy with a hard texture. But the mussels here had a bouncy exterior, but was semi soft to the bite. The sauce definitely had cajun seasoning and I really could have just drank  the whole thing from the bowl. It was that good.The owner I think came to check on our table and also ran out the door to check with us again as we left the restaurant. We were both fast eaters and sort of just left quite quickly. I think that's how New Orleans gets returning customers (from what I've read from previous reviews), it is because they take the time to chat with you and connect with you.I was so happy with my experience and food. Yes, it is steep, and yes I will fork out money for it again. You get what you pay for.

New Orleans Seafood & Steakhouse,"Super mixed feelings about this placePros: This area (Scarlett road and Eglinton) is a wasteland devoid of all culinary richness, so anything to ameliorate that is a welcome.  The food seems decent.  The staff are nice in a kind of weird way. Cons: Service was slow AF. Place is in a tiny strip mall. Clientele are middle aged to older white suburban folks. We get seated and the waitress says ""Ok how about we get you started with some drinks?"" We said we just want water. She said ""ok great"" and smiled, but it was one of those smiles that was like ""I bet these cheap water drinking bastards are not going to give me a good tip but my job requires me to smile so I will smile at them."" It's like you're on a first date and you suggest you go for tacos and your date tells you she doesn't eat tacos because they are emblematic of the legacy of repression and cultural appropriation foisted upon the latinx peoples and she will not be a party to reproducing those colonial racist narratives, and you smile at her and say ""ok great!"" as you think oh jesus god what have I gotten myself into?  Maybe I was reading too much into it.Anywho we order the Jambalaya because that's their thing.  The menu warns it takes 35 minutes to make and it did. It came, super steamy mouth burny hot, so be careful.  It was good, it was decent, I liked it, but for $60 it didn't knock my socks off.  Am I glad I tried it? Yeah. Would I come back and get it again? Probably not. So anyway it's huge and even for two people it's way way too huge. So Mike (I'm guessing he's Mike because other Yelp reviewers talk about how nice Mike is) is this older kinda chubby white grandfatherly dude who I see walking around the restaurant chatting with folks. I assume he's the owner because while the other two waitresses are busting their asses with a restaurant full of customers on a Friday night he's sauntering around chatting up folks and he also is the only one who takes the payments.  Anyway he comes by and asks how our food is, I say good, but can we get a takeaway container for the rest of the Jambalaya?  He says ""No no, take your time, take your time"" and then just walks away. Wait what? After dinner our waitress comes and reads the desert options, and I remember I checked online and they had ""Banana Foster"" which looked interesting and I ask her if they have it because she didn't mention it.  She says she'll have to ask the kitchen if they can make it because if it's really busy they won't make it. Okay.. She leaves and.. doesn't come back.  Like fifteen minutes later she still isn't back (this is a small restaurant with only one room) so I don't know if she went on break or perhaps she decided that would be an opportune moment to quit and run away to Madagascar with her lover, or what but she didn't come back.  Eventually another waitress asks us if we want desert, I said I wanted the banana foster, she says she will check with the kitchen if they can make it.  Oh god I think, what if the same fate befalls her? What if this is like some teen horror movie where they always split up and decide to explore different parts of the building alone and the killer always hunts them down one by one ""DON'T GO IN THE KITCHEN!"" I want to scream.. ""THE LAST ONE WHO DID NEVER CAME OUT ALIVE!"" but she does... anyway she comes back a few minutes later and says no problem they can make it. Cool.   We get the desert and the banana foster is pretty good, the syrup is crazy sweet though.  Then we want to pay.  We want to pay but we cannot pay, the waitresses are both running around like crazy (oh the first one finally did re-emerge from the kitchen so I guess she didn't run away and/or get murdered), and Mike is doing his folksy thing at the other tables, we sit for like 20 minutes with our empty plates in front of us. I mean, I know, first world problems right? It was fine I was just chatting with my companion but like Zzzzz, finally I flag down a waitress and ask to pay.  They give us the bill in a big folder that boldly states  WE PROUDLY ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS.  I put my American Express card in the folder, and wait for Mike to come over with the machine. ""Oh sorry we don't accept American Express. We accepted it for 16 years but not any more.""  The 16 years thing was weirdly specific but, ok I paid with Mastercard. Then Mike says hey this is your first time here right? How bout I bring you a little aperitif thing on the house. And we are like sure. So he brings us these little glasses of liqueur, not sure what it was but it tasted like an After Eight mint. Anyway that was nice and all but I mean, how about you bring us the thing we actually asked for and wanted (the takeaway box) when we asked for it.  I cannot say such terrible things to such a folksy grandfatherly man, so I do not.  Bottom line, decent food, service is weird/nice?/slow.",5.0,3.0,70,2017-07-16,43.677592,-79.506363,"Seafood , Cajun/Creole , Steakhouses"

TORCH Pressed Sushi,"This place is BOMB! The torched sushi at this place is really good! I came here on the weekend on there last day of their grand opening promo. Luckily I had 3 people (including myself) with me so I could pretty much order the entire menu and try almost everything they have. This was my order: All torched obviously - Salmon  (got extra 3 pieces from their promo)-  Spicy Salmon-  Shrimp-  Tempura Shrimp - Unagi - Red snapper- Tuna  - Poke bowl and torched spicy salmon poke I would describe every single torched sushi on that list but then this would be a long ass review and take too much typing. Needless to say the best and my personal favorite was the salmon which I got extra of too. It was a great choice to get more of the salmon too. The salmon is soft and loaded with so much flavor. I find that this place is also quite generous with there slices of sashimi that they give you. They do not pack the whole aburi with rice. The portion ratio of rice versus fish is well balanced. My least favorite one was the tempura shrimp. I just thought it was very original and didn't have much creativity or much flavor to that one. Perhaps I should of ate it with some soy sauce but most of the time aburi's you rarely need to dip it into soy sauce since there is already taste. Both poke bowls were outstanding! Very generous in quantity and I thought the size was perfect for 2 people to share or even 1 person ( if your super hungry). The torched salmon poke was the first I have ever eaten torched poke and it did not disappoint. The original poke bowl was very good as well. They give you really good toppings such as seaweed salad, corn, peas, avocados and a mix of tuna and salmon fish. Very delicious spot for aburi's and poke in North York. Definitely would come another time and eat everything on my list all over again and maybe try the yam & banana.Staff there are really nice and pleasant. Cool guys! Parking is a tough considering this place is located right on Yonge Street. There is limited parking in the Katsuya plaza.

I ordered the torched salmon sushi, spicy salmon rice bowl and yam banana torch sushi. Sushi orders are made fresh as you order. The quality was okay but not as spectacular as some of the reviewers describe it to be. For this price, I could go to other places with better seating and more quantity.

TORCH Pressed Sushi,"WHAT I GOT:- Torched Salmon, Torched Unagi, Torched Red Snapper, and Torched Tuna. A promotion of buying 12 pieces led to an additional salad, soup, and pop for free.TASTE: [4/5]- I'm a big fan of blow torched sushi and pressed sushi. I liked how their menu had options I haven't seen at other sushi restaurants. Each type tasted unique and my favourite had to be the Torched Salmon and Torched Red Snapper. Both had toppings and sauces that complemented the torched flavour. Additional ingredients were tucked away inside each pressed sushi which kept every bite interesting and flavourful. The Torched Unagi also had an interesting seaweed seasoning on the bottom of each piece.PRESENTATION: [4/5]- At first I was questioning why it took about 10 minutes to make 12 pieces of sushi but once they came out, I found that each type of pressed sushi looked unique and skillfully assembled.SERVICE: [5/5]- The cashier was attentive to the details of my order and kept me updated on how soon our food would come. He also went out of his way to provide additional servings of the sides (e.g. salad and soup) for my partner and other guests in the restaurant. But wait there is more, they ran out of simple salad but made and offered us seaweed salad instead. They went above and beyond for us and other guests in the restaurant.THE LAST WORD: - I would come here if you like blowtorched sushi and pressed sushi.

TORCH Pressed Sushi,"This is a good place to get takeout torch pressed sushi without the fancy ambiance that you'd get at a downtown or midtown restaurant.  They're still fairly new and seems like they're still trying to work out logistics and efficiency during busy hours, so it took about 15-20 minutes to get 9 pieces of torched sushi for takeout.  The total came to $22, which I thought was a bit pricey.  It definitely wasn't enough to make two people full, but we came to get a quick snack since we were in the area, and it was a good snack! The guy who worked there was very nice and apologized for the wait and gave us two free miso soups which was nice of him, even though we were supposed to get only one.  We tried the spicy salmon, unagi and red snapper, and all were flavourful but I think the red snapper was the best one in my opinion.All in all, I'd probably come back here for a snack, but it's not in a convenient location as there is no parking.

TORCH Pressed Sushi,"The sushi here is fresh - they make it right in front of you!  It's a TINY spot with just a few bar/counter seats so plan on take-out.  Best to park on the side street or better yet in the plaza across the street.I ordered the torched spicy salmon; torched red snapper and the torched shrimp based on the previous reviews I read.  I wish the spciy salmon was a bit more spicy, but everything tasted fresh and delicious.the best part is you can order in 3 pieces or 6 pieces of a particular kind of sushi so it let's you try out a variety.  It isn't particularly cheap but it's very good.Service is super friendly.  I had to wait about 15 minutes for my order (was told of this when I ordered so not an issue at all).Definitely will be back!",4.0,4.0,39,2018-01-09,43.789482,-79.418195,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
TORCH Pressed Sushi,"TORCH showed up on just about all my social platforms. Eventually, I gave in and went to try on their last day of the BOGO promo. Did it live up to the hype? Ehhhh.It was okay. Staff was friendly, parking is a disaster. It's good but given their price point, I wasn't blown away. We ordered 24pcs in total, varying in:- Spicy Salmon- Salmon- Unagi- Red Snapper- Tempura Shrimp(We didn't get any pop or salad that's included in the 12 PC promos)The best? Spicy Salmon/Salmon. This was definitely the most flavorful.The worst? Tempura Shrimp. Like another reviewer, I found it unique at first, as you don't usually see this in pressed sushi. However, in tasting it, it fell behind. It's literally tempura shrimp on rice. I would also suggest opting out on the Unagi. Seeing as how Unagi is already cooked, torching it didn't do anything for its flavour profile. Unfortunately, it tasted like regular Unagi nigiri to us, and definitely not worth the premium. What you also won't be thrilled about? The wait. We arrived at 4, to find them CLOSED until 4:30. TORCH had closed to take their lunch and prep for future orders. I get it? We were lucky to have a car to wait in, but I feel for those who traveled all the way there without a vehicle, to wait in the cold or be turned away. Even after they reopened, they took 3 orders of 12-24pcs and all others had to wait an additional 30 minutes. People weren't ordering party trays (that I'd understand).DEFINITELY call ahead. Would I go back? Probably not. It's a unique takeout place, but on top of the price, the wait isn't worth it.",4.0,3.0,39,2018-01-03,43.789482,-79.418195,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
TORCH Pressed Sushi,"Fabulous food and service!!! We arrived around 1:15pm on a Friday. The place is pretty tiny, but only about half the seats were filled. However, there did seem to be a lot of customers getting take out, so they were also busy fulfilling those orders.The wait time for food is absolutely worth it. The staff make each order fresh on the spot. I would sacrifice time for high-quality food, and with the open kitchen, you can watch each step in the process.They had a ""buy one get one"" deal going on, so my friend and I ordered two poke bowls and two 6-piece rolls for about $28:     - torched spicy salmon bowl     - poké bowl     - torched unagi     - torched red snapperThe bowls are a little smaller than other poké bowls I've tried, but it ended up being a solid amount of food for two people. Sushi was torched to perfection, and the bowls tasted delicious as well. The boss was quite attentive to us throughout our meal, and didn't seem to mind that we spent around two hours eating and chatting. The restaurant became quite empty after 2:30pm. Right before we left, a photographer came in and appeared to be working with the boss on some promotional material, so keep an eye out for those!

TORCH Pressed Sushi,"Had to jump in on this buy one get one free promo!Torched pressed sushi, depending on which fish you choose, they range around $6.50 for 3 pieces. I had unagi, salmon, tuna and red snapper. All were flavorful and had a decent ratio of protien and ricem. Red snapper was my favorite, in the middle it had pieces of tempura shrimp. The poke bowls, range from $12-14. We went for the spicy salmon poke bowl, and the torched unagi bowl. The spicy salmon bowl was good, lots of protein and without all the other ingredients, like how real poke bowls should be. The unagi bowl was disappointing though, tasted like the premade unagis you buy at the grocery store and just topped on rice. Tbh It's quite expensive, so I would definitely go now while they are doing their buy one get one free promo!

TORCH Pressed Sushi,"We stumbled across this newly opened sushi restaurant on yonge, tempted by their soft opening special of buy one get one free, my boyfriend and I walked in. The interior is clean and well lit with lots of natural lighting. The owner greeted us warmly, explained their menu selection and the more popular choices. TORCH offers 10 different pressed sushi, with choices of aburi bowls and poke options as well. We ordered salmon, spicy salmon, spicy red snapper, tuna, shrimp, and unagi; we also got complimentary miso and salad for free with the purchase of our sushi. The red snapper is definitely my fav, it has tempura imitation crab within the pressed rice, which gives a nice and pleasing crunch when you bite in! Close second would be the spicy salmon and shrimp. They make all their dressing in-house, which is a nice bonus. The salad dressing was superb; tangy and sweet, with a hint of lemon within. Overall this is a good place more for takeout and on the run lunch/dinner option. However the downside is that without the buy one get one free deal, I feel this place is quite over priced for the quantity of food I'm getting (~$6.70 for 3 pieces and ~$12+ for 6 pieces.) Since this promo goes until the end of the year, I would recommend to try it at least once.",4.0,4.0,39,2017-12-13,43.789482,-79.418195,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
TORCH Pressed Sushi,"I went to Torch on 12/30 before the BOGO free offer expired. I'm so glad I did because I'm not sure if I'd pay full price at TORCH and not because the service is lacking nor because the quality is subpar. Both are great but to pay 20 bucks for 6 pieces of sushi to me is not worth it. I got the regular shrimp, the tempura shrimp, the snapper, and the spicy salmon. The only one I thought was meh was the tempura shrimp because it wasn't as crispy as I wanted my tempura to be. I like the regular shrimp one a lot because it has a burst of freshness from all the lime zest. It really helps to cut some of that butteriness and richness from the spicy salmon and snapper. There's even filling in the pressed rice like shrimp tempura, avocado, and imitation crab meat which takes their pressed sushi to the next level. There aren't many seats inside the establishment so it's better to order it to go. If you're driving to TORCH, there aren't many parking spots available in the parking lot and once you back out of the tiny parking lot you're on Yonge St. It's better to park on the side streets.",4.0,4.0,39,2018-01-03,43.789482,-79.418195,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
TORCH Pressed Sushi,"This place is already becoming quite popular, and I expect it to continue to be. Most of the time, aburi oshizushi is only available at somewhat upscale sit-down Japanese restaurants. Torch is turning that idea upside down, and offering take-out options for their pressed sushi and poke bowls.ATMOSPHERE:It's a tiny little walk in shop with a few stools and standing tables. Enough space for some to sit, but definitely intended as a pick-up option.SERVICE:I had to wait 40+ minutes to get my order, which I was not thrilled with. However, the staff member was sincerely apologetic and friendly. Also, it was somewhat understandable given how busy they were with the buy one get one free special they were offering to celebrate their grand opening. The wait time also suggested to me that they were not willing to compromise quality for speed/convenience, which is a plus for me.FOOD:We ordered the Salmon Pressed Sushi, Spicy Salmon Pressed Sushi, Poke Bowl, and Spicy Salmon Bowl. All were amazing. The salmon for all the dishes were fresh, and seared perfectly. The spicy mayo sauce that accompanied the Spicy salmon bowl went so amazingly well with the sesame seed white rice. The spicy salmon pressed sushi was also quite impressive (yes, I like spicy salmon). VERDICT:I will definitely be back.",4.0,4.0,39,2017-12-30,43.789482,-79.418195,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
TORCH Pressed Sushi,"Not sure if I would really come here without the BOGO discount. I think it's quite pricey for a take out place. However, I thought the sushi was quite good, lots of fish on each piece of sushi. I think there was a tad too much mayo though - a bit less and the fish would have stood out more. I found some sushi was better than others. The shrimp tempera one was alright but not the best (shrimp was small, wasn't torched, would rather eat dynamite roll), the unagi one was not great either (it's alright but nothing special). I would recommend the torched salmon and tuna ones. Those were great!",4.0,4.0,39,2018-01-02,43.789482,-79.418195,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
TORCH Pressed Sushi,"Torch Pressed Sushi is located a bit north of Cummer/Yonge. Parking is quite limited and can be difficult to find. It is also more of a take out joint as there were only around 9-10 bar seats available and no washrooms on site. I came by for lunch on a weekday. The place was quiet but I did notice that several customers came by to pick up their take out orders. The owners were very friendly and attentive. They explained that their most popular torched sushi items were the torched spicy salmon and the torched red snapper; he also stated that the torch shrimp was a lighter item as the shrimp had a citrusy, light flavour to them. The owner also suggested that if I wanted a snack, 3-6 sushi pieces would be ideal, if I wanted to have it as a meal, 9-12 pieces would be recommended depending on how hungry I was. I decided to get 3 pieces of each of the most popular items (spicy salmon, red snapper, and shrimp) and the total came out to around $22. Miso soup was included as well. The owner also gave me a free salad as I had waited a bit longer than usual for my food to be prepared.All three torched sushi items were great! It was up to par with the other torched/aburi sushi places in Toronto. The torched shrimp sushi had a great citrus component to it where the mayo did not overpower the taste and flavour of the shrimp. The torched spicy salmon was just mildly spicy for me and there was a generous amount of salmon in the sushi. Lastly, the red snapper was the surprise out of the three; inside the red snapper sushi there were tempura shrimp and a slight spiciness in the sauce they used. Overall the components of the sushi worked well together making it a delicious bite to eat. Overall, great addition to the neighbourhood, it's great that they offer torched sushi in small amounts (so either 3 or 6 pieces). The food is also made to order so you know that it is being prepared fresh. It is a bit pricey as it adds up so I'd only come back once in a while.",4.0,4.0,39,2018-01-04,43.789482,-79.418195,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
TORCH Pressed Sushi,"Read the reviews and decided to give this a try. When I arrived, they were backloged with orders but not many people waiting. It could be due to soft opening and their bogo offer this month. I decided to order the poke bowl while my friend ordered the spicy torched salmon for takeout.The wait was 30 min but we were warned beforehand. Seems like they are need to reduce the menu selection or get more efficient. In terms of the poke bowl, it was average with salmon and tuna plus a variety of toppings on white rice. My friend was disappointed with his since it only had torched salmon on sushi rice. Not sure if I would return if they wait is that long and they dont improve on the bowls.

We also got 2 miso soups for free with our order. The ratio of fish to rice was perfect, and the combination of ingredients used for each selection was well-paired. I would prefer less mayo for both the tuna and red snapper, as it overpowered the fish. Regardless, it was seared to perfection, fresh and delicious overall. Despite the long 40min+ wait, the owner was sincerely apologetic with customers, and patient and helpful with other staff. The meal was well worth our time and money, as it seemed they placed customer service and quality of food over speed and volume of orders.

TORCH Pressed Sushi,"TORCH is a newly opened little takeout shop featuring aburi oshizushi and don/poke bowls. My girlfriend and I visited during their soft opening promotion (December 13-31), buy one get one free.We ordered their snapper, salmon, spicy salmon, unagi, shrimp, and tuna pressed sushi. For us first-timers, they threw in the TORCH 12 combo special for which we were given free salad and miso soup. The salad consisted of spring greens, sliced cherry tomatoes, and a light citrus based dressing. The owner informed us all sauces and dressings were made in-house. We found the unagi and tuna (pickled onions and wasabi mayo) to be our least favourites as they tasted more aggressive in the sauce, overwhelming the main topping---still not bad at all. Our favourite by far was the snapper. Mayo based dressing, pressed in between the layer of snapper and rice was tempura imitation crabsticks---delicious! Special mention for the shrimp: elsewhere, shrimp pressed sushi is typically paired with just a glob of Japanese mayo, but the flavour was lighter, zestier citrusy in addition to some mayo---a nice change.Overall, well worth the visit at these promotional prices. However, I imagine many people will find it quite steep at regular price and would tend to lean towards say KAKA or VIPS for comparable torched selections. In a pinch for a craving for saucy, smoky/torched fusion-type sushi, it certainly fits the bill. Still, I hope to see more promotions, more combo deals, and perhaps options for customization in the future.",4.0,4.0,39,2017-12-13,43.789482,-79.418195,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"

TORCH Pressed Sushi,"I was very impressed with the quality and effort put into each piece of sushi. TORCH Pressed Sushi specializes in aburi oshi sushi aka pressed sushi, battera or sushi box.

Vegetarian options also include banana and yam and avocado. Hands down, their Red Snapper and Spicy Salmon were to die for. Would highly recommend those.You also have the option of poke bowls but I would suggest you stick with the torched sushi.

The Elm Tree Restaurant,"During my 20 hours in Toronto, I went here for a late work dinner (reservation was for 9pm) on Thursday night. We chose this place because of its proximity to our venue, the Marriott Eaton Centre. The space is cozy and chic, with dim lighting and nice decor. Our group of about 15 were seated comfortably at the long middle table. We ordered cocktails, the Golden Hour and Ginger Cosmo were both hits, as well as a bottle of Pinor Noir. A variety of appetizers were speedily brought to our table, and I enjoyed sampling scallops, octopus, smoked salmon, and beef carpaccio. Oh and how could I forget - the bread came with this AMAZING butter, and when we asked, the staff informed us that it is made with date syrup. I never thought I'd like bread & butter this much!For my entree, I asked our waiter which lamb dish he recommended, and he immediately said the shank. Boy, was he on point. The lamb shank was tender, flavorful, and with a great sauce. Those of us who ordered this devoured it happily.The dessert menu is just as enticing as the food! We ordered a variety to share: pistachio cream, maple cheesecake, chocolate torte, and baklava. The cheesecake was probably my favorite, but each was a delight to try!

No apologies but they wanted to take it back. I didn't want to eat at a different time than my friend so I waited until it was a bit cold and peeled it off the burger. For a high end place, they used iceberg lettuce which wasn't appealing. The bun was toasted and soft which was nice.

Unfortunately, they tasted like watered down wine with a few pieces of citrus in them. Would not recommend. I ordered the lamb shank after reading a bunch of reviews and the creamy sweet potato was delicious and texture was contrasted by the crunchy quinoa. The lamb was perfectly tender without being dry.

The Elm Tree Restaurant,"As a local, I have always avoided restaurants that are fairly close to hotels just on the basis that it ""might"" be an overpriced tourist trap, and hence avoided the area around Elm street. Luckily, a food event brought me to The Elm Tree Restaurant, and I have to say I am a fan of this place!For our dinner, we had a sampling of their winter menu dishes, so we had smaller portions that usual (so ignore the portion size of my pictures). They are now at their Spring menu, but some items will probably still be there.- Pan Seared Scallop: This was perfectly seared and scallop was not overdone. The sunflower seed pesto was great with it, as is the confit tomato.- Beef Carpaccio: This is a great starter and I loved the truffle oil with the beef.- Grilled octopus: I tend to be picky about octopus and hate it when it is not done right. I am happy to say it was quite well done here. Love the giant caper berries and the chorizo salsa with it.- Pork belly: This item has all the other reviews raving about and I can see why. Pork belly needs to be tender to be good and this one is tender! It comes with sauerkraut which is not my favourite, but a good dish nonetheless.- Cornish hen: While not an overly photogenic dish, it is quite decent and I like the roasted brussels sprouts that came with it- Duck breast: This dish was a slight miss for me. While the duck breast is perfectly cooked (pink in centre) and has great flavours with the pistachio rumble and duck jus, the cut of the breast was not good and there was a hard ligament within the meat. It took us a bit of effort to chew. YMMV on this one.- Herb crusted rack of lamb: This was my favourite dish. I loved the combination of the lamb and herb crust, and the parsnip puree was so good with it!Overall, I really liked The Elm Tree Restaurant and the prices are not too bad considering the location (Yonge and Dundas very close to Eaton Centre and TTC; $20 to high 30's for mains).

The service was really great and super friendly - making small talk, telling me about the specials etc.The menu (at least the lunch options) are small - something that I appreciate.  I hate being overwhelmed with too many choices.  I decided on the Duck Risotto, with crispy duck pieces.You do get started with some warm bread and hummus, which is a perfect option to have while you sip on your wine/cocktail.My risotto was pretty much perfection (slightly too salty as I got into eating it, but still delicious).  I only wish there were more of the crispy duck pieces on top - oh my - the flavourful crunch to the softness of the risotto was lovely.  The risotto itself was nice and creamy and had lots of pulled duck meat in it.  It was a decent size portion and I was incredibly sad that the little bit that I had leftover I couldn't pack up and take with me because I was visiting the spa next and there was nowhere for me to store it.I will definitely check out this place again - maybe for dinner.",4.0,4.0,173,2017-03-08,43.657287,-79.383697,"Mediterranean , Modern European"
The Elm Tree Restaurant,"Elm Street is a charming street with a few nice restaurants, all with outdoor seating.  We choose to eat at Elm Tree because the owner greeted us as we walked by and told us we would not be disappointed and we weren't.  I had the Cornish Hen and it was cooked perfectly and had great flavor.  The lamb shank did not disappoint and the beef tenderloin was good.  My friend wanted it cooked medium rare and Miran, our waiter, talked her into getting it cooked medium and she regretted it.  Apparently Canadian's are afraid of under cooked meat. We dined there the day after my birthday and dessert was a gift from Miran.  Thank you.This was one of the best meals we had in Toronto.",4.0,4.0,173,2017-08-31,43.657287,-79.383697,"Mediterranean , Modern European"
The Elm Tree Restaurant,"The place was a close 5-minute walk from Eaton Centre. It was off of a Yonge side street. The restaurant had a dim, dark atmosphere. It's a higher end, more upscale restaurant. The crowd was more for romantic dinners or professional dinners for work.There was complimentary bread with butter to start. The food was unique, with a lot of flavour. However, it was quite oily. It'll give you the runs if you have a weak stomach  =|I got the pork belly. It was a bit too fatty. There weren't many sides. The portion wasn't a lot. It wasn't cheap either, $25 per dish. Lots of alcoholic options. Overall, it was just okay.",4.0,3.0,173,2017-03-07,43.657287,-79.383697,"Mediterranean , Modern European"

The Elm Tree Restaurant,"Made a reservation for ~6:45pm on a Friday and the restaurant was surprisingly only half full. The entrance of this place reminds me a lot of the restaurants in downtown Montreal. Inside, it's dim, mellow, and calm.We were first served with bread and some hummus. I personally love hummus but I know plenty who don't, such as my friend who came with me. Would have been nice if we were offered butter or some other choices.We ordered a cocktail (gin and cucumber), lamb shank, and cornish hen. Hands down the most amazing cornish hen I've ever had. The skin was crispy and flavourful, the meat was tender and juicy. Vegetables provided on the side were delicous too. I loved dipping the hen into the sauce on the plate. Friend's feedback on the lamb was 2.5/5. I tried a piece and agreed with him too. It tasted like any other lamb dish you find at a decent restaurant, nothing stood out. The size of the food is definitely reasonable for what you pay. Both of us could not finish our food.Also, I loved the cocktail! Service was good, we never had to ask for our water to be refilled. Our server came around every 10-15 minutes.The restaunt was quickly filled with people at around 7:30pm. Great spot for a date night!!

The Elm Tree Restaurant,"I came the The Elm Tree for a celebration dinner with my boyfriend. We had made reservations but still had to wait about 20 minutes.. slightly annoying, but fine. We were seated and shared the beef tartare which was yummy but I think the tarragon really threw me off.. my own fault. I got the beef tenderloin and my boyfriend got the rack of lamb. The tenderloin was great although the lamb was a bit over cooked. We also shared a side of seasoned potato wedges which weren't impressive nor dissapointing. The nutella cheesecake however is absolutely delicious and a must try, even if you don't have much of a sweet tooth. Overall I think that the food is good especially for the price, our server was great, and dessert brought this from a 3 to a 4 Star review.",4.0,4.0,173,2017-11-24,43.657287,-79.383697,"Mediterranean , Modern European"
The Elm Tree Restaurant,"I'd like to preface how I chose this restaurant. We were at the Eaton center shopping, and I was on yelp trying to find a vegetarian friendly place that was within our budget. This place popped up as vegetarian friendly (there were 8 of us, and 6 vegetarians). It was a very last minute decision but I called they could accommodate our party, so we went. When I got there, that was the first time I saw the menu which displayed a dinner entree with meat. It was disappointing for some people, but they had to be marked vegetarian friendly for a reason, right? I asked our server who was absolutely a gem, and he let us know that they could prepare certain entrees without the duck jus, etc. We ended up getting food family style instead of traditional one entree per person. A lot of their appetizers and sides were vegetarian, we got one of everything with 2 main entrees - the mushroom risotto and the butternut squash ravioli. If I could do it all over again, I would probably look at their menu before going there and maybe not go with so many vegetarians (they were left disappointed), but I personally enjoyed my experience there!",4.0,4.0,173,2017-05-30,43.657287,-79.383697,"Mediterranean , Modern European"
The Elm Tree Restaurant,"It was a busy night for the restaurant and we appreciate that they gave us a table even though we did not have a reservation. My daughter and I had the cornish hen and the lamb shank, which we shared. Both were perfectly seasoned and cooked and were very enjoyable. Plus the yummy crispy fries. But my favorite part of the meal was the summer salad. It's hard to make a salad with wow factor but this salad had it. The presentation was artistic, the components were a perfect complement, and the dressing had just the right amount of acid and fat. Note that most of the offerings on the menu are rich and heavy - it is not the place to grab a lite dinner.

I wondered if the chickens we ordered were raised in the similar condition .I ordered the 4-piece chicken with french fries. The chicken pieces were alright, but they were overcooked on the edges. One of the pieces was almost burned and did not have any juice in it. The french fries were neither crispy nor flavourful. I cannot comment on the service as I did not get any. In fact, the server accidentally spilled some water on one of my friends while we were waiting.

The Stockyards,"I've been here twice now, my first time being years ago, where I was so disappointed by the BAT I just had to back here to give it another shot and I'm glad I did! I wanted to like this place so badly as everything about it seemed so awesome. It's such a small and lively joint.Came here with a buddy on an early Friday evening for a dine-in and unfortunately the pit smoked chicken and the brisket was already sold out! Okay no problem, the fried chicken was there to save us. We sat across the kitchen, and it was definitely HOT. We were both sweating.I immediately chuckled when I was the fried chicken. It was served on a cast-iron. I'm like how am I going to finish this? But it's so good you won't even have problems. Or you can share it! I recommend doing that.. or do I? So four ginormous pieces of extremely crispy fried chicken. It was some of the juiciest chicken I have ever had. Even the chicken breast, being like two inches thick was juicy the entire way through. Their shoestring like fries were also excellent and there's no shortage of it.The coleslaw was nice and had some real acidity to it. We also ordered ice tea which is the perfect compliment for fried chicken. It's super refreshing and went down well with the fried chicken. I loved the kick of ginger in the iced tea. Service could have definitely been more attentive. I know this is not to be meant as a full service kind of place but I expected just a bit more - we had to ask for utensils and water. The food did take quite a while to be prepared but it was all worth it in the end.

The Stockyards,"Detoured some ways out to dine here, my partner and I had this restaurant on top of our list for a while. Ordered our meal around 7PM. Hoped to order the fried chicken dinner as well as barbecued ribs, but... womp, womp... barbecue isn't a menu option on Thursdays. Ordered the fried chicken dinner between 2 people. You get a 4-piece plate with a more than generous helping of french fries and a side coleslaw salad. The chicken had good flavour and breading and was tender to the bone. The french fries were the best part of the meal... they were well-salted and cooked... however the fries on the dish we were initially served with were obviously out of the fryer for a while, because the server apologized before we had even fully looked over our plate and brought us a freshly cooked side of fries without us even asking. Sadly, the coleslaw was underperforming - easily brought the platter at a 4 down to a 3.5.We chose a pair of bar stools by the window after being ushered to sit where we pleased. After settling the server came to prepare our cutlery and plates. At this point I noticed she wore strong perfume. It seems we caught them on a less than review-ready day because when she arrived with our food, she spilled ketchup onto the counter in front of us, said ""shit"" out loud, and instead of wiping it clean placed a napkin over the spill (it wasn't a just a smidge either...) and placed the side of coleslaw on top of it. I was famished and ready to dig into the food so I tried not to mind, but when she returned to top up our drinks the smell of her perfume literally overcame the taste of fried chicken in my mouth. I had to pause and put the drumstick down until I could no longer smell/taste her perfume. Wasn't horrible service, wasn't good service either.The restaurant is small but cozy so you can eat your comfort food in comfort. On top of it being very dimly lit, we did dine in the evening, so we chose the bar counter by the front window by a table lamp so we could see our food. Mirrors, wooden furniture, and all kinds of charming signs make up the store decor, but the point of focus is the exposed kitchen to gawk over while waiting for your order.In summary, I would not dine here again but my partner says he would. It was an average experience for a just above average plate of chicken.",4.0,3.0,650,2017-10-22,43.681346,-79.426147,"American (Traditional) , Barbeque , Southern"
The Stockyards,"My out of town cousin was up for a visit so I wanted to take her to a place my wife likes called Emma's just down the street from the Stockyards.  Unfortunately Emma's was closed due to renovations for about a week so since we made the trek all the way from the west end to St. Clair and Oakwood I wanted to find a place to have a nice breakfast/brunch.  For so long I've had the Stockyards on my bookmarks list.  I've had friends tell me that I'd like the place because of their fried chicken and I for some reason I never put it together that they were open early enough for breakfast/brunch.  Either way it was a short walk over and I was looking forward to it since I've heard so many good things.The Stockyards is a small footprint.  The seating is basically along the wall, along the front window or at the main counter all stool and bar style.  There's no tables here and the cooking is pretty much done right in front of you as that's the kitchen as well.  It was my first time here so I wasn't sure what to expect as far as the menu but upon entering there is a display of biscuits behind glass to be oohed and awed on.  You see my wife had to work this weekday morning but she loves biscuits.  It's one of the reasons she likes Emma's and since McD's no longer carry biscuits here it's not very easy to find them here in Toronto.  Biscuits are more of a ""southern"" thing.  The USA has them everywhere right?  I mean you can't go to a place that serves breakfast and not find biscuits.  It's like going to a place that serves breakfast that doesn't serve coffee... in the south, it's unheard of really.The menu seemed pretty simple and uncomplicated but I knew I was going to order the chicken and waffles.  The question was I going to order it with 2 pieces or 4?  My cousin ended up going witht the breakfast sandwich which included a deep fried poached egg (Scotch egg?) as well as her choice of sausage or bacon.  I ended up ordering a side of bacon too because well not only do I love fried chicken but I also love bacon.  Oh my, the bacon served here is so thick!  It's like half a centimeter thick!  So good... it's not like any packaged bacon you'll buy at any grocery store.  So of course I'm all about the supersize so I end up ordering the 4 piece.  I didn't even ask what the chicken pieces were going to be because somewhere deep down I assumed it was going to be all dark meat.  Don't get me wrong I like dark meat but I also like white meat.  I'm used to seeing places mostly or exclusively use dark meat for the reason that it's more affordable but also it's typically not as dry as white meat but it's also not as large as white meat pieces either.  Well wasn't it my surprise when the 4 pieces of chicken were served that it was essentially an entire half chicken?  By half I mean breast half, rib and wing half, thigh and drum.  That's 4 pieces, or half a chicken.  Not the dark half or white half but both the dark quarter and the white quarter.  Being that these pieces were a mix it was a LOT of meat and it was more than I was expecting.  The waffle which was freshly made to order was drizzled sparingly (thank you) but let's be honest, the waffle is a compliment to the golden fried chicken which is the feature and reason I ordered what I ordered in the first place.  Wow this fried chicken was amazing.  I mean as far as fried chicken goes it ranks right up there with some the best I've ever had anywhere.  Freshly made and served so it's hot, properly cooked though and though as well as juicy and tasty.  I left nothing on the plate except the bones as it was an absolute pleasure to experience the Stockyard's fried chicken.  Going back to the biscuits, my wife loves them as I said so as far as a to go item I ended up ordering 2 biscuits to bring home so she could have them later in the day.  She told me afterwards that she thought the biscuits were in fact better than Emma's.  That's saying a lot.  She knows and loves her biscuits like I love my fried chicken.  I forgot to mention that The Stockyards has on their menu ""sausage gravy"" in that they're usually served together with biscuits aka ""biscuits and gravy"".  That's totally a southern thing and quite honestly it's the first time I've EVER seen that here in Toronto.  We just don't have that kind of love for biscuits up here like they do down there and white gravy aka sausage gravy?  No, we don't have that item popularized up here at all.  As far as I was concerned until I saw that The Stockyards had it on their menu, I didn't think it existed up here at all.While I like Emma's I can say that I was happy to discover The Stockyards that day.  Their food is great and now my wife wants to try it out as well.  She really missed out that day but she'll get to go soon enough.",4.0,4.0,650,2017-09-27,43.681346,-79.426147,"American (Traditional) , Barbeque , Southern"
The Stockyards,"This review is specifically for a Saturday morning brunch visit. We were warned about the lineups, so we came exactly at 9:00 AM and the place was virtually empty. We basically had the whole place to ourselves for most of our meal, which was probably a huge positive, as the restaurant is pretty narrow and it looks like it could get cramped fast. So note - come early if you want breakfast/brunch and a more relaxing, less-wait-times experience!We ordered The Stockyard (deep fried poached egg with bacon on a buttermilk biscuit) and the Two Egg Breakfast (deep fried poached egg with potatoes, bacon, and toast), with coffee and tea. The quiet ambiance on an early Saturday was definitely a plus, but the meal itself was actually quite good. It was the first time I tried deep fried poached eggs, and the outside crispiness juxtaposed with the runny insides was delicious - the buttermilk biscuit was also really fluffy and tasty!For two people, we paid around $30. It was, overall, a delicious breakfast. Very casual, rustic, with an almost industrial vibe. If you're looking for a fancy Cluny-type brunch or breakfast, this definitely isn't it.

The ribs are smoked for 48 hours and come in gigantic portions. Absolutely colossal in size and smoked to perfection. Although sometimes, the fat content can detract from the experience depending on which piece you get. The ribs tend to be dry rub and packed with spices you won't find anywhere else. BBQ sauce is offered on the side if you require a bit more tang.

My first trip there did not disappoint. The décor, ambiance and service left little more to be desired.For me the food can most simply be described as elevated middle-eastern. Contemporary renditions of classics you'd find in Turkish, Arabic, Israeli and Persian food all wrapped up, refined, and beautifully plated. The biggest hit for me was the braised lamb, tender, rich and saporous. But other can't-miss items included the lamb ribs, mante dumplings, pide and fried couscous. There were a number of other dishes on the menu that jumped out at me, so I may need to return for more.You're not coming here for your souvlaki fix, shawarma plates or a gyro sandwich, but it's a welcome shift from the more traditional Middle Eastern and Mediterranean options that people often associate with the cuisine.",4.0,4.0,571,2018-01-23,43.647434,-79.388193,"Mediterranean , Middle Eastern"

Byblos,This place lived up to everything I heard. It's delicious. This is definitely a place you want to round up a few friends to go with so that you can split all the shared dishes and try as many different options as possible.Go with an open mind and try everything. The only dish I wasn't completely sold on was the pizza/flat bread. Other than that I could eat endless amounts of everything else. The decor was also unique. Be sure to make a reservation in advance. I don't recall seeing them being able to accommodate any walk-ins.,4.0,5.0,571,2017-12-27,43.647434,-79.388193,"Mediterranean , Middle Eastern"
Byblos,"Made an early reservation for 6.30pm on a Saturday for a birthday since it was the only time available until late night, the place was busy but wasnt packed with lots of room between tables to feel spacious. Service was very friendly and nice. We were sat upstairs, it was slightly dark but ambient, with lovely lighting fixtures and comfy seating. Great upscale middle eastern restaurant! We got 4 items and a dessert to share. Started with the House Labneh, tangy cool refreshing creamy and sweet with the honey with warm crunchy bread. Also got the Black Truffle pide, like an elongated pizza, it was warm and cheesy, good amount of toppings and truffle flavour. The Manti Dumplings were delish, the creamy sauce was excellent on the rice. It was savoury, sweet, smokey and creamy at the same time. Texture wise there wasnt much going on but the dumplings were soft, little pillows of yumminess. And lastly got the Sweet Jeweled rice, pilled with lots of crispy fried carrots. This was so good, the rice was flavoured with pops of sweetness from the pomegranate and berries and crunchiness of the nuts. For dessert, we got the Pizzelle, it came with 2 large disks of ice cream dipped in chocolate.  The price wasn't too bad considering we were full and had a little bit of leftover rice to take home. Can't wait to come back and try the other items!",4.0,5.0,571,2017-12-15,43.647434,-79.388193,"Mediterranean , Middle Eastern"
Byblos,"With such an interesting and large menu, you can craft up an amazing dinner with a lot of great flavours.  It's probably one of the most diverse menus I've seen in Toronto and one I'm hoping to try more of... especially with the great service we got here!Near the theatre district, you have this chill and modern vibe where the open prep kitchen lets you see a bit of the foods that gets plated and have you peering over to the near tables to see what great dishes come out. I have to mention that the service here is just incredible... it's not the quiet or bespoke service that I expected but rather it was a warm, friendly, and informative staff that just made this a comfortable and welcoming place.  So if you're worried about dining in this upscale spot... don't be.  This service is just right.As for the food... LOTS of great options but I have to say that these plates are deceiving.  I thought we wouldnt have enough... turns out we probably over ordered.  We definitely could have cut out one dish easily.  They're very filling in a great way.  There are definitely some 'must order' dishes and some otherwise 'decent' dishes.Fried artichoke with labneh - In most people's mind, hummus is one of the first things that come up on a Mediterranean menu.  Byblos doesn't have hummus... they've got something better.  Their labneh is creamier and has a mild tang of the natural yogurt and lemon note that elevates it.  The best part... the fried artichoke that sits on top of it.  It's crispy and perfect as a compliment to the smooth labneh.  Another great part, it comes with a crunchy flat bread that has tons of flavour because of the dose of spices ... perhaps za'atar.  5/5Turkish eggplant manti dumplings - Another delicious dish that brought exceptional flavour.  This one had the smokier eggplant tucked into delicate parcels.  The use of the tangy yogurt and sweetened molasses just complimented everything.  I think we scooped everything including the sauce 5/512 hour braised lamb with assorted sides - This is possibly one of the best lamb i've had in a long time... it is no exaggeration when I say that you can cut the lamb with a spoon.  We honestly did that.  It was so tender and flavourful.. best part, you have a lot of variety of pickles and sauces to add to the lamb in a little wrap.  If I could eat this weekly, I would be a very happy vegetarian (Yes, I'm mostly vegetarian except for dishes like this that happily keeps me trying more meat.  I'm sure it also keeps my dining partner more than happy about that too)  5/5Seared Cauliflower (side) - I think one side dish was more than enough and between the two... the seared cauliflower was the stronger one.  Though it was cooked in duck fat, I didnt taste any of the savoriness of it.  The tahini sauce did rescue this one from being too boring.  3.5/5Roasted Brussel Sprouts (side) - This was cooked well (not raw) but it was just a little more mundane and less flavourful compared to the previous dishes.  It would be hard to compete with the lamb or dumplings but it's a green... and I like my vegetables but this one I could have done without.  3/5Pavlova - So check out my video on this dish and you'll see why I say that this dessert is all about theatrics.  Whimsical, fun, and interesting presentation ... it doesnt stop there.  It also tastes very very good too.  Strawberry flavour bursting out and the pavlova bits isn't overly sugary.  I can easily order this again and again.  Definitely one of the most memorable desserts I've had all year  5+/5  Seeing how we went to Bar Sybanne the week before and had a great meal there... it was interesting to compare it to Byblos.  Both are excellent for their respective takes on the Mediterranean flavour.  They both have excellent service and atmosphere... if anything, they're both quite alike there.  For the food, Byblos brings a better menu and presentation.  It also costs nearly double of Bar Sybanne.  I would say that both are deserving to try and enjoy... maybe Byblos would be a special occasion instead of your great weekend spot.",4.0,4.0,571,2017-11-26,43.647434,-79.388193,"Mediterranean , Middle Eastern"
Byblos,"Lovely spot for dinner or a fancy lunch. Memorable dishes were the Crispy Baby Artichoke dish with housemade labneh, preserved lemon and olive oil The truffle rice was so luxurious with foraged mushrooms and crème fraîche pockets that bursted in your mouth. Turkish Manti Dumplings with smokey eggplant and yogurt sauce had the perfect smoky:creamy ratio. The way the interior designers embraced the lofty space which still keeping it super modern, yet opulent, is very impressive. Service was on point. Attentive, but never intrusive.

Byblos,"This place never fails. We first came here 3 years ago and every trip back has also been just as good as we remembered.The first time we came here, we managed to get a table upstairs even though it was just for two people. We haven't been seated upstairs again. We've been told that it's only for large parties. It is quite posh upstairs. Don't get me wrong, downstairs is nice too, but I would still like to figure out how to get back up there without going out with a large group. We've come here quite often over the years, but after Yunaghi closed last year, this has been where we go for various celebratory reasons. We usually get two or three starers, two ""to share"" items, a rice, and several drink each. And if you think that sounds like a lot of food...yes, you are correct. We always think, why do we always order so much food? Why didn't we save room for dessert? The old Vietnamese saying 'Con mt to hn cái bng' explains this the best: our eyes grew bigger than our tummies. Everything on the menu became something we wanted, we'd order and not realize that we would have to eat it too.The olives are always a good way to start here. We love the eggplant kibbeh with chickpea batter and yoghurt--the chickpea and yoghurt are so delicious. To share, we've tried pretty much all of the different fish dishes. My favorite remains the black cod. I noticed that a few reviews noted that theirs came out too dry, or overcooked, or the leaves were burnt. We've never had that problem though. The fish is wrapped, and so it remains tender and delicious. I love things wrapped in vine leaves. We usually also get black truffle rice, but the sweet jeweled is lovely as well. Oh yeah, I guess we also usually order a side of the roasted brussels sprouts as well. 1) Yes, I know...who eats brussels sprouts? Well, we do..we're not little kids and we happen to love brussels sprouts. 2) Yes, it does add more food to what is already a lot.Everything is fragrant here and the spices hit all the right notes. The drinks only make it better. I always order the business man (never fails), however to be honest, I actually don't like it as much as any of the other drinks on the menu.  It just sounds like a really manly drink, and so I get it without remembering I don't like it. It usually means that the Mrs. finishes it for me while I get hers =)",4.0,5.0,571,2017-12-29,43.647434,-79.388193,"Mediterranean , Middle Eastern"

Byblos,"This is a very nice upscale Middle Eastern restaurant. We came here for dinner on a Wednesday night and it didn't seem too crowded, but I'd recommend making a reservation to be safe. The service staff was all very friendly, and the ambiance was nice.Two important prefaces before getting to the food. First, come with friends. Everything is designed to be shared, so it's best if you have a party of 2-4. This will let you enjoy a nice variety of dishes. Second, you get what you pay for, so expect to spend ballpark $75 per person (assuming a good-sized meal and 1 drink per person).Now to the food: the dishes were all very good, though obviously some more so than others. Pretty much everything was cooked and seasoned exceptionally well. Many of our dishes had a lot of sour dairy (e.g. yogurt), which I wasn't a big fan of - but if you like that, then you're in business. I really really enjoyed the black truffle pide and the roasted lamb shoulder (amazingly done). The persian kale rice was also quite good. I usually love brussels sprouts, but I was unfortunately a bit disappointed with the ones here (I would've liked them more roasted and with less yogurt). The labneh and the eggplant kibbeh were both nice appetizers, if you like those things. Lastly, the drink menu was very good (unless you like beer - they pretty much only do wine, cocktails, and spirits).Overall, we had a very nice time. Due to the high price, it's not the kind of place I'd go very often.

Byblos,"I've always heard amazing things about this place and decided to bring my man here for his bday! We were not disappointed and honestly, I was excited about the place because it offered something different as an upscale Mediterranean restaurant. My first thoughts walking into the restaurant was that the place was intimate, has a very nice ambiance and thumbs up for the open kitchen concept. In fact,I found myself getting distracted watching the chefs plating food. As a tapas place, they recommended 5 dishes for two people but we opted for 4. We tried the creamed spinach pide, turkish manti dumplings, truffle rice and the short rib kebab. All the dishes were exquisitely plated, flavourful but refined. Honestly, I loved all the dishes and would recommend them all. For dessert, we opted for the pavlova which was nice to end off the meal. The pavlova was served in a very interesting meringue ball which they had to crack open to reveal the equivalent of a strawberry shortcake. I loved the sorbet! Overall, I totally get the hype and would definitely come again. Service, food and atmosphere really speaks for itself.",4.0,4.0,571,2017-11-18,43.647434,-79.388193,"Mediterranean , Middle Eastern"
Byblos,"Food wise, they're doing a decent job here. It doesn't feel like a classically trained Middle Eastern chef doing fusion, it feels like a classically trained caucasian chef doing Middle Eastern fusion food. The result in my opinion is a playful and creative menu, but the dishes often stray too far from their original concept or have a severe balance issue - heavy handed on spices, too much sweetness, bitter finishes, and so on.There are certainly some standout dishes, but the experience is really soured by poor service, that just doesn't match the price point, and seems to be getting much worse with time. For the few times i've been here since 2016, I've been disappointed by arrogant servers, poor timing, lack of simple service expectations like clearing plates and glasses, topping up wine, etc. The style of service is also rather rushed, with dishes appearing whenever they're ready, with little thought given to what's already on the table, or what needs to be paired, etc. Overall, I'm done with Byblos. I give them kudos for their creativity but the food needs work and service will keep me away. There is however, so much potential here. It's of no surprise to me that the restaurant didn't make it either in a Middle Eastern market (in Dubai), shutting it's door in under a year after open (in Dubai Byblos was called Morah due to a trademark issue).

On our most recent trip we had the labneh to start (in fact we get this one every time we go), the chanterelle mushroom wood fired flatbread, Persian kale rice, black truffle rice and New Zealand Snapper (which was a special).

Byblos,"Byblos was crowded, on Tuesday evening! We did not see one empty table, which must give you an indication of the quality of the restaurant, even though it has been open for the best part of four years. Our experience was good, though with the odd poor spot.Some measure of the quality is indicated by the crispy sesame encrusted and lemon fragrant bread which comes to start.We had the crispy artichokes which were a real delight, warm with a sweet element and plenty of them. As our waiter recommended, we had the eggplant kibbeh - beautiful, soft, fragrant. The chanterelles flatbread was a complete disappointment - very salty, hardly tasting of chanterelles  and otherwise indifferent.The octopus were tender and good tasting but rather overpowered by a Piri Piri like sauce. The rack of lamb was cold, and certainly not worth the $42 pricetag. The cauliflower and brussels sprouts veggies were great and well worth trying even if they were a bit salty.Service was polished, professional, and informed.The wine list is comprehensive, we had a wonderful Sancerre for$90, followed by a Cote de Nuits ($125).

The drink had an arousing scent due to flowers and taste better than it looked. We ordered from the ""SHARE"" side of the menu which would give us an opportunity to try several different dishes. The Middle Eastern Fried Chicken - I really don't know what I expected, but this was delicious. All parts of the chicken was fried into little balls and served with a red schug hot sauce. Just magnificent!Crispy Hand Rolled Couscous - This is the best couscous I have had in my life. It consisted of collards and halloumi. I could have had several orders of this stuff. It was excellent. The Lamb Rack - Initially, the rack was brought out rare and we had to send it back. Once they brought it back cooked medium as we requested. The lamb was well seasoned, tender and juicy. Thrice-Cooked Fries - The dipping sauce for the fries is what made them unique. They were very good as well. Pizzelle - This was a very good way to finish the meal. This dessert is baklava ice cream, salted caramel and couscous praline. The look of the dessert reminds you of a Neapolitan ice cream sandwich. We had to let it soften up a little, but it was heavenly.

Sabai Sabai Kitchen and Bar,"I'd been meaning to check out Sabai Sabai for a really long time, so when the opportunity arose to finally check the place out, I leapt at the opportunity.We arrived for a 7:15 reservation and the place was packed. We were seated between two other tables and it was a tight squeeze, to be sure. (I'd guess there was about five inches between the tables.) There's nothing fun about this intimate of a seating arrangement, but if this food's good, it's usually easy enough to overlook.I decided to go with the Street Style Tossed Noodles (""rice noodles, chicken, peanut, tamarind sauce, bean sprouts"") and I asked for them extra spicy, to which I was told that they don't touch the spice in the individual dishes but that they can bring me out hot peppers and hot sauce. Weird, but okay.It arrived shortly after and the dish itself is pretty good. There are some bold flavors going on here and the accompanying hot peppers and sauce provide a decent amount of heat. The whole thing might have been a little too saucy for my liking, but it's a tasty concoction.There was, however, one big problem: the dish wasn't hot when it arrived to the table. It wasn't even warm. It was closer to room temperature, which, honestly, I have no idea how they managed. The almost infuriating lack of heat definitely affected my enjoyment of the dish pretty significantly.I have to assume this was a mistake somewhere along the line, but it seems highly unlikely I'll ever return to find out.",4.0,2.0,171,2018-01-20,43.670453,-79.384722,"Laotian , Thai , Vegan"

The presentation of the Mee Kati Noodles was interesting but impractical.  It had the sauce and chicken separate in a little cup.  Since the rice noodles began sticking to each other after it's removed from water, it made mixing the sauce and noodles very difficult.  A lot of the chicken and nuts were at the bottom of the plate instead of mixed in with the noodles.My friend's fried rice was also disappointing.  The rice was undercooked, which was why it was so crunchy and powdery.",4.0,3.0,171,2017-11-19,43.670453,-79.384722,"Laotian , Thai , Vegan"

Sabai Sabai Kitchen and Bar,"Dinner with a friend here at the very very busy location just east of the Yonge and Bloor intersection. You can find the entrance down the small flight of stairs below the Firkin.Toronto was bracing for one of the chilliest nights ever seen on record (-34 celsius) so some warm and delectable Northern Thai food was a good choice.  Highly recommend putting in a reservation otherwise the wait for a walk-in table may be a bit long.  I guess you can always grab a pint or two upstairs at the Firkin to pass the time.  I'm happy that we had a reservation for the night.Just a note that during winter, sitting near the front of the restaurant can get a little chilly with the door opening and closing all the time.  They have a thick curtain to help shield people from the cold but it works best when there isn't a constant foot traffic through.  The large floor-to-ceiling window at the front of the restaurant isn't insulated either so you could feel a bit more of a chill sitting towards the front.We had quite the feast for a table of 3.  We ordered two appetizers and three mains.  This was the recommended amount of food by our really friendly and attentive server. The lightly-fried and breaded garlic shrimp were crunchy and had a nice little savoury tamarind dipping sauce to pair with it.  I wasn't a big fan of the laap lao (minced pork lettuce wrap).  It was a little bit watery and lacked a bit of flavour even though it had some minced child peppers in it.  Glad I tried it thought.Entree were a shared trio of drunken noodles, massaman curry, and the khao soi.  All three were definite hits and they went down a storm.  The braised beef was super tender and the slightly sweet curry over some rice was great.  My star of the night was the khao soi with the bowl of rich and thick golden curry and the egg noodles floating within.We were told earlier that our reservation would only be for about 1hr 15min as there would be another reservation following us for the table.  We stayed about 10 minutes over our time but there was no pressuring for us to eat faster or settle the bill pre-emptively.it's an excellent solid choice for some Thai food in the heart of the downtown core.  Again, I would recommend booking a reservation if you come here on a weekend.",4.0,4.0,171,2018-01-10,43.670453,-79.384722,"Laotian , Thai , Vegan"

Squash fritters were thin, crispy, and came with a delicious soy/peanuty dipping sauce. Khao soi was exactly like pics and had good flavour. I think my fav was the pad gra prao with pork, which had a delicious spicy kick.

Sabai Sabai Kitchen and Bar,"Delicious! The curries are what you should definitely order here. The service was great and they also have an extensive vegan menu. We recommend to reservations, the restaurant was packed by 5:30! However, we felt the portions were a little too small for the price. We ordered:- Massaman curry with sticky rice. The curry was rich, and flavourful, but the sticky rice was hard in a way that it didn't taste fresh.- Khao Sol with beef (golden curry) was our favourite! Rich in flavour with a good amount of noodles. You should definitely order this!- Drunken noodles (Pad Kee Mao) to our surprise was plated in a tiny bowl. The noodles were all sticking together and tasted subpar.- Lao BBQ Chicken (Ping Gai) was very tender. However it was a small piece of chicken, but into 4 pieces.

Sabai Sabai Kitchen and Bar,"Visited Sabai Sabai once at it's original location before they moved. This is a better location as it is more spacious to accommodate more people.  We (2 of us) waited for about 25 mins before we get seated on a Tuesday night.  Food : We order a couple dishes to share as we were starving.  Squash Fritters were good.  Lao style chicken wings were ok, they were honey glazed with a hint of spiciness.  Mee Kati Noodles was interesting as the sauce was served on the side with the rice noodles. You can pour the sauce onto the noodles as desired.  Green curry chicken with sticky rice was my favourite dish.  The curry was flavourful with a bit of heat which I enjoyed.  The portions were a bit small but they were tasty.  Service : HORRIBLE.  I know we were not eating at a fine dine restaurant but the service here felt worse than dining at a chinese restaurant.  We waited a good 20 mins for our entrees after we finished our appetizers. During this time our server disappeared and no one ever came around to refill water for us nor check on us.  The restaurant was busy but not at full capacity. It was a mission to track our server down to ask him for water refills.  After the food came, the server again disappeared and never checked up on us until we pretty much cleared our plates.  Isn't that a little late to ask if we are okay with the food? Overall, the food were good but we were disappointed with the service at the new location.  Not sure if they are not used to the increase in the restaurant volume or what not, but the servers need to be more attentive to their customers.",4.0,3.0,171,2017-11-29,43.670453,-79.384722,"Laotian , Thai , Vegan"
Sabai Sabai Kitchen and Bar,"Food was good but not enough substance. I got the vegan parang curry and it was mostly liquid and very little vegetables and tofu.

If large crowd they'll give you your own table which is better. Lastly the noise level in this restaurant is off the charts and I'm not usually one to complain about noise but I found it extremely difficult to have a lengthy conversation or catch up when you need to yell over other voices in the restaurant.

Little did I know that during my time away from Toronto, they moved to (in my opinion) a much better location. During my time back in the city, I had the opportunity to dine here for dinner on a Saturday.There was a wait, however my parents did the smart thing and reserved beforehand. We were promptly seated and given our menus (and water). We tried several dishes, including the crispy fried fish, grilled satay chicken, grilled beef salad, mee kati noodles, street-style tossed noodles, and a tom yum goong soup. Everything was excellent except the crispy fried fish, which in my opinion was still good but nothing special. Particular standouts were the grilled satay chicken and both noodles; their skewers were very juicy and the noodles were cooked perfectly.The environment was loud and bustling, and the service was excellent.

Service was decent; however, we were informed when we got there that there was another reservation after us at 7:30pm and our seating was only for 1.5 hours, even though our email specifically stated that for those with party of 5+, seating is for 2 hours.  We told the hostess and wait staff about this a few times and although they stated that they could not guarantee that we could keep our seating past 7:30pm, we were lucky and the other reservation must have been seated elsewhere.The food was good and great for sharing and trying various dishes. However, if you were to order your own dish without sharing plates, then the portions may seem somewhat small.   They also have an extensive vegan section on their menu.  We tried several dishes, including panang curry, pad thai, khao soi, squash fritters, stir-fried eggplant, papaya salad, and pad gra prao with pork.  Everything was decent.  Khao soi, squash fritters, pad gra prao and pad thai (in that order) were probably my favourite.  I've tried better khao soi at similar Thai places, but this place was still fairly decent and I'd order it again.It gets quite busy on a Tuesday night, so make sure you make reservations ahead of time!",4.0,3.0,171,2017-11-15,43.670453,-79.384722,"Laotian , Thai , Vegan"

I wanted more punch -Some spice or citrus but nothing came through. I ultimately dipped the left over fish in the khao soi curry. That made it better.

I thought the flavour was nice - meaty and spicy but not too overwhelming. My friend thought it was blandC-momo (beef) - their spicy dumplings. Each dumpling was huge and stuffed to the brim. It came in a red spicy sauce which added tons of flavour. I tried without sauce and it was still tasty and flavourfulChili chicken - I know why it's such a hit with the crowd. it came with rice, a fried meat dumpling (2nd best), a steam bun to soak up all the gooey goodness of the chili chicken, and soup of the day. All this, only for 12$!!  The chicken was so flavourful and it was spicy. in my experience, spicy food from restaurants are never spicy and i always have to ask for additional hot sauce.  but this place delivered everything - from spiciness to quality to the friendliness/helpfulness of staff.highly recommend!",4.0,5.0,178,2018-01-15,43.640015,-79.43962,"Himalayan/Nepalese , Asian Fusion , Indian"
Tibet Kitchen,"Another great Tibetan meal at Queen St. W. We actually had an aim to eat at Himalayan Kitchen that Saturday night, but they were randomly shut. Tibet Kitchen was just a few steps away and looked pretty busy, so we thought this was a sign for us to try another new restaurant of the same cuisine. By far the most friendliest service compared to Shangrila and Himalayan Kitchen. The only reason I did not give this place a 5 stars was because they do not serve thali for dinner. So we started off with veg momo's, which were delicious, but I still say Shangrila make the best momo's.For mains I got the large dhal with rice and my friend got the tofu and broccoli curry with tingmo. Surprisingly, the tofu wasn't deep fried, which is a good thing. However, the portion size was pretty tiny. My dhal arrived, which for a large, wasn't that ""large"". Also the dhal was made using a different lentil compared to the dhal from the other aforementioned restaurants, where they used the yellow lentils rather than the black ones. It was really flavourful though, and with the rice, it was really comforting for a cold night. Overall, the food tasted great and the restaurant itself was well decorated with some effort put into it (such as the addition of a large Dalai Lama painting). The portion sizes need to be enhanced and they should consider serving thali for dinner instead of only lunch.

Tibet Kitchen,"Came by here (commuted over 2 hours) because I heard they had the BEST CHILI CHICKEN....nope. Not even close. My friend and I found it to have no spicy and little flavour at all. Originally, I thought we must have gotten the wrong item but looking at photos, it looks right. We were expecting the chicken to be crispy as I read in some reviews, however, our dry chili chicken was SOGGY. It was actually the worst chili chicken Ive ever had... I would reccomend this place in Scarborough on pharmacy (forgot the name), or chili chicken house in Mississauga. Try making chili chicken at home too. My mom's is much better than this place. Other menu items/highlights :- gyuma blood sausage appetizer: DELICIOUS MUST TRY ITEM. It was my first time trying blood sausage or blood anything. Had no idea what I was putting in my mouth but everything including the onions were a delight. The sauce was sososo good! - ginger garlic bok Choy had a great tasting sauce- was not expecting a huge bowl of steamed rice. We ordered a fried rice bowl and ended up not eating much of the plain rice or finishing the fried rice. It looked like they used different grains of rice. - tibet fried rice was better than expected, tastier than the basic Chinese fried rice that it basically looks like- service: okay...

And a very, very extensive beer menu.When you walk up the stairs to this mid-level dining room, you'll immediately notice the high-quality, dense wood assembled bench/pic nic seating and tables. It's like a mess hall but much nicer and with way better quality food. There is a wide variety of different sausages of course (you may have guessed from the name :D). This is not your frozen meat section at Safeway, this isn't even the counter st your favorite butcher shop, this is made-in-house homemade not from a supplier legit you won't find it anywhere else sausages, and the quality is very freakin' good! They let you choose everything from how its dressed, to the bun to sides and how it's cooked, and then you choose the drink to go along with it. For those who need to drive afterwards, there's a good supply of Italian soda and flavored waters and juices on hand, and for those who's palate is in need of some fresh suds, the aforementioned beer list is there for your continued enjoyment. There's not much to complain about in regards to the beer, the only thing I would warn newcomers of is that scattered throughout the list are some rare and imported selections which can go as high as $40-80, if memory serves correctly. Should you not be careful, you may order one by accident and be very surprised when the bill arrives (although I am fairly certain the staff would advise you of such a thing happening should you do so accidentally).Food is served pretty quickly, staff is friendly.

They serve a bunch of different kinds of sausage, fries, and soft pretzels. I ordered an Italian sausage (with peppers and onions), soft pretzel with Dijon mustard, and a sparkling glass of red wine. Everything was amazing and pricing was pretty good. However if you are super hungry, I'm not sure if this would fill you up. That being said, I really enjoyed this place and would definitely return with a bunch of friends for a night out!",4.0,5.0,622,2017-12-30,43.644186,-79.401015,"German , Bars"
Wvrst,"I recently had lunch with my friend at Wvrst. It has hip communal seating and soft lighting from the Christmas lights hung on the ceiling.  The overall ambiance here is welcoming and it is perfect for groups as well as diners who come alone. The gimmick for me here are the gamey meats. Wvrst caters a host of sausages made from meats that are not commonly found in restaurants in the GTA.  For example, they have elk, bison, pheasant, and even kangaroo sausages. Unfortunately, when I tried the kangaroo sausage, it didn't taste very distinct from regular beef or pork sausages. Maybe I should have gotten the elk sausage as I've heard from several others that the elk has the most distinct gamey flavour.  At the very least the sausages here are juicy and every bite will be crispy and hot (in temperature).  My friend and I also shared a side of duck fat fries. Unfortunately, they were very underwhelming.  They tasted like regular fries that were extra oily, and the kimchi mayo that came with them was rather bland. They were nothing special to write home about in all honesty. However, I will admit that I love the selection of condiments. They have honey mustard, Dijon mustard, ketchup and, my personal favourite, the garlic sauce. I usually don't see honey mustard and garlic sauce at hot dog vendors, so I was stoked. Whip them onto your hot dog and you're golden! I think Wvrst has a lot of potential that I haven't experienced first-hand. Currently, nothing really hooks me, but I'm sure I will find it more enjoyable when I try a few more items in the future (Eg. The elk meat and the pretzels). I will update my review then.",4.0,3.0,622,2017-11-11,43.644186,-79.401015,"German , Bars"
Wvrst,"There has to be a bad line or joke here about a sausage party?  ... am I the only one? Okee then.So Wvrst is every carnivore & beer lover dream.  Really.  A cool beer hall that has an overwhelming choice of beer and cider(we're talking easily 40+ of different types not including all the crazy bottle offering) PLUS at least 20+ options of sausages.  And I haven't even mentioned the side options either.  I've been in a few beer halls around the world and I was surprised to see this in Toronto... it's has a modern and hip edge but the focus isnt only the aesthetics.  It does bring the goods on flavour too.  A note to all... dont expect your own space, its allll communal tables and in true beer hall style, that's a good thing.  They did have probably 5 large sections just for big parties that reserved ahead of time (aka. bachelor parties or birthdays). The menu for drinks is huge... I almost feel it's overwhelming.  They do offer flights for beer and cider.  Go for it... take my word for it and discover a brand new favourite.  Worse case I guess you could get stuck with something like raspberry beer.  The nice thing is that their flight cost is not obscene and I think its a great value. As for the food menu, you want to sink your teeth into everything if you're the type to carve meat of all kinds.  They dont just do the safe typical meats of chicken, beef, or pork.  Ohhh they do things like venison, kangaroo, bison, wild boar, and even VEGAN!  On top of all that choice, you go after some vegetables (cause I always do that... order vegetables at a meat focused place), DUCK fat fries (amen to that), and pickles!  Elk Sausage - With game meats, you never know how it is till its right in front of you.  This one was not gamey at all... no stink or tough chewiness.  The cumin flavour was nice with elk meat.  Though it was dry, flavour was quite good.  4/5 Wild Boar Sausage - Another game meat option and this one wasn't as flavourful as the Elk.  It tasted like pork with a bit more umami.  Compared to the Elk, this wasnt as dry but it wasn't as tasty.  3.5/5Dirty Duck Fries - I love great crispy duck fries ever since I had them in UK.  So finding a great version in Toronto would be amazing.  I would say the toppings of onions, peppers, and jalapeno, and the wvrst sauce was nice but the fries didnt stand out as crispy or well seasoned.  It was a solid option but not quite the ones Ive had in the UK.  3.5/5Small Salad - For a side salad, this is a great option and for once, a really reasonable price.  I know i know... who orders salad at a bierhalle ... I DO and I'll do it again.  I liked how it was dressed ... not too much and had a good balance of acidity.  4/5Pickles - we got the cauliflower, garlic dill, and chili carrots.  This is a good selection that breaks out of the norm for most places.  I wouldnt necessarily pick up the same items again but I would definitely try other ones 4/5Pumpkin Spice Soft serve - They jumped the bandwagon on it and though I didnt find a lot of spice to it, I did find it had a definite pumpkin taste to it.  It wasn't icy but it was fairly creamy.  3.5/5Overall, I loved the atmosphere and I think it would be a great spot for a group to just hang out while enjoying some very good food.  Definitely try the game meats! you'll be surprised how tasty they really are!",4.0,4.0,622,2017-11-02,43.644186,-79.401015,"German , Bars"
Wvrst,"Wvrst is pretty much Toronto version of Wurstküche in Los Angeles - a German bar with an exotic selection of sausages and banquet style tables. What do I mean by ""exotic""? Guineafowl, pheasant, duck, venison, merguez, bison, wild boar, elk, rabbit, and kangaroo (you heard it right - Kangaskhan ... I mean kingaroo). There are also gluten-free, vegan, and traditional sausages available. To order, you first select a meat and follow by either picking two toppings on a toasted bun (sweet sauteed onions, sauerkraut, sauteed jalapenos, sweet peppers, or giardiniera - extra CAD $2.25) OR selecting the currywurst style (sliced sausage served with country bread and tomato curry sauce). Once you place your order, just grab your number and the staff will come find your table.Parking: I don't really want to know how much I have paid for public parking during my stay in Toronto ... I had to pay CAD $15 (Friday and Saturday from 6 PM to 6 AM) at the Indigo parking lot (75 Portland Street M5V 2M9 Toronto Ontario CA) and it is just a block away from the bar.***Kangaroo (fine herbs; sweet pepper and jalapeno on a toasted bun, CAD $9.75): Sausage tasted somewhat plain, but at least I like kangaroo better than veal.***Overall a 3.5-star, but bump up to 4-star due to the fun and socializing vibes.",4.0,4.0,622,2017-11-24,43.644186,-79.401015,"German , Bars"
Wvrst,"Impressive selection of sausages and beer! (not that kind of sausage!)I tried their Game Sausage - Guinea Hen for $9.50. They add 2 toppings; their giardiniera/pickled veg is worth a try ($2 extra). Although it was pretty good, my only complaint is that this is a bit pricey for sausage on a bun. I regret not trying the fries. Their range of beers was even more impressive. There were hundreds of dark, wheat, malt, hopped and pale beers, ciders, wines ... more choices than you can wrap your head around.Great casual atmosphere, but can get crowded and loud.

So yeah this place doesn't look Canadian but it has some great stuff so I figured why not. I love that the interior looks like a giant German Oktoberfest hall. All the tables are communal so you are encouraged to be social. The atmosphere is very friendly and bright. It's mainly a beer scene but their sausages are delish. I ordered a pheasant sausage (apple and sundried tomato) with sweet peppers and sauerkraut, all for $9.75. I also got duck fat fries (5.75) and smoked gouda (4.75) on top. I was allowed one dip so I chose chives and roasted garlic. Total with tax was ~$22 but it was delicious. The pheasant was steaming hot so be careful! It had a light gamey flavour and the texture was not too tough to chew. Very flavourful indeed. The sausage could be served in a white bun (which I got) or with curry. The fries were delicious but SUPER salty, and it might be a ruse to get you to try their beer. I had to buy water from a convenience store after. Anyway, they were a little burnt but otherwise very good and potatoey. My friend said she never saw such thick fries (and she's American) and was happily surprised. She couldn't finish her regular fries. I managed to finish all mine. I would definitely come back again to try their other game sausages.

This ran be nearly $30 with tax I believe. Don't shy away just because of this though, but keep it in mind! Personally, I want to come back and try at least four more different types of sausages, and some dirty fries. The fries plus sausage combo is filling, so don't worry about needing to get more food.Inside, it kind of feels like a cafeteria in terms of there being long connected tables that you can sit down and eat at with your friends. When you order, you're given a number stand and the food will be delivered to wherever you decide to sit.

The round tables that run down the centre should not be there, as it's a small place and it brings the place down a notch.It was two of us on a Tuesday morning around 11:15 a.m. There were two other tables seated when we walked in. We ordered coffee, juice and eggs Benny, all at the same time, but the eggs never arrived. We sipped coffee and juice for forty-five minutes slowly, meticulously saving some for our breakfast, sitting patiently, watching the restaurant fill to capacity. Eventually the server noticed our table needed some attention. He jauntily asks, ""where are your eggs?"" I thought he was joking at first, since we were wondering the same thing ourselves, for the last forty-five minutes, Toronto-style, politely assuming they'll be here any second now. He returns from the kitchen and casually asks, ""are you in a rush?""It's a good thing he was looking at my guest's face instead of mine. With apologies, he explains that, although he took our order, 45 minutes ago, he was remiss in sending it in to the kitchen, [or even taking noticing for that matter.] The restaurant was now at capacity and our now lunch, would be lucky to arrive by mid afternoon. I had a birthday party planned for that evening with a list-full of errands to run, and guests to accommodate, so no, we were not going to be polite Toronto-style.

Omai Restaurant,"This restaurant on Baldwin street is not the easiest to find as the sign is discreet. Upon entering, you feel the hip and relaxed vibe. Service was attentive, the warm sake recommended by our server was quite delicious and much needed on a cold winter evening, and overall, the food was good. Although we were very impressed with their kitchen menu, the temaki, which we had high hopes for, was a let down. We found the rice in the temaki to be slightly dry, which was a big a disappointment. We tried the red sea bream, tamago and octopus temakis. Overall, the combination of ingredients in each temaki and flavours were good, but the drier rice didn't leave us wanting more. From the kitchen menu, we tried the following dishes:- Yu Choy ($7) - A common way to cook yu choy, a Chinese leafy green vegetable, is to blanch it quickly and serve it with oyster sauce. This is a much fancier version, with the yu choy served on top of a light dashi broth, complimented with a cashew miso butter. We didn't find this dish special as the cashew miso butter didn't have much flavour, although the presentation was nice.- Croquette ($9) - The fried butternut squash and creamy oka cheese had a nice melt in your texture. Although we enjoyed the dish, we didn't really taste the nori in the aioli, which we felt would have added that nice umami punch if the flavour was stronger.- Sunomono ($11) - The vinaigrette in this dish was very refreshing and we really liked the ingredient combination. The octopus was tender, and the cucumber and zucchini added some texture to the dish. - Chicken Liver Pate ($12) - The addition of the orange blossom honey to the chicken liver pate was very creative and it really elevated the flavours with the sweet and tangy notes. This was one of our favourite dishes.- Pork Belly ($14) - This was definitely our favourite dish for the evening. The skin on the pork belly was crispy, yet the pork belly itself literally melted in our mouths. The dish was also balanced in flavour and the sunchokes added a nice earthy and nutty taste.- Beef Cheek ($16) - The beef cheeks were really tender and the persimmon added a nice sweetness.Overall, we really enjoyed the kitchen menu, especially the hot food. There is a lot of potential here, but as mentioned above, the slightly dryer rice in the temakis was a huge disappointment as we were expecting these to be more of the highlight for our meal.",4.0,4.0,17,2018-01-16,43.656116,-79.392384,Japanese
Omai Restaurant,"Came here on a Thursday evening for the very first time and was seated at the bar area. There were three of us and we each ordered 3 rounds of Temaki (hand rolls). From the selection of 7 types of hand rolls, I was able to try three: Ganpyo, Tamago, and King Salmon. My personal favourite out of the three would be the Tamago which has sweet egg and truffle. The aroma of the truffle fills your mouth when you bite into the hand roll, even the person sitting next to you can smell the truffle. It was delicious. The Ganpyo consisted of daikon (winter radish), avocado, and sesame. If you like refreshing and crunchy fillings, this hand roll is for you. The King Salmon was okay, nothing too special. Although the menu states that there's maple flavour along with daikon, all you really taste is the salmon. You can barely taste the maple. From the kitchen menu, we ordered the Croquette, Fried Chicken, Soon Dog, and Bavette Steak to share. The croquette was deep fried to perfection with a butternut squash and oka cheese filling with a nori aioli on the side. The fried chicken was seasoned with house spices served with ramp aioli. It was a little on the salty side for my liking. As for the soon dog, which is blood sausage, sake steam bun, plum mustard, and sage chips, the bun was a little hard. I personally don't like eating intestines and organs, so I didn't really enjoy eating it, but the sage chips on the side were really good. They were thinly sliced and tasted even better than Lays original flavoured chips. Lastly, the bavette steak was probably the highlight of the entire meal. The steak was cooked medium rare and was very tender and juicy. It was grilled with kalbi butter and served with roasted eggplant and garlic chips and wasabi. This restaurant is fairly new to Baldwin street and it already quite popular, so if you plan on coming, I'd recommend making a reservation as seats as limited. The quality of the photos I'd be sharing will be comprised as the lighting in the restaurant is fairly dim.",4.0,4.0,17,2017-12-31,43.656116,-79.392384,Japanese
Omai Restaurant,"We were 2 people and ordered 4 temaki hand rolls, 2 sharable dishes, and sake. The servings were pretty small; the waiter actually recommended 3-4 hand rolls per person and 4 shared plates. The inside has an open concept, cozy, and dark vibe, good for a date. I found it over priced but ironically cheap as they give you disposable chopsticks... if I'm paying $80-100 for a dinner for 2, is it too much to ask for real chopsticks?!We tried the ganpyo, wild shrimp, king salmon, and octopus hand rolls; the pork belly and sunomono main dishes; and the server's recommended hot sake. I can't recall the sake's name, it was in a red bottle and had an especially umami taste, which the server recommended was good to drink hot. The hand rolls are made quickly and right in front of you (if you sit at the main table). You can ask the server to cut your temaki in half if you want to share! Service was great. Hand rolls tasted okay, some were a bit bland. The pork belly was crispy and just the right amount of fatty/salty. The sunomono was a unique dish of fish roe, octopus, cucumber, shrimp, and julienned zucchini.",4.0,4.0,17,2017-12-28,43.656116,-79.392384,Japanese
Omai Restaurant,"Went here for my birthday dinner with friends and it was a great night! Fits maybe 15/20 people MAX.We ordered a bunch of the hot food to share and a couple temaki each. I ordered the tuna, tamago (egg), and salmon temaki. I found them to be fresh but nothing especially remarkable. The same cannot be said for the other menu items though--they were fantastic! The pate was so yummy, perfectly paired with the seaweed crisps. The fried chicken was so well seasoned and juicy. But my favourite item was one hundred percent the potato croquettes! Soooo incredibly creamy in the inside and perfectly crunchy on the outside.Great sake selection and kind servers.

Omai Restaurant,"A hip, unique sake bar with a focus on temaki hand roll. You sit by the bar, and the servers are also the chefs! We tried all the hand rolls and the standouts are:Ganpyo - surprisingly delicious, the humble daikon is marinated with a mirin, soy sauce base, paired perfectly with creamy avocado. Tamago: if you enjoy truffle you will like this. Shrimp: refreshing and creamy.Salmon: hard to detect maple flavour but very fresh. Most of the snack menu we tried were good but nothing really stood out. Karaage has a light interesting batter. Overall it's a tad overpriced for what it is. Bill was $150 for three of us with a drink each. It's a cute place for an intimate date or friend catch up.",4.0,4.0,17,2017-11-21,43.656116,-79.392384,Japanese

Omai Restaurant,"Really great sake bar with delicious mains and well thought out atmosphere. The host did a good job of explaining the dining concept and seated everyone around a center bar around the chef. It definitely reminded me of eating in Japan.We ordered sake, yuzu saison beer from Godspeed,  five temaki (hand rolls), and two mains. The beer was so unique and really did a good job imparting the yuzu flavor. We'll probably be checking out the brewery in person.The temaki were good, albeit the ratio of fish to rice was a bit on the small side. Definitely recommend the tamago truffle roll.The croquettes were to die for. It was so rich but yet wasn't too oily or umami on the palate.Beef cheeks were soft and tender, well cooked and seasoned, but I'd probably try something else next time.We really enjoyed the meal and will be going back for sure.",4.0,4.0,17,2017-12-12,43.656116,-79.392384,Japanese
Omai Restaurant,"I wanted to like this place  really bad cuz the place looks hip and fun to hang out at night. Small space with a temaki counter if we can call it. Great concept on a temaki that could be ordered like eating omakase. Heres what i had Salmon - nothing great, menu said it has maple, i didnt get any of that flavor. Tuna - it was good, but nothing to crave for it, very traditional. Shrimp- it was good, the meyer lemon aioli match well with the shrimp Tamago- the best and must try, truffle paste. Delicious. From the kitchen we had the ff. chicken pate this was great, best thing on what we ordered Porkbelly- crispy pork with a sweet soy, nothinrg to rave about, but the pickled ramps was good. Plate looks good too. Beef cheeks- mild in flavor, persimmon carried the dish. Plate looks nice too. Sumomo(sp)- spring summer dish, super light refreshing. I could opt not to get this.

Booked a special occasion dinner for 3ppl on Nov 28/17 for Dec 15/17 @ 8pm - called & made a reservation with name & # - he even repeated my # before hanging up. Day of the dinner celebration, i call an hr before heading to the restaurant to confirm & they told me they are sorry but the restaurant is booked out for the night for a private event & they were unable to reach me because they had my # wrong. The staff i spoke to advised me that they were bought out after i made the reservation & therefore that came in higher priority than my booking. Extremely upset as it was a special occasion dinner planned & left with an hour on a Friday night to reschedule something else...What if i showed up at the restaurant with my friends to be advised that they cant serve me?....I requested to speak to the manager Edward who apologized & told me that the buy out was done prior to my reservation - conflicting information being told to me from the original staff member. I asked him to provide me the # that they apparently tried several times to reach me at to cancel - he tried to look it up but said sorry that information was deleted...just a huge disappointment & sorry definitely does not cut it.",4.0,1.0,17,2017-12-19,43.656116,-79.392384,Japanese

I enjoyed my brunch experience here quite a bit more than my dinner experience. We arrived at about 12:30 on Sunday, and it appeared the dining room downstairs was full, but we didn't have a problem getting a table upstairs. I had a mimosa for $10, but I was quite happy that it was mostly sparkling wine, with just a splash of juice. I got the full English breakfast, which comes with beans, bacon, sausage, two eggs and toast. Even though the plate looks rather small, there is quite a bit of food. I really enjoyed the sausage, which was really flavourful and not too greasy. I asked for jam for my toast and the raspberry jam was to die for. The beans weren't my favourite, a bit smokey for my liking and they were also cold. The bacon was really fatty, so I didn't finish it. Overall, I would probably come back for breakfast, but may try something else. The benedict looked delicious! The service was also excellent.

What I wouldn't give to have this in Columbus.  The menu was very extensive; a dozen different ciders on tap, another dozen or so available by the glass from bottles, and then what looked to be around 100 more of all different kinds of styles, available by the bottle.  I looked at my wife and told her I felt like I had finally found my home bar; I just had to drive around 7 hours to get there.The place is decent sized, but not huge.  According to their website they can accommodate around 80 guests, but I would have been surprised to get that many in there.  We went the day before New Year's Eve, and even though temperatures were in the single digits (farenheit), the place was still around 80% full.  We sat at the bar, so we could chat up the bartender and find out some more ideas about what we should do and sights we should see.My wife and I each got two sampler flights, each at $12 for three pours.  The menu was really solid too; I had a bowl of french onion soup, and we also got the raclette cheese platter.  It was pretty cool the way the raclette came out, with the tealight candles under it keeping the cheese gooey enough to shovel off onto the sides that came with it, some red potato wedges, broccoli, mushrooms and a few other sides.  It was fun to eat and very memorable.",4.0,5.0,83,2018-01-23,43.662326,-79.404571,"Gastropubs , Bars , Canadian (New)"
Her Father’s Cider Bar & Kitchen,"WHAT TO TRY?!?The grain bowl and the Eggs Benedict were very tasty! I especially liked the eggs Benedict because the Thuet English muffin they made tasted really good! I didn't try the duck hash but that would be the other option I would recommend since it's not a brunch option you find a lot at other restaurants!I really think this restaurant is a hidden gem. The place looks very cozy and I liked the classy look with the velvet blue sofas and the cute chairs. They specialize in ciders on tap so this makes this restobar very unique. I would come back for the dinner if I have a chance!I also really liked the grain bowl too. I liked the color combination and hence the presentation of the bowl. Like Early bird, the bowl had quinoa mixed with mushrooms sitting on top a spread of hemp. Add to that, the crunch of fresh spinach leaves and walnut bits, topped with two poached eggs! Great for those who are looking for a vegetarian option and something light to start your morning. The Thuet English muffin tastes like a tea biscuit but it's not as thick as a tea biscuit. I liked that it was crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Whether you choose the vegetarian option or the trout option, they're both good options to go with if you like eggs Benedict. The eggs are soft poach eggs with a little bit runny on the inside, just perfect! If you like apple ciders, but don't want alcohol in the morning, try their warm apple cider. Plenty of apple flavor on a cold morning, this drink will warm you up!You might wonder where her fathers cider comes from. It comes with the history of the restaurant spot the owner picked. When he ripped out the carpet, he found out that the restaurant spot had a history associated with the name her father. LAST TIP?!For brunch, they take reservations!! That's a plus on its own.

Her Father’s Cider Bar & Kitchen,"Has taken me far too long to write this review but here goes...Had a fantastic experience at Her Fathers. It was my intro to the world of cider for me as I've only had a few varieties in the past. I was blown away by the cider flights, the food and the prices (read: reasonable). The service was impeccable. Stand outs were the raclette, the charcuterie and the main proteins. A beautiful atmosphere - left happy and satiated :D I wish this new restaurant all the luck in the world - give it a try and see what you think!",4.0,5.0,83,2018-01-08,43.662326,-79.404571,"Gastropubs , Bars , Canadian (New)"
Her Father’s Cider Bar & Kitchen,"5 stars if it had not been the rubber band I found in my soup.I read great reviews about this place and decided to check it out with 2 of my friends. We came for an early dinner around 6 so the restaurant was pretty empty. It started to fill up later into the night. Atmosphere was good for dates, friends, and we saw a bigger group here for a birthday. I appreciate that the restaurant wasn't so loud that I can't hear my friends.I started with the hot apple cider and had the smoked Gouda and potato soup and the lamb sliders. Everything was delicious other than a piece of rubber band I found in the soup. I talked to the server about it and they handled it nicely.

Her Father’s Cider Bar & Kitchen,"Really cool spot. Went with friends last weekend and were super happy with the vibe - very chill, not too loud, good music - great for catching up. Huge menu - we started trying a few ciders on tap then tried some of the bottles. Lots of options in the $8/$9 price range, goes up from there. I wished there were more description on the chalkboard of ciders on tap but just a minor complaint, servers helped us out with further info. Overall, the service was very attentive, water glass was always full and serivce was friendly. We only had drinks but food looked good too.

Her Father’s Cider Bar & Kitchen,"This place is the real deal, they have some of the best cider I have ever tried!! The food is great as well for both dinner or a snack. The only reason for the 2 stars... is the smell. And by smell I mean a dish they serve ( I believe it's melted cheese) smells like stinky feet! I came in a second time with a group of 6 and we were all so excited to try the cider after I've been hyping this place up the whole night. As soon as we walk in there's an odour... it's very hard to describe but it's not good that's for sure, smelly feet perhaps? We were forced to go to another restaurant because the smell was so strong and some of the people from my party felt nauseous! It's so disappointing cause I love the food/cider here.. but I have never encountered a restaurant that smells like that.

As you may have noticed in their name, this place is famous for its cider and they really make it worth it. All the brunch drinks and cocktails have a cider twist and they also have lots of craft ciders to choose from. We had three different ounces and they all turn out to be great.

Her Father’s Cider Bar & Kitchen,"This place is really cool in concept and I like that cider bars are becoming a thing (because I love ciders). Food was pricey, but good with tiny portions. The deserts they have are amazing (but I think they change). The raclette was underwhelming and veggies were ridiculously priced (do raclette yourselves if you can, it's tasty and a fun alternative to fondue). The fried asparagus?? were perfectly fried and the Cornish hen was a small portion, everything was good, but not great. Now the ciders, the selection is impressive, but with almost 20 ciders on the rotating tap, it would be nice to have full time descriptions, instead of just the waitress giving them orally. I want to say 80% of the coders have that very earthy taste (which reminds me of composer, but to each their own), 10% are very sweet (but still yummy -anything from the shiny cidery is gold), and the lady 10% are good. (Suffice to say that I tried almost the entire rotating tap list). Would I go back? Maybe, it's cute with a nice patio.

Lots of different styles and flavors and colors and textures. I had cider that tasted like wine, cider that tasted like fresh alcoholic apple juice, cider that tasted like beer, cider that tasted bitter and sweet and crisp...It's the Willy Wonkas cider factory here and the flights are awesome.Give this place your business.

Her Father’s Cider Bar & Kitchen,"Very rarely is there any restaurant or business that truly merits a 5 star rating...but Her Father's Cider Bar definitely deserves it! First off, the service was impeccable. It was always kind, courteous, and exceeded expectations. I'm not sure which magical place the wait-staff was hired from/trained, but ALL businesses should follow suit and go on an epic quest to find this wondrous land.I came with a large group of 15 on a Saturday night, and we were able to secure a beautiful private room at the back of the restaurant for no extra fee, or minimum spending. Surprisingly, they didn't charge an auto-gratuity (but the amazing service definitely warranted a great tip). As a large group, I recognize that it can be difficult for wait-staff to serve us...people are slowly trickling in, socializing and slow to order drinks and food. However, our waiter Jayden/Jaiden was super patient with us, and flitted in and out the room intermittently to take orders or offer drink recommendations. During dinner, food and drinks came promptly, while dishes were taken away efficiently.DRINKS:Flight of 3 ($12 - 5oz each): Only the ciders on tap can be chosen for the flights. I tried the ""Perry"" Pear cider, ""Forks Not Spoons"" and the ""Shiny Peach"". Favourites were definitely the Perry and the Peach - both light, crisp and sweet. I didn't love the FnS (tasted a little too potpourri for my liking). Dommaine Pinnacle Ice Cider ($11 - 2 oz): This one was very sweet. While it was 12% alcohol, it definitely tasted more like apple juice (dangerous!!!!!)I also took sips of the pineapple/jalapeno (the jalapeno flavour was definitely not shy), thai ginger (again, ginger flavour was quite prominent), and black cherry (tasted like a sparkling wine). FOOD:Pretzel with cider/cheddar sauce ($4): that cheese sauce was 11/10, would recommend.Ribeye with spicy butter, kale and pureed sweet potato ($31): The cook was spot on and the meat was tender and flavourful. Absolutely no complaints. (They were out of the striploin that night for some reason, but they subbed it for ribeye)The menu is seasonal and always changing...thank goodness for that because then it'll just give me more of a reason to come back.

Her Father’s Cider Bar & Kitchen,"Came here for my birthday and made reservations. We had our own room almost with just one other table of 6 with us. Nonetheless the staff were friendly and attentive. Food was pretty good, I was actually surprised because for some reason I was thinking it may not be as good as their ciders. Well...I was definitely proven otherwise which makes this place even better! I got myself a flight of ciders (of course) and they come in 3 glasses. Their selection for ciders are quite vast but they do have more of the popular ones on one main menu. If you aren't too familiar with ciders like me, you can definitely ask for ones that are similar to your taste buds :) my all time favourite right now is the shiny pinot noir as it tastes VERY similar to the rose wine, Beringer White Zinfandel.Long story short, I am definitely coming back to have more of their food and try some of their other ciders!

Her Father’s Cider Bar & Kitchen,"Her Father's earned my rare and only 5 star for both brunch and dinner.  The care and attention to details by the staff makes this my quintessential and best Toronto neighbourhood restaurant. Dinner excelled beyond brunch.  Some time ago I came here for a Sunday brunch and was wow'd by the service.  It solidly put itself in the 5 star category on that alone but the decadent french toast made us drool happily Homer style. We came here after making reservations and what happens... the top manager (and possibly co-owner) spots us after talking to the hostess and greets us warmly because he remembered us from that brunch over 4 months ago!!!  HFCB has a seasonal menu and it changes ... we had the spring menu and I'm already looking forward to the next menu.  It was so hard to focus on the dinner menu as we ready to try their cider flight.   The menu is not large but it's well curated highlighting seasonal vegetables and lots of bold flavours.Before I start writing non stop about the great flavours, I want to mention why I really liked the service here.  The kitchen can be hit hard a tiny bit if there are a lot of big groups.  This made us wait a little longer for our dessert but as any good service does... they are 100% aware of it and tell you that its happening before it becomes an issue and apologizes for it.  Kudos to smartly managing the situation.  Cider Flight of Shiny Peach, Shiny Pinot Noir, and Redstone Perry (pear) - For a super reasonable $12, you can try 3 ciders that are on tap and they have a great list.  There is something for everyone.. from dry to sweet. The manager was incredibly helpful to choose the right ones.    5/5Spring vegetables - best explained as if vegetable tempura and hush puppies had a lovechild with a healthy dose of spices thrown in.  Whoever is frying these knows what they're doing.  They came well seasoned, hot, greaseless, perfectly crispy, and still tender on the inside for the okra and asparagus.  Unlike tempura, these came spiced which had an unique sweet and savoury bold hit in each bite.  Very well done.   5/5Smokey Tomato soup - A generous, creamy, and highly flavourful bowl of soup that has that softer touch of smokiness but lets the sweet tomato flavour shine along side a subtle heat that builds with each spoonful.  The addition of the finely cubed vegetables added an interesting textural crunch to the super smooth soup.  5/5Seared Albacore Tuna - A wonderfully plated main of crispy seared tuna with a still cool middle.  I loved how they pan seared it so it got a nice crispy edge instead of typical grill marks.  This dish came with a nice helping of chickpeas, chorizo, peppers, and a big smear of romesco pepper sauce.  You can taste the subtle paprika heat, garlic, and a nice nutty note in the sauce.  Only slight comment would be of the chick peas. It would be interesting to see another side with it and slightly softer (is my preference).  4.5/5Carrot and Peas - such a simple title for my vegetarian plate!  I had many things on the plate which allowed me to mix into a great flavourful spoonful.  I love how they offer a vegetarian plate that isnt pasta or soy based.  There was peas & snow peas with morel mushrooms and pearl onions, grilled butter lettuce, lentils, a large creamy smear of carrots and a perfectly poached egg that just has its yolk oozing out when cut.  Mixing the carrot, yolk, and tomato jam/sauce created a wonderful sauce coating every vegetable.  I wouldn't mind more of a spicier kick  5/5PB & Earl Grey - this is a jarred dessert that didn't quite need to be in a jar but was still a cute presentation.  Tender PB cake are cubed up and topped with a cream that seemed to be infused with earl grey tea and added a crunchy sponge toffee.  4.5/5Lemon curd tart - Shortbread sandwiching creamy, tart, and yet sweet lemon curd with bruleed meringue.  I loved this as it has a lot of great textures (soft, creamy, and crunchy) with amazing citrus flavours.  5/5This is my favourite Toronto neighbourhood restaurant...  amazing flavours and great personal service that gives you a 5 star experience.  The manager was just awesome and even left us a thoughtful gift that was just perfect finish to a great evening here.",4.0,5.0,83,2017-07-14,43.662326,-79.404571,"Gastropubs , Bars , Canadian (New)"

Her Father’s Cider Bar & Kitchen,"Her Father's Cider Bar & Kitchen was surprisingly really really really really REALLY good. I think this place might be ""my favorite bar"" if I do even have a favorite bar? I guess the word I'm looking for is gastropub. Her Father's is super close to U of T, and although the food is slightly more expensive, I think the environment was really great and the staff was super friendly. I was surprised at how beautiful the food was and the bar itself was quite quaint and cozy. Me and a couple of guys got in at around 7ish on a Saturday night. It was kind of really packed, but my fault because I didn't make a reservation. We sat on the patio, which was fine with me. Around 9, they accommodated us inside. I guess I would make a reservation next time? I got the Her Elder's Flower cocktail and the Blueberry Salad. And both of these food items were BEAUTIFUL. The blueberry salad was gorgeous and it tasted delicious too! I never expected a Blueberry Salad to look SO exciting after the failed salad I got at Harvest Kitchen three days ago (which just so happens to be right across Her Father's) but the plating was great, the dish tasted very blueberry indeed, and the balance of the ricotta was spot on. I would for sure come back here to try out some of their entrees next time! I would definitely recommend this place for a date night or a get together with friends. TLDR; Cozy and beautiful place with delicious food. BUT, the portions are quite small and the food is a tad expensive.",4.0,5.0,83,2017-04-22,43.662326,-79.404571,"Gastropubs , Bars , Canadian (New)"
Her Father’s Cider Bar & Kitchen,"Adorable and gets the job done - my review of a brunch at Her Father's Cider Bar & Kitchen. Tucked in on Harbord is this cute resto and bar. Went in on a Saturday morning around noon, and getting a table for seven people was no problemo. As the afternoon went on, the place filled in nicely. I started off with a flight of three ciders. One was a classic cider from Twin Pines, one had Thai ginger infused and the other was made with Pinot Noir grapes, giving it a deep red colour. I wasn't expecting to drink at brunch, but once you see the presentation and amazing selection, it is hard to say no! For my meal, I had the duck hash with spinach, sunny side up egg, pumpkin seeds and a bechemel sauce. The duck was a little too crispy for my liking, but otherwise a very satisfying first meal of the day. I couldn't finish all the breakfast potatoes that came along with it, and the egg was perfectly fried. Around the table, we had ordered a couple mounds of extra breakfast potatoes that proves to not really be necessary given the portion sizes, but they were still appreciated by the table.

Cinco Mexican Restaurant,"The kind of food you'd be happy to get fat eating.Just checked this recently-opened place with my brother this afternoon. I had the chicken and pork street tacos and they were both excellent; easily two of the best tacos I've ever had.The tortillas tasted and had the texture of being made in-house, the flavours of the meat, cilantro, and onions, complemented each other well, and the various flavours of help-yourself salsas brought it all together.My brother and I split the churros for dessert. They were filled with caramel and topped with tart raspberry compote. Predictably delicious.The whole bill for the both of us was under $25, so some great value too.Seriously consider checking these killer tacos out if you like spicy and authentic Mexican food.",4.0,5.0,16,2017-12-13,43.643092,-79.447663,Mexican
Cinco Mexican Restaurant,"Popped into this place around noon and it was absolutely packed. Had a quick look at the menu and thought it was quite nice. We were doing a little food tour on Roncy so didn't want to consume a full meal before we had a chance to sample all of the beautiful offering that the local shops had on offer. We walked the stretched and managed find find a few small things to munch on. After the walk back, I suggested we get some tacos at Cinco. Was provided some awesome tortilla chips at no cost. They had a wide selection of salas at no additional cost as well which was very nice. Before I forget, the waitress was exceptional. She had notice that we had popped in earlier and was surprised to see us back a couple hours later. The food was spectacular. I ordered the mixed pork 'gourmet' taco - consisting of pork belly, loin and some other delicious ingredients ~$8 and change. My SO ordered the three for $10 and got the fish (2) and beef (1). Quite honestly, the food here is delicious and worth the wait. Yes we were there off peak hours and so not everything would have been prepared quickly - so there was a bit of a wait - but it was really delicious (almost as good as Seven Lives in Kensington Market.

Cinco Mexican Restaurant,"I've been here 4 times now, and I really want to love this place. But unfortunately, my experiences have been underwhelming overall. We always order the vegetarian tacos with no cheese, a side of fries and refried beans. Although we have asked that they add a little guac to the tacos in place of the cheese, they always just send an order of guac ($4 for a tiny ramekin, eek!) and then charge us for it, not mentioning it. At first I chalked it up to a language barrier. The second time I specifically said, ""please add the guac instead of the cheese, but not a full order."" Again, we received a full order, and a $4 charge on the bill, which I disputed and the manager/owner reluctantly removed, saying he'd do it ""this time."" You would think that restaurants would be accommodating, to keep customers coming back, but I guess not. So the third and fourth times I went, I didn't even bother asking about the miniscule amount of guac, but instead just bit the bullet and ordered a side of guac, along with the refried beans. Last time we went, despite saying ""no cheese"" on any of the food, the refried beans arrived with cheese all over the top, so we had to send it back. They were happy to swap it out but come on. Pay attention.They offer free chips and salsa while you wait for your food, so last time I asked for a few more (as we had salsa leftover). The waitress brought five more chips and later charged us $1.50 for them. Didn't mention it, just added the charge to the bill. When I asked about it at the end, she basically shrugged and said that's the way it is. Despite the mixup with the cheese on the refried beans, the fact we didn't have any cheese on our tacos, etc., they still had to gouge us on the five tortilla chips. Nice.On top of this, the tacos are nowhere near as delicious as they were in the beginning. They have changed the tortillas to blue corn, which have a stronger taste, and the veg filling in the tacos is more bland now. Maybe it's tastier with cheese? I will never know.Overall, this place is mediocre at best, and the service is hit and miss. On top of that, the place leaves your clothes smelling like the food, for days. I had to wash my winter coat because it smelled like taco meat.Despite this place being in my neighbourhood, I don't think I'll be going back here unless I just want some fries as a quick snack.",4.0,2.0,16,2018-01-07,43.643092,-79.447663,Mexican
Cinco Mexican Restaurant,"I've been anticipating this restaurant to open since I saw the coming soon signs. Recently opened, I dined in to check it out.Food: They have a selection of rotisserie chicken (pollo rostizado), gourmet tacos and street tacos. They also have imported Mexican soda (grapefruit, pineapple and other flavours). If you sit in, they give you complimentary nachos and salsa verde! I tried the 1/4 chicken which came with broiled potatoes and three tortillas. The chicken was the star of the plate, it is juicy inside and held a pack of sweet and savoury flavour. I left the pescado (fish) street taco for last, it came with two pieces of battered fish, onion, cilantro and one tortilla. I guess I left it out too long, as the fish was not buttery and moist inside. Service & atmosphere: The staff are friendly and as I was a first timer they explained the items on their menu. If you want to know more about the food, they'd be glad to share their origins. The murals along the walls are painted with beautiful detail, I could not take my eyes off them.Price: The 1/4 chicken plate and fish taco was $13.27 altogether. Leaving with a full stomach on that price seems fair to me. The next time I come back, will try the gourmet tacos.

The service was very friendly, and tour server was happy to answer any questions we had about the menu.We were informed that they were unfortunately out of the gourmet seafood (marisco) taco, so I ordered the gourmet vegetarian tacos, while my partner ordered a sampling of the smaller street tacos. All of the ingredients were high quality, and everything seemed fairly fresh. We also appreciated the salsa bar and enjoyed sampling several varieties. We ultimately weren't blown away by the tacos. They were all tasty, but a little bit more subdued than many of the other tacos you might find in the city, with fairly standard toppings. Our sides of chips and guacamole and fried potatoes were both quite good. Prices were reasonable and the portions are substantial. A nice restaurant, but I have to admit that a liquor license would improve the experience substantially.

Cinco Mexican Restaurant,"Was in the mood for tacos, so I thought I would try this newly opened place in Roncesvalles. Terribly disappointed. The whole place was smoky and smelt like a greasy deep fryer - to the point my clothes and my hair are going to smell all day now... the tacos were underwhelming, didn't even come warm. Payment took forever. Was standing in line trying to pay for almost 15 minutes. The owner couldn't figure out how to split the cheque between my friend and I, so he just said ""I don't know how"" and asked if I could pay it all - very awkward and unprofessional.

The cheese and meat board came with 4 slices of bread, a few slim pieces of toast, and some jam, Dijon, and butter. Everything was good. Special shout out to the pork ribs over mac and cheese, they were PHENOMENAL! The melted cheese inside the arancini were a pleasant surprise. I also loved the Rondin du Poitou goat cheese and Chorizo Iberico. Service was slow, our server apologized a few times about it. But the ribs over mac and cheese were so good that I don't even care.

Nuit Social,"Nuit Social is the type of spot Toronto needs more of. The space is intimate, the food is great and the drinks are on point. The charcuterie board, as many have mentioned, is well done at NS, with both the presentation and quality of the offerings exceeding expectations. That you can choose from a variety of delicious olives is also a very nice touch and something that more TO restaurants should offer. The mains, which are also somewhat tapas style, did not disappoint us either. From the dishes we tried the octopus was the best bet, while I would skip over the steak during my next visit. One particular complaint was the noise level which was a bit out of control during our visit. The restaurant can get very loud, and in our case, a rowdy group sitting a few tables away managed to kill the vibe. Aside from that, and wishing for a more comprehensive wine list, there is little that could be better at Nuit Social.

Nuit Social,"This is a tiny little place, maybe seating for just over 30 people. There is no material for absorbing noise, so when it is relatively full the ambient noise is extremely loud. You have to lean across the table to hear what somebody opposite you is saying.It has an unusual menu structure, of Tapa like dishes divided into meat, cheese, and olives for one, three or five portions:  And then more substantial ""plates"". On this occasion we stayed with ""plates"".The octopus came in a small bowl and it was soft with a very Spanish taste with lots of garlic, warm small potatoes and a pleasant slightly spicy sauce. The calamari were thinly sliced with a spicy outside and correctly cooked. The gnocchi came in a creamy sauce, were tender and again lots of garlic. The shrimp were very well presented and had a deep taste were on a bed of potato, peas, lardon and was laced with spice. The Cornish hen had crispy skin again spicy, was rich, worthwhile, hot and tasty.The lemon curd desert, came in a tiny tumbler, was rich, sharp and cool.On this occasion the three servers, which is quite enough for such a small room, seemed more interested in talking amongst themselves than actually attending to their guests. When we arrived, there was only one other table, even so one had to get up to actually attract the attention of one of the three.

To round out our meal, we shared 2 tapas - octopus ($14) and gnocchi ($15).  It was the perfect amount of food to share and we felt we got a nice variety.Had a lovely time just hanging in the back patio with our casual dinner and it was actually quite romantic back there so I think a great date place!",4.0,4.0,159,2017-10-12,43.642901,-79.425364,"Cocktail Bars , Modern European , Canadian (New)"

The menu is very small and the dishes are meant to be shared. The special for the night was buck a shuck and we ordered half a dozen. The oysters were fresh and bigger than normal. We also ordered the calamari and flat iron steak with chimichurri. The steak wasn't as flat as I thought it would be and was cooked medium rare, which was good. The brussel sprouts and potatoes were grilled enough and crispy. The only bad thing about the dish was that it was a bit salty. The calamari was delicious and it was a big serving.

Nuit Social,"Nuit Social is an absolute gem for all those social nights. The small restaurant looks ordinary on the exterior and can be easily missed walking by. However when you walk inside, the modern style mixed with a touch wooden cabin design welcomes you at first sight. The ambience was cozy and quiet enough to carry on a conversation without yelling across the table. This place is usually fully booked, but my boyfriend and I was lucky to catch a open time slot. We were greeted very friendly to our table and our drinks were quickly served while giving us time to analyze the menu. We decided to start off with a double meat charcuterie board and for our mains, we chose the balsamic glazed  pork ribs mac and cheese.Double cheese charcuterie: The board had Prociutto and Bresaola paired with Vermeer cheese.   The vermeer cheese paired particular well with the bresaola cured meat. I like how it came with olives and two different of jam, butter, and bread. Balsamic glazed pork ribs mac and cheese: This was the best mac and cheese. It is two type of comfort food coming together in one bowl!!! The balsamic glazed soy pork ribs tasted similar to  teriyaki sauce but much sweeter due to the honey glazed. The pork ribs were very tender and it literally fell off the bones. The mac was covered in melted cheese and was not too heavy in taste, which when mixed with the balsamic soy glazed sauce, it had a sweet & salty taste. Definitely a double action comfort food that goes well with your favourite beer and a excellent choice for those friday night social nights. The waiters were very attentive and has depth knowledge of the menu.

They all came beautifully presented, with some homemade compotes and spreads, some crostinis and we got homemade focaccia (which was fluffy and light). EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING!

Baretto Caffe,"2018.01.29Here is an update to my last review. Since going to Baretto for the first time, it has become one of my favourite Coffee / Breakfast and Italian lunch places. I have over the last two years become closely acquainted with Manuelle and his wife, Cristina, the owners. They are such lovely people and they put out the freshest and most delicious Italian food in the city. Its simple, fresh, homely and FREAKING DELICIOUS!!!The coffee .....ohhhh the coffee......

It is located in the rear or this rather inconspicuous medical building. Let me start by saying that Yelp does not have the number of stars that I would like to give this place. The barista is a true gentleman named Manuelle who really makes you feel welcome. The place looks wonderful and there is another room as well that is a little more intimate and private. I had a coffee and a croissant and it's was delicious x  . The place is clean, open and really relaxing.

We watched them prepare, and serve - being in the other big room; it did not seem to be the most efficient way to run a cafe.If based on coffee alone, it's a very solid 4 stars.Food, however missed its 5 stars rating with us.Lasagna $9.50 - aside from the sauce being more watery than sauce, it was delicious. The garlic bread that it came with was burnt though.Italian Pannini $6.35 - it was good.Fantasia Salad $9.90 - what can you expect from a salad, right?We also ordered a cappuccino (delicious!) and an italian hot chocolate (super crazy way too sweet). Prices are reasonable for what you get, and I see why people love this little cafe. For what this little cafe offers, it's enough. Not opening on weekends, well, that's a lot of missed out business. Servers are nice. Parking is easy. A little hard to find as it's tucked away.Overall, it's between a 3.5 to 4 stars for us. If we were ever in the area again on a weekday, we would come back.

The rosé sauce was creamy and slightly sweet and paired well with the crisp prosciutto. The rigatoni was perfectly al dente. The garlic bread was light and fresh and perfectly seasoned.I've also tried the Prosciutto Pizza ($10.99) which is topped with a generous amount of prosciutto, fresh arugula and parmigiano. The crust is light and crispy but a little thicker than I personally like.You can also get a complimentary cappuccino for checking-in on yelp.The cafe is hidden inside a medical building and is not the easiest to find but totally worth the effort to come here.",5.0,5.0,197,2017-12-09,43.744768,-79.346527,"Cafes , Italian"

Since the pasta is made to order you can call in your order a head of time. Baretto is top rated in Toronto on Yelp and I can see why. It's quality over quantity.

Have to thank @grasshoppereats for this great recommendation on her social media, as I would have never know about this cafe otherwise as it is hidden in a office/commercial-like building.

Baretto Caffe,"I have been meaning to try this for place for awhile now since a lot of people who work near there said it is a good place for lunch. There's also a free cappuccino offer if you check-in on Yelp. Even though I was told that the restaurant is hidden inside a medical building, I expected a large sign on the street for people to see. Unfortunately, the sign only faced one side (South of Don Mills Rd) and so I passed by the location twice. I was greeted by the owner as I walked into the restaurant. There was a small open space with wooden chairs/tables on one side and a slightly bigger room with white chairs and tables for more group seatings, with several outlets, magazines, and calming music on the other side. I ordered a 12"" vegetarian pizza ($9.40) and a ginseng cappuccino (originally $3.99, but got it for free due to Yelp check-in). The pizza was made to order. It was delicious and there was enough toppings on the pizza. However, it wasn't anything special so I don't think I will order it next time. The ginseng cappuccino was made very hot just as I had requested it. It didn't have enough ginseng taste though, it tasted rather caramel-y, but overall, it was a great drink and I would definitely order it again. The table next to us ordered a tuna fantasia salad and a lasagna, and both looked really good.

All of that for only $12 is pretty good value for the food.

The Hole In the Wall,"Was quite disappointed given high rating for this place.  This place runs in a long narrow hall, with unique/cozy decor, buck-a-shuck oysters on Tuesday's and a good selection of beer on taps....and that's about all in terms of pros.  For cons - to start, the service was EXTREMELY underwhelming.  They seemed to be snobby wannabe hipsters that are out there to judge you.  We are a group of 3, but only the two of us came first so we sat by the bar with 1 seat to our left.  First thing the server said was ""Hi, but I might need to move you later"", without even checking first whether that other seat was ours.  Then our server was impossible to find to order food, order drinks, follow-up on our orders and to get our bill.  And when we got our bill, he mistakenly charged us for a drink we didn't have, and gave us some half ass apology for the extra charge.  Food was very mehh also - we ordered the duck wings and they were tough as rubber, and the sauce tasted burnt.  Also got the trout served two ways and it was ok - but nothing memorable.  Lastly - we got this cooked apple in some IPA beer foam for dessert, recommended by the server, and it was soOOOO gross.  It was sour, mushy, and in some stale beer foam that none of us wanted to eat after the first bite.  Everything was quite pricey given the small portions - the bill came to $125 for 3 people.  The oysters was their only redemption, but honestly, it's raw and all you gotta do is shuck em.  So Koodos to their supplier for fresh oysters.  It was also cramped af - but I guess that's why it's called a hole in the wall.Don't think I'll be coming back - If I wanna go to a hole in the wall, I can definitely find a lot of dingy cramped corners that serve better food at cheaper prices with friendlier and more attentive staff elsewhere!",4.0,2.0,133,2017-12-26,43.665337,-79.465149,"Pubs , Canadian (New)"

The Hole In the Wall,"I like weird, unusual, creepy old buildings (sometimes ppl too). There is something mysterious in this place.

At least the bar's chairs were wide and cozy. I couldn't stop looking around to all those bizarre decorations. The Hole in the Wall is narrow (not in the mind), gothic tall, anaconda long, and an excellent stop to have a nice meal, party, or conversation.The multitasking guy who seemed to run the joint welcomed us; asked how many we were, attended the bar, complimented my choice of Alvarinho, brought the tapas, and charged the bill (he was not only active but also attentive and inviting).The bread with the duck fat reminded me those the grandpa would cook for Heidi. Although it sounds gross I liked it better than butter, and the quality of the bread was good too.The calamari was excellent: 100% recommendable.The potatoes were lacking seasoning.

The pot de creme was alright, the flavour was the same but it had a grainy texture, like the sugar didn't quite fully dissolve. My friends got the cheesecake, which came with some burnt dulce de leche resembling clump on top, and the cheese and artichoke dip, which was more like cheese and grease dip. What made it worse was the service. Oh my god, the service. There was one waiter and one buser, and we sat at the entrance. The waiter was too busy chatting with people around the bar that it was impossible to get any service. We had to wave him down for our bill via charades, then waited for the machine.

Go Topoki,"Modern and casual place serving yummy topoki!We had a craving for Korean food and wanted to try something a bit different from the usual BBQ and noodles. Topoki is a traditional Korean dish of thick rice noodles served in sauce and toppings. We popped in on Sunday morning and ended up being their first customers at noon.Inside, the restaurant has two floors and it sports a bright and airy feel with modern decor. The servers were very nice and gave us some feedback on the different sauces. We ordered the veggie fritters and the rose sauce - one with seafood and one with bacon.The food didn't take too long to come out and we were pleasantly surprised by the big bowls of rose sauce with lots of rice noodles swimming in it. My bacon one also had a hotdog on top of it. As I scooped up some noodles, bacon and onions, it tasted great - nice creamy taste combined with a kick of heat at the end. Bacon and onion were nice touches to it. But, I think the winner here is the seafood one - lots of mussels, shrimp and squid! The sauce went quite well with seafood - definitely worth the extra 3 dollars! The only medicore item was the veggie fritters - we we're hoping for more veggie tempura - we got a generous portion but it could have used a bit more salt. I ended up dipping them in to the rose sauce - that kinda tells you how much I liked the sauce.

Go Topoki,"This place is awesome!Located on yonge street just outside of the Northtown plaza, this is a cute new restaurant with some cool takes on Korean snack foods.We were warmly greeted at the door and seated. The place is really bright and cute but the booths aren't too comfortable, I probably wouldn't want to spend more than an hour or so sitting around. They can maybe invest in some cushions for the chairs, but no big deal! We ordered the rosé topoki  with bacon and it was definitely the highlight of the meal. The rice cakes were chewy and satisfying and the sauce was really good, I wasn't sure whether to expect an Italian inspired sauce or something more Korean and surprisingly, it was both. This sauce is a mix of their original sauce and some cream so it was a bit tangy but also creamy. I really liked this and thought it was clever to incorporate these flavours together. We also ordered the popcorn chicken and the fried platter. Both were good but not as memorable. I'd maybe stick to the topoki or try one of the rice or noodle bowls. Looking around, the seafood options looked amazing so I'd opt for one of those next time.The portion sizes were good for the price, $10-13 for the topoki, depending on the toppings and these things are filling. We shared one and had two appetizers and had a good amount of food. For dessert they also have a few options of bingsoo, we tried the chocolate which was amazing, this was my first time trying this dessert and I loved it, I can imagine myself eating these all the time in the summertime, they're refreshing rather than rich or heavy which was great! The service was really genuine and nice. Our food arrived quickly and water was refilled regularly without having to ask for it. No complaints for service, I just feel bad that their kitchen is upstairs and they have to run up and down to get food, etc... but they seem to be in good spirits.Overall, I'd definitely come back here to get my topoki fix.

Go Topoki,"Go Topoki is a restaurant featuring Korean rice cakes (tteokbokki).  It's located on Yonge Street 15 minutes south of Finch Station.  It's a relatively new restaurant (opened just in November 2017) and is very modern inside with bright yellow walls and chairs and a gorilla as a mascot.The menu at Go Topoki is predominantly all about the Korean stir-fried rice cakes and it comes in four different sauces (Red, White, Brown, and Rosé) with various ingredients tossed into it.Korean stir-fried rice cakes can be a hit or miss.  We ordered the Rosé Topokki which was their signature red sauce with cream.  We chose the bacon option which consisted of bacon, broccoli, onion, and red peppers.I liked that their utensils had cute faces on them!The order came out quickly by one of the two servers that was working there in the restaurant that night.  I felt bad for the two servers who had to constantly climb and walk down the single flight of stairs all night long to get the food.  Apparently their kitchen was on the second floor so every time they had to deliver the cooked food, they had to walk up and down the stairs to get the food to us.The topokki thankfully was quite good.  It was the right consistency of chewiness and tenderness.  The rice cakes' texture wasn't hard at all which can always be a deterrent when it comes to rice cakes.  There was an abundance of the rosé sauce so that all of the rice cakes were drenched in it.  This was a good thing though because when rice cakes are dry, they taste terrible.The rosé sauce sauce was thick and quite spicy (and quite salty by itself).  While there were a lot of bacon in the dish, there were fewer onions, and even fewer broccoli and red peppers in the dish.  I would say that the broccoli and red peppers were practically non-existent.The dish was topped with a meticulously scored plain hot dog sausage.It'll be interesting to see how Go Topoki fares in the upcoming months and years.  Their menu also includes snacks like popcorn chicken and fish cake skewers, rice and noodle options, and dessert like bingsu too.  It seemed like a good place to order a variety of topokki dishes and snacks to share over chitchatting.The servers were prompt with serving us since it wasn't very busy there on a Saturday night.  Their washrooms were very clean and interesting with flashing lights installed around the mirror.",4.0,3.0,41,2018-01-22,43.774884,-79.414001,Korean
Go Topoki,"I have never had Topoki before, but Go Topoki has me keen for more!My girlfriend and I came here on a whim since the bakery we had originally planned to visit was closed. The two floor restaurant has a clean and modern decor. Their white and yellow theme is cute! Since we've never had Topoki before, we asked the server what the portion sizes were like. He said that Topoki dishes were for one person, but we shared one dish because we already had something to eat. I think that their Topoki is a good size for one person if you're running on empty.Their lunch special was $10 with an included drink. We ordered their bacon and sausage Topoki with the rosé sauce base and a hot apple cidar. The sauce was slightly spicy, which made the flavour profile much more interesting. Topoki is similar to Shanghai style Nian Gao--since I've never had it before, I cannot comment on its authenticity. I will say that the sauce was creamy and not overly oily. That being said, it was absolutely delicious! The food came quickly and the server was delightful. We paid at the front when we were ready and were never pressured to leave. Go Topoki has a café-like ambiance with serious kitchen chops--don't miss it if you're in the area!

Go Topoki,"Came here with some friends for dinner. I enjoy tteokbokki but don't often get to eat it because when my friends order it, it is often served in spicy preparations. So when I saw a place that sells non-spicy rice cakes, I knew my friends and I had to come here.Options for rice cake dishes include Red (gochujang or spicy) sauce, Brown (soy and bulgogi sauce) and White (cream based) sauce. I appreciated having options that are not spicy. The rice cakes were satisfyingly chewy. I enjoyed the soy/bulgogi rice cakes which had a pleasant sweetness to the dish and a decent amount of thinly sliced beef. The cream based dish had bacon and a hot dog on top. I would have appreciated a bit more sauce.The red sauce was not as spicy as other places I've tried, and unlike other places, it lacked substance (as in additional toppings like fish cakes or kimchi) and sauciness that I've come to associate with other tteokbokki preparations. Other snacks include popcorn chicken ($6), gimmari (envision fried sushi hand rolls with glass noodles instead of rice)($5), mandu (dumplings)($5), soondae (blood sausage) ($7), and fish cake skewers or fish cake soup. We ordered a fries platter that included mandu, gimmari, and veggie fries. The mandu wrapper was a bit hard for my liking. The veggie fries were more like a veggie fritter and were great for dipping into the different rice cakes sauces. The gimmari was a pleasant surprise as the flavour of crispy seaweed and texture of chewy glass noodles was an unexpectedly tasty combination.For dessert, they have chocolate, green tea and injeolmi flavoured bingsoo ($8 each). We got the green tea, chocolate and injeolmi bingsu. They were very generous with the roasted soybean powder for the injeolmi bingsu and cocoa powder for the chocolate bingsu but less so when it came to the matcha powder for the green tea bingsu. The bingsu was yummy nonetheless but I would have to say I prefer the overall flavour profile of bingsu I had at the Cups.Sapporo beer is on tap. There is a second floor but seating is mostly on the main floor. Seating is limited for larger groups, especially during peak hours. Did I mention they have super cute utensils with emotive faces on them? If you enjoy rice cakes, you should try Go Topoki.",4.0,3.0,41,2017-12-04,43.774884,-79.414001,Korean
Go Topoki,"Wow - who would've thought rice cakes and fish cakes could look so aesthetically pleasing. This modern, minimalistic Korean street food joint is where it's at when you're looking to take some photos.

For food we got spicy rice cake with 'red' sauce aka gochujang (they also offer bulgogi, cream, and rosé sauce - how fancy!!!) You can also add extras for $2 each - cheese, ramen, etc. We also got soondae (blood sausage), fish cakes that come with a yummy broth that's a staple combination with the spicy rice cake, and the fries platter which consists of Korean style veggie fries, gimmari (fried glass noodles wrapped with seaweed), and mandu (dumplings). Although we ordered the spicy rice cake, it wasn't as spicy as we thought it would be. Rather, it was a little bland and the consistency was a bit too watery. Each rice cake dish is the perfect portion to eat for one person, or to share if you're ordering other things as well. I'm hoping to try the different sauces for the rice cakes - especially when I'm feeling bougie with that rosé.",4.0,4.0,41,2017-11-27,43.774884,-79.414001,Korean
Go Topoki,"This is a cute snack place with a variety of rice cake dishes and korean snacks. I would recommend ordering a few dishes and sharing amongst your group.We ordered the cream based topoki (with bacon) $10, fish cakes in a broth (2 for $5)  popcorn chicken ($6). The creamy topoki is delicious and very different than the traditional topoki in gojujang sauce. The fish cakes were good - perfect for a cold day and the popcorn chicken was decent. The service is very attentive and they are super polite. They also offer desserts as well. I will def. come back and try the rest of the menu items.",4.0,4.0,41,2017-12-13,43.774884,-79.414001,Korean
Go Topoki,"New Korean restaurant in north York neighbourhood. They offers topokki (rice cake) in three kinds sauces, red (spicy), white (creamy), and brown (Korean BBQ sauce). They also have few appetizers, and bingsoo (shaved ice).We order brown topokki in brown sauce with bulgolgi, with added cheese (for additional $2). The taste is not too spectacular but decent, like other Korean restaurants nearby. But I like the innovation of the restaurant, a good combination of traditional Korean food, snacks, and bingsoo. It has something for everyone. The decoration is very modern and bright, lots of seats. Service is very attentive, and they give you a feedback form to fill out after meal.I would recommend this place to others.",4.0,4.0,41,2017-11-08,43.774884,-79.414001,Korean

Clean restroom? Double check. Lighting that dims at night? Check. Cute engraved cuttery? Check. Affordable?

They also served it with forks and knives instead of chopsticks which adds a bit for sophistication. :)All in all, I would recommend!",4.0,5.0,41,2018-01-20,43.774884,-79.414001,Korean

Go Topoki,"For the name of the restaurant to have their main dish in the name, I expect them to excel in topoki. Needless to say, staff were friendly and polite, place is clean and comfortable but minimal seating. Prices are decent as well.There are three main sauces with the Topoki: brown (soy sauce base), white (cream) or regular (spicy gojuchang). Overall I enjoyed the regular one and the regular spicy was already spicy for me, but I don't normally stand spicy that well. That being said, the topoki was soft and chewy and well cooked, and the accompaniments (fish cakes etc) were well seasoned and cooked. The soy base one was a tad bit sweeter than I would like but it did balance out the spiciness from the other. The topoki in this one was a bit under, hence the 3 star rating.I also ordered their fried app, with seaweed roll, fried yams, and dumplings. All were flavourful but nothing out of the ordinary.Overall satisfying the taste bud if you crave topoki. They also serve shaved ice (bingsu) but we didn't try it.",4.0,3.0,41,2017-11-29,43.774884,-79.414001,Korean

Go Topoki,"This is a nice brightly lit restaurant. My friends and I have been eyeing this place for awhile. We ordered a brown bulgogi, red seafood regular spicy, fries platter, 5 fish skewers and the white combo (white bacon, green grape soju, and popcorn chicken). The bulgogi was my favorite, it was sweet and salty. Although my friends said they found it a little salty when they ate too much. The white bacon was creamy and the bacon complimented the sauce well, wasn't too salty. Can't say much about the red seafood because I didn't try it. The popcorn chicken came with 2 sauces, wasabi mayo and Thai chili. In the fries platter, I loved the friend veggies, the dumplings were forgettable, and didn't try the seaweed roll. The fish cake skewers were pretty big for the price. Soup complimented the rice cakes well.Overall, great staff, pretty delicious food, would come back when I'm craving rice cakes.",4.0,4.0,41,2018-01-12,43.774884,-79.414001,Korean
Go Topoki,"Came here for soft opening special.   ordered the bulgogi dish and original rice cakes (red sauce with fishcake).   Although we ordered mild original flavor (gochujang)..  it was sooooo damn spicy.  i can handle spice but that was definitely not mild sauce.  It was comparable with suicide wings.  also, picture had green onions but mine didnt have any.  Just came out red.  anyways, in terms of the food.  It may not look like a lot but it can fill you.  Pure Carb Gluttony!The setting is modern but definitely did not feel like a warm and welcoming restaurant to me.  Felt very art gallerish  if that makes sense.  Food is prepared upstairs and brought down the stairs which seemed like potential hazard in the future (Murphys Law).the dishes did not come with enough meat.  Which i found myself having guilt for eating so much chewy rice cakes. (Texture was very nice though)I do give them points for packaging up the food very nicely in sealed microwave dinner looking packs.  Packaging and everything is nice.  But IMO, it needs work.   probably wont return.   But one of the staff did ask for my feed back at the end of my meal which was very nice of him to do.  He was very polite and seemed to want the restaurant to succeed.  Hope they do.  Good luck.",4.0,3.0,41,2017-11-13,43.774884,-79.414001,Korean
Go Topoki,"As an avid fan of Korean food, I was thrilled to see what this Korean street food joint had to offer. Go Topoki is located in the heart of Yonge and Finch, a very accessible place that is surrounded by variety of other restaurants you can head too if you are feeling something else.The menu has a good amount of dishes that are rice/fish cake based. The serving for each dish is also a lot so you can get multiple things and share them amongst your friends. We ordered the seafood topoki, the regular red topoki and fish cakes in broth, all of them were super yummy and the topoki was deliciously chewy. The service was very attentive and polite, and the restaurant itself is very clean and neatly set up.

Go Topoki,"Disclosure: never has topoki before. Didn't even know it was a thing Came here on a whim, because the bakery that I wanted to go to was closed. The restaurant has two floors and the decor is really cute. They have little characters in the utensils! The staff was really nice and didn't rush us at all when we were settling in and warming ourselves up. My SO and I shared one plate of Topoki, since we weren't very hungry (we went to One Ten café and Mr. Chu before this. See other reviews). Their topoki comes with a free drink during lunch. We got the mildly spicy rosé sauce with bacon and hot apple cider. The cider was delicious. Very good choice! The topoki came quickly and the waiter also brought two plates so that we could share. I've never had it before, so I don't know if it tastes authentic, but wow. I thought it was incredible! The sauce was to die for! So creamy, but not oily and so flavourful. The little cylinders has a kind of sticky texture. Very good! The plate was more than enough for two. All the other customers that came in while we were eating were all Korean people, so maybe it's a sign that it tastes authentic? We sat there for the longest time after we finished eating. Our plates were already taken away and we were just chatting, but we were never pressured to leave. They didn't even bring the bill! They just let us enjoy the place and talk.

All of the food was good and the rice cakes are heavy and filling. Ordering the fries platter is a good combo with topoki sauce you use to dip it in.

Best make your order mild spicy!Go Topoki is a unique cafe/restaurant hybrid that offers lattes and bingsu desserts as well as the signature topoki dishes and alcohol (beer and soju). I'd highly recommend ordering the rose topoki with fresh mussels. It's a delicious balance of spicy and creamy sauce with the soft chewiness of the topoki. However, if you're ordering the red topoki, then have it mild! It was already super spicy for me.

Nothing special.3 stars for the fried platter.  The mandu was nice - not too garlicky.  The other 2 items were so-so.3.5 stars overall.  A bit pricey for Korean street food but the atmosphere made up for it.  Service was kind of slow.  Will probably come back for the white topoki.,4.0,4.0,41,2017-12-13,43.774884,-79.414001,Korean
Manpuku Japanese Eatery,"I have been here several times and like and appreciate it. With that said, based on my latest visit, this is a generous four-star rating.First and foremost the food. I very much appreciate the items on the menu (rice, udon noodles, more recently ramen noodles and other staples of Japanese cuisine), which are not made fusion or Canadianized. No gimmicks here. What is more they offer varieties related to the owner's Kyoto hometown.The taste however leaves something to be desired. The food needs much more flavour. Japanese food needs marination and dashi and Manpuku needs to step up.The portions are small, but I have to say that I was completely full for $11 because I ordered two dishes. yes, the prices... knowing they are in a food court and next to a college the prices are economical.I had the shigure rice bowl and missed the shoga (ginger) taste, It lacked favour, which is why they offer you Japanese seven spices automatically. The rice was fine. The bowl was $7, which is fair. They also offer alcohol and Japanese cheesecake, etc.Think about it. Their ramen bowl is $8 (which is how much a ramen bowl is in Japan) and they are only one small non-corporate location. In contrast some of the other ramen chains in town charge double that (and I have to say while they offer a little more quantity the quality of some ramen in town leaves a lot to be desired so it is not like we are comparing very bad ramen to very good ramen either). Kinton needs to improve its broth, get better chashu. Sensotei's tonkotsu is not even tonkotsu. Touhenboku is rather bad. I don't even bother with places like Ajisen..ServiceThis place is packed and they are rushed. With that said, they are all Japanese so they never comes across as impolite or dismissive. Unlike Kinka, Sake bar Kushi, Uncle Tetsu, etc. the black t-shirt clad staff are entirely Japanese here. The good looking owner has done the same thing for over ten years and is still attentive and caring. They could probably use an additional waitress, but fact is where would they stick the person?? lolUpon entrance you are given a menu and asked whether you would like tea or water. Everything else moves at varying speed i.e. depending on how busy they are could be fast or slow.The waitress/cashier are still polite.They are in a food court, but occupy the favoured walled-off and dine-in space with waitstaff. Amazingly, for $11 or so one could have a meal and a side, which is what eating at the crappy junk food (McDonalds, Popeyes...) stands next door would cost you!During lunch here I had the pleasure of sitting next to what sounded like a student and her teacher and could overhear the entire conversation with what sounded like a pretty straightforward attempt by her to pick him up. I am all for younger women/much older men relationships (and anything else that anyone's heart desires), but kept wondering if there are rules for student/teacher relationships. Whether he ended up saying yes to her or not I cannot be sure, but he did pick up the bill for both of them lol.I recommend you order udon if you go to Manpuku.",4.0,4.0,350,2018-01-10,43.653653,-79.390943,"Japanese , Noodles"
Manpuku Japanese Eatery,"3.5 stars because there's no half star option. not a lot of seafood toppings for dishes containing them and onigiri was bland. otherwise, very affordable authentic japanese cuisine! definitely a hidden gem.my friend and i shared 4 dishes and the total cost was 21$! how affordable is that? we got:onigiri - both tofu and tuna. very bland. minimal tofu/tuna to nonechawan mushi (japanese egg pudding with seafood) - creamy and very different from tradition ""pudding"". think soup but with a layer of eggs. again, barely any seafood. sobaro don (spicy minced pork on rice) - probably the best dish! large portion, lots of meat. could use a bit more spiciness but according to my friend it was perfect. very flavourful! the scallions added a touch of freshness to the disgtakoyori - the best takoyori i had in years. it's made to order so you know it's fresh. again, very little octopus pieces. everything here goes well togethersuper fast service!",4.0,4.0,350,2017-11-23,43.653653,-79.390943,"Japanese , Noodles"

Manpuku Japanese Eatery,"I was really excited to try out this place because I love cheap, quality asian eats (especially after blowing up my wallet at night it up). But I'm not a fan.I ordered the Hotate Rice, otherwise known as the scallop and egg rice. It's basically a very thin omelette with a few pieces of scallops smothered in japanese BBQ sauce and furikake. The egg was a bit overcooked and VERY thin. There was way too much rice compared to the layer of egg that topped it. Not to mention, the dish was $10 tax included.I think the saddest part wasn't the fact that my dish tasted mediocre, but the fact that my friend ordered an udon that was $4 after tax. Not only was it cheaper, but it was bigger and it tasted better.Sad it didn't live up the hype I imagined I would have for it.",4.0,3.0,350,2017-11-05,43.653653,-79.390943,"Japanese , Noodles"
Manpuku Japanese Eatery,"This is small eatery inside a food court. Great place to grab some quick eats for cheap. I bookmarked this eatery for some time now and finally got a chance to try it. I came with a friend during dinner hours. We stepped inside and we stood there for a few minutes. Several waiters walked by us but nobody approached us. We were confused because this place looked very casual, so I wasn't sure if we grabbed our own seats (there were several empty tables) or we wait to be seated.We kept waiting but none of the servers approached us. We finally asked a server we are waiting for a table, and she asked how many, and we told her we needed a table for two. Finally we got a table. The initial impression wasn't great because of the lack of service. Food:Manpuku ramen (2.5/5) : This was okay, I generally prefer going to a ramen restaurant to get ramen. But I was curious to try it here. It was very bland, and I would definitely not order this again. Yakionigiri (3.5/5): This was my favorite item. The rice was crisp on the outside. A nice side dish to add to any order.Yakisoba (3/5) : This was alright. A bit too salty though.Takoyaki (2/5): I was looking forward for this the most, but this was actually the most disappointing dish out of everything we ordered. It wayy too sticky and heavy.Overall, the food was okay. But I didn't expect anything great given its a casual eatery with cheap prices.

Manpuku Japanese Eatery,"You get food worth far more than what you pay, I can guarantee you that. Manpuku Japanese Eatery has been known for their udon dishes and YES THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT. The Niku Udon (Beef w/ Udon) and the Tsukimi Udon (Wakame Seaweed, Tempura Bits, and Fried Egg w/ Udon) were ordered by me and a friend, the 3rd person ordered Gyuudon (Beef Rice Bowl). I'm going to have to say that all were worth their price if not more and I love handling my money wisely and this place's QUALITY & QUANTITY for under $10 makes me want to live here (almost).The Niku Udon was a light broth with perfectly cooked thin slices of beef. You can't go wrong with its simplicity here.The Gyuudon was a simple rice bowl dish with lightly stir fried slices of thinly cut beef and there was plenty of enough flavour and juices for my friend to enjoy it. However, they're an extremely big eater so it didn't fill them up as much as they'd like.It would be cool if they had a regular size and a larger size with an extra dollar or two and I would definately pay for it too.The Tsukimi Udon I ordered was BLISS. Heavenly bliss. The tempura bits added that familiar sweet flavour I would get in ebifry, the wakame had that refreshingly salty sea flavour, and the egg was the perfect amount of protein addition! The broth flavour was light enough to perfectly hold the entire bowl together. A homey, perfect symphony in my mouth.The thing is with Udon VS Ramen is that even if you did order thicker ramen noodles, udon noodle's thickness still wins in the long run. Thinner noodles are meant for more flavour packed broth like Miso based broths. Udon noodles are already so thick that being in a light broth and subtler flavours makes you enjoy the dish as a whole lot better and Manpuku executes this elegantly. Did I forget to mention how cheap it is to fill me up???I also ordered the Fish Cakes made with burdock root and it was SO GOOD. Felt so right at home with this side dish to my udon.My friends finished off the HOMEMADE flans they make here and licked every last drop of the caramel, it was so good ugh!!!!!!!!!!!! I couldn't get one because my friend ordered the last one sobs...They also sell japanese snacks up at the front and I love their cheesecake! INFINATELY BETTER THAN UNCLE TETSU's SUGAR JOKE OF A CAKE!

I don't think they've changed prices, like ever. My favourite dish here has got to be the Unagi-don (Eel on a bed of rice).

I decided to get the curry beef udon which is a pretty good price at 5.99. It came within probably 10mins. The first taste was a bit spicy but after a while it was just udon with beef, potatoes and a diluted curry broth. I liked the potatoes but the beef was kind of dry. It is a great comfort food dish.Afterwards, I decided to try their matcha red bean dorayaki which is a nice sweet ending to the meal. Emphasis on the sweet. It was really sweet, especially for me who enjoys dessert and bubble tea, so I'd pay a bit of caution towards that.

Manpuku Japanese Eatery,"I ordered the curry beef udon and I thought the curry sauce was too much. My friend ordered the udon with just the beef and onion, and I preferred that dish because the broth was lighter and nicely flavoured.We also got the rice triangles wrapped with seaweed, and (canned) tuna inside. I wouldn't order it again. It was just a big ball of rice with less than a teaspoon of tuna inside. On my way out, saw the cute japanese pancake looking things wrapped in plastic. I tried the sesame one, and it was not good. It's like sponge cake but tastes stale. Service was very friendly.

The oysters were fresh and all but again, they were very small and unsatisfying.  I will probably return to try out other selections on the menu but definitely not for their 100 oyster special!The service was good and they didn't rush us at all.

Pearl Diver,"LOVE LOVE LOVEI came here a while back in the summer and was blown away here!My hunni loves seafood, so I chose this restaurant downtown when I knew we were going down for errands. When you walk in you are greeted by a beautiful and dim restaurant. It has a bit of a romantic feel, but with more energy. It can be a great date place if you don't mind it being a bit loud. We were seated promptly ( since I made a reservation) and were lucky to get a booth that was like a bench, where we sat on one side with the table infront of us. Making it a bit more intimate for us (which was nice). The waiter was helpful and knowledgable with the menu and was attentive and excellent during our meal. Now the food:Of course, one needs to order the seafood tower at pearl diver, because you need to bask in it's holy glory at least once in your life. The tower is damn beautiful, with two tiers of seafood beauty.On the top tier you have your shrimp cocktail, salmon and king crab legsOn the bottome you have your assortment of oysters with 3 dipsFRESH AF pretty much sums up the tower. JUST TRY IT. Chicken Liver & Oyster PateI really enjoyed this, but my hunni thought it was a bit weird. I mean it seems like a weird combo, but I thought it was a great savoury dish. So i think this is probably a hit or miss item. It's pretty difficult to explain the taste of the pate, but it's oyster so... if you're adventurous or an oyster lover, go for it!Cured Fish PlateAssorted and served with rye breadFresh. not the highlight but still a great appetizerSticky Toffee PuddingThe hype about it is true. It's a decadent dessert that really hits the spot after the meal, the pudding is soft and melts in your mouth. ** we also ordered two cocktails but I forgot the names, but they were both very good and would 100% recommend**Overall, I had a great time here !! I liked the food, atmosphere and had a great waiter.

Pearl Diver,"More of a 3.5, not yet a 4. Had dinner with my relative on a Friday evening. Made reservations and requested to be near the window, which they accomodated. My relative was surprised about the nice table she got, not knowing I had already requested it. lol. We ordered the following:FOOD- Seafood Tower (regular market price, about $60-65) which consists of the top layer (crab legs, mussels, tuna) and bottom layer (oysters, I believe half fanny bay and half malpeques). I have to say, I was not won over by the Seafood Tower. If I had to order again, I would likely just do oysters only. They were very fresh and would definitely recommend. I was okay with the crab and tuna but the mussels tasted a bit rubbery to me. Did not enjoy them too much. - Pearly chowder (small plate $8.00) with double smoked bacon, potatoes,and clams was good and filling. I liked that it was creamy and smooth. DRINK- The mojito was not to my liking, which was surprising but I think the ratio of mint and rum was just off. Not sure, but it just tasted off to me. For the price, I was disappointed. I think its a bit cheaper than the shirmp cocktail ($16) but I probably should have ordered that instead. SERVICE - Good, cleared table off promptly and refilled water. Did not take long to come back and get any additional orders in. Overall, would I come back? I think so but I dont know if I would do any big outtings or celebrations here as I just had an okay-good experience but not a great one. Also, place is quite small so its challenging if you are thinking of booking big groups. They might be able to accomodate if you book ahead to either put tables together near front of resto or get one of the long tables with high chairs in the middle of the resto. Also note, bathrooms are down a steep flight of stairs in case mobility is an issue. Not on same floor.",4.0,3.0,448,2018-01-02,43.65157,-79.37377,"Seafood , Comfort Food , Breakfast & Brunch"
Pearl Diver,"Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday and we had a great time here. We ordered the seafood tower as our appetizer (around $66) - delicious! Then I ordered the fish & chips ($19) - can't go wrong with this staple but I recommend you choose something different and unique if you come here. My partner chose the Steelhead trout ($30) - was a bit too soupy he said. The food are delicious though slightly on the pricey side. One of our other friend ordered the Pickerel ($30) - that looks even better, I would recommend that over the trout. They sat us at a big table near the back of the restaurant, so it was nice and intimate setting for two groups of people. Although the room is at the back, the waiters frequently peeked their head into the back to make sure we're doing okay. Our waiter was kind.

I do not typically enjoy fish, but I enjoyed this one a lot. The noodles and soup that came with it were just alright. I thought the fish would taste better on its own instead of being served on top of the soup. I did not like the meal was not filling enough, considering the price. I got that it was a seafood restaurant, but I wished I was full after leaving the restaurant. Next time I may just go for the fish and chips.The server was attentive and also helpful.

Pearl Diver,"Great seafood restaurant hidden in the east end, located at Adelaide and Church. They have great daily specials if you dine in at those specific times. We went on a Saturday evening so naturally there wasn't going to be a special during peak hours. I ordered the seafood tower at a price of $66 which includes a dozen oysters, two snow crab legs, ahi tuna, pickled mussels and 4 cocktail shrimps. It was a great platter to share but could have done without the crab legs, mussels, shrimp and perhaps add more oysters so you're able to try out different kinds. I ordered the grilled octopus which will run you $19, the octopus was over grilled and you could taste the char which was a little disappointing.I ordered the scallops, which is seared wonderfully except they add this jam to the scallops which is unnecessary and takes away from the scallops taste. All in all, it is a great place but if you want to try some more unusual things it will run you a few extra $.",4.0,4.0,448,2017-11-16,43.65157,-79.37377,"Seafood , Comfort Food , Breakfast & Brunch"

Pearl Diver,"Sooooo...came on the oyster night, but didn't get the oysters (which are probably the biggest draw for this place). The first thing I noticed was the restaurant is WARM. It was a very warm day in the city, and walking into the restaurant, I was praying for the sweet embrace of AC, but was greeted by more stuffy warmth. It's a quaint spot, and service is alright, albeit detached and needed to be prompted (we had to ask for water on several occasions). We ordered the oyster and chicken pate (this was good, though I think I prefer classic pate). We ordered the sardines (SOOOOO MANY BONES), the mussels (these were actually delicious, in a coconut curry sauce + fries were shoestring fries that were well fried), the calamari (this was interesting with a super crispy coat, but was very batter coating heavy, with little squid), and the fish and chips (same fries which were good, batter is very thin and overly oily, with a strong fishy taste....there is definitely better in the city!) Drinks are quite pricey, so not the best place to drink, but beers on tap have specials, and they have 7$ glasses of house wine.

The trout was served in a savoury ginger & kelp broth with soba noodles, shitake mushrooms, baby boy choy and a sesame honey glaze. It was not what I had expected, but it was a delicious and a pleasant surprise. The mussels was delicious. The broth was savoury. You will need to ask for bread to mop up the broth.

El Catrin Destileria,"A group of 10 girls came to El Catrin to celebrate a friend's birthday.  The feeling amongst the group was that the food was underwhelming and overpriced and we felt that the restaurant was not able to handle a big group, despite the fact that the area where we were seated had a few long tables to accommodate larger groups.  I'll start with the food.  They did advise us that portions are on the small side as the restaurant is tapas style and the intention is that the food be shared.  I felt the price point did not reflect the fact that the portions are miniscule.  For example, the guac is intended to be a portion for 4 people.  At $13.50 for an order of guac and chips, the portion was tiny.  I think this should be properly advertised as a portion for two guests.  I liked how the waitstaff mashed the avocados in front of us but it looked like only about half an avocado, which is tiny for 4 guests to share.  The chips tasted like Frito Lays out of bag whereas at other Mexican establishments in the city you can tell that the chips are baked in house.  I felt the guac was missing some lemon/lime and garnish.  I did appreciate that our waitress walked everyone through the menu and recommended substitutions.  I shared the couscous salad which was delicious but also tiny for $11.  I ordered the chicken almond mole as my main as recommend by our waitress. The chicken was good but the vegetables underneath were practically inedible (I actually spat them out!).  The menu described the side as squash but nothing on my plate resembled squash.  While I didn't personally order tacos, I heard my friends complaining about the fact that the tacos are 2 for $12 and you can't mix and match.  In my opinion, they should be priced as 1 for $6 so guests can try different varieties. More importantly than the food itself (since ultimately when you are a large group, the focus should be on the company), we felt that while our waitress was extremely patient, that the restaurant was not able to accommodate a large party.  At the end of the meal, one bill came out.  As you can imagine, at a restaurant that is tapas style many of the dishes were shared so it was a scramble to remember who ate which dish (not to mention many of the menu items are in Spanish so it can be difficult to decipher which items belonged to which guest).  I appreciate it is not the waitress' job to remember who shared which dishes but I think at the outset of the meal, she ought to have warned the group so we could have paid some more attention to prepare for settling up the bill.  For a restaurant that seems to attract large groups, I am surprised that they were not able to issue separate bills.  I wouldn't have even minded if some items that were shared were on one guest's bill and the guests could sort that out themselves.  But one bill for close to $550 for 10 people to sort out ...  Even two bills would have worked! I am always somewhat forgiving in a large group at a restaurant but felt in this case the food was poor so therefore I will not be returning.",3.0,2.0,658,2018-01-06,43.650741,-79.358017,"Tapas/Small Plates , Mexican"

El Catrin Destileria,"I was a little apprehensive about this place, given there are some negative reviews. But the fact that this place is packed on a Monday night speaks volumes. Aside from the expansive and cosy patio they have here, the interior of the restaurant is simply gorgeous - Giant tequila/liquor wall at the bar area, colorful decor, edgy wall art, rustic wood tables, to the Mexican wrestling mask in black lighting - all give a very fun and energetic vibe. It is very clear you will have a fun time here.Of course, good decor means little if the food is not up to snuff. Me and my dining companions had a tasting of various dishes. We were started off with some guacamole and chips, with the avocado smashed at table side. It came with a variety of sauces from mild to hot, and also some crickets in a mild chili oil. The guac was very fresh and tasty, and it was neat to try the crickets which are very rich in protein.The Atun Ahi tuna ceviche - with watermelon, Yucateco mignonette, lime and chives, was light and refreshing. It went well with some chips as well and got the appeitite going.The Esquites were surprisingly good - made with charred corn off the cob, epazote, chiptole aioli and lime. Even though it's in a shot glass, it is a warm dish, and the flavour of the freshly grilled corn with the aioli was amazing! I would say this is a must-get.Sopes de Tinga - pulled chicken chipotle with tomato stew, black bean puree, lettuce, crema fresca, queso cotija on corn flour masa. This was delicious as well and well worth trying.Pescado Nayarit - Grilled beeline snapper that is marinated in chile ancho, served whole and de-boned. Came with corn tortila, avocado and salsa martajada. A great dish if you feel like having some fish tacos.Pollo Almendrado - Chicken supreme in almond sauce, fried plantains, chayote squash, sauteed zucchini. This was my favorite dish of the night. The chicken was prepared perfectly and was moist and tender. It had a nice crispiy skin, and the almond sauce was really delicious with it. Everybody at the table loved it and I would put this on the must-get list as well.For dessert, we had some churros - they were pretty large, and yet very light and airy which are perfect. Easily the best churros I have ever had. We also had the Xocolatl (Mexican mousse, candied confir papaya and almond brittle). Surprisingly the Xocolatl was our least favorite item of the evening, as we were expecting something sweet at the end but it was not that sweet at all.Throughout the night we also had various drinks and they were all quite delicous. We split a pitcher of their margheritas and all drinks were made strong and definitely worth getting.Even though some reviewers have noted that this place is ""pricey"", I really don't think it is considering the location and the environment. I thought items such as the tacos and the chicken mole were pretty on par with most restaurants that are not located in touristy areas.Overall, we enjoyed our night at El Catrin immensely.

What I can tell you though, is that I left here STILL HUNGRY and in a terrible mood. I went next door to the bakery after ""eating"" here and ordered a Pear and Brie grilled cheese sandwich. So, if you are still hungry after coming here I would recommend doing the same. (Looking at reviews after the fact, I'm not the only one who has left here hungry).- Guac and chips: these were pretty good and fresh. Adding crickets to it was a fun novelty. I can't say that it was the best though. - Pork tacos: 3 SMALL tacos. The shells and meat were SO DRY and lacked flavour. It was also made with cilantro and that's all I could taste. That might just be a flavour preference for me, but it was definitely a combination of the aforementioned. I couldn't even force myself to eat it.I had originally wanted to order the Love Boat (plantains and braised beef) after seeing it in reviews, but when I couldn't find it, I asked the waitress and she told me it was on the dinner menu. We had arrived late in the afternoon at about 3:15pm. After looking back, our meals were served at 3:45pm. Huge bummer that the lunch menu ends at 4pm. If I had come just a little bit later I could have gotten the Love Boat :( It's a possibility that maybe I could enjoy the dinner menu more, but I won't be jumping at coming back here. The decor and restaurant is super trendy and unbelievably well decorated, but I would rather eat in the broom closet if it meant I would actually get good food.",3.0,1.0,658,2017-09-24,43.650741,-79.358017,"Tapas/Small Plates , Mexican"
El Catrin Destileria,"I had a great experience here. The atmosphere is nice, and even though the place was crowded, I could still hear all 5 of my friends around the table fine. We came for lunch at 2:45 on a Saturday and service was timely. I got the esquites as an appetizer and was not disappointed! Perfect balance of flavors. I also got the pastor tacos which were very good. Combined with my esquites, I had a very happy palate. We also got a strawberry margarita pitcher, which was $65 CAD with 10 oz. of liquor. Delicious!!! With lots of fresh strawberries .The only downside of this place was the portions. I paid $17 for 3 tacos that were definitely on the smaller side--luckily, I get full easily, but my friends who don't fill as easily were still hungry after  their main entree. And unfortunately, the $17 tacos, which are a bit small, do not come with a side. It is still good food, though.",3.0,4.0,658,2017-12-30,43.650741,-79.358017,"Tapas/Small Plates , Mexican"

El Catrin Destileria,"It was a while since I was here and I invited my girlfriend to join me and try out the food. By my recommendation she ordered fish tacos and while she was eating it I asked her how it was and she was like well its a kind of hard, the breading was hard, I guess she was too polite to admit that it was a rock hard, but she managed to eat two of the tacos and maybe because she didn't want to tell me that my recommendation sucked, she was like, would you like to have my 3rd one as I'm already full. Little did I know! I made my first bite and OMG it was hard as a rock. I have tried fish tacos before here and they were excellent but this?!!! I took the knife and cracked this breaded fish piece open like a coconut, it took some good strength to crack it and once I did, there was no fish in the middle it was a sold rock hard over fried piece of breading, which I think the chef put into the oil to fry and went for a break.... I did call the waitress and told her that it was not suppose to look like that and we wouldn't not be paying for it, but you know what after such a horrible experience If I were a manager I would offer to pay for our whole meal. The waitress did ask if my friend wanted to order something else but I guess she's had enough of food (no wonder) and ordered some tequila instead. Poor girl... I felt so bad. I had shrimp taco and they were not bad and of course my mayan margarita was excellent as well as the dessert. I wanted to bring my boyfriend here sometime soon as he's never been but after this experience I'm a bit worried if he gets something like that on his plate. The food is quite expensive and I would imagine someone has to look after the quality of dishes which get out of the kitchen to the dinner table. Sign....

The patio was very nice especially on a nice summer day. The wall mural inside the restaurant was so pretty! We ordered the gazpacho ( avocado) and the Huevos cazuela. The soup was minty and full of flavor and a hint of lime at the end of each sip. Would definitely order that again next time.The Huevos cazuela was small but the pot was so cute! It was served with 3 poached eggs along with some black beans, bacon bits and tomato base... kind of like a chili.  At $14, it wasn't as grand as usual brunch menu items but it was delicious!

El Catrin Destileria,"Came here a while back and it didn't really meet my expectation despite all the rave reviews.  You see a lot of other reviews about this restaurant saying that what they got left them still hungry which is unfortunately true. Got the Baja & Polo Con Mole tacos as our mains and chips and guac for the appetizer.  Expect to pay around $15 for three tacos & $12 for chips/guac (pretty steep) and have them leaving you to want more.  Not exactly for the taste (they're good) but you're still hungry.  They definitely need to step up on the portion sizes to justify the means of their pricing.  The restaurant has a nice vibe and everyone is in a good mood.  The service is slow and there are numerous other great Mexican restaurants out there in Toronto that makes this one skippable.  Come here for the vibe & great talks with friends but other than that, El Catrin doesn't live up to the hype.",3.0,2.0,658,2017-10-06,43.650741,-79.358017,"Tapas/Small Plates , Mexican"

Cocktails were fab, we had one at the bar while waiting 15mins for our table and another with our meal. While our food was slow the waitress recognised this and was very attentive keeping us up to date.The big but is that the food just isn't great, we both found the meals bland, the table side guac was the same and the chips were stale. Maybe 3 is a little unfair and if this was a bar not a restaurant I could forgive the food.

Three Hands,"As most of my reviews go I like to focus on the place as a whole. For starters, I never heard of the place until I met the owner. He is a well rounded and friendly individual, which can be seen in how he approaches his food selection and interior design. The menu is a mix of comfort food meets Toronto culture/cuisine. It is a nice fusion! In terms of location, ambiance, food, and service, here is what I thought:Location - considering the ample amount of street parking and the streetcars passing by every 15 minutes or so, the location is very convenient and easily accessible. Ambiance - the location gives a very relaxed and friendly vibe. The attire is casual and the interior design is well put together and welcoming to all. It has sufficient lighting and music to make the experience a memorable one. Food - I ordered three dishes and glass of red wine. I ordered Jerked Octopus salad, Collard Green poutine (vegetarian option) and the kale salad. 1) Jerked octopus - was very tasty. The jerk flavor was the right amount and the octopus, which is typically very hard to cook properly, was really well done. I was impressed because the last few experience with grilled octopus was disappointing because it came out rubbery and overdone. For sure this place knows how to prepare a great grilled octopus. I recommend it if you like this kind of seafood.2) Collard Green Poutine- I had no idea what to expect but what I knew going in is that I grew up eating and loving collard greens and poutine so combining them would probably be a good thing. It was. I recommend. The flavors of the collards and poutine all complemented one another very well. 3) Kale Salad - YUM! just order it and eat it. The caesar-type dressing, which I had to ask for some to go, was well made. The kale is fresh and the fried capers, grilled grapes, and parmesan cheese really make a good combination. Thoroughly enjoyed the dish.Hope this review helps you out.",4.0,5.0,26,2018-01-20,43.649828,-79.433001,"Comfort Food , Cocktail Bars"
Three Hands,"This was one of our first stops while visiting Toronto & it set our trip off right. We found Three Hands with the help of Yelp! and I was a little suspicious when I walked into a mostly empty bar (around 9pm). It was a small space and there were a few solo diners. We sat at the bar & found the bartender/only server present to be very friendly and helpful. The menu was very small and eclectic, focusing on comfort foods. You can tell they put a lot of love and thought into the few options available. We had the collard greens poutine and jerk wings. The poutine was INCREDIBLE. It was like thanksgiving dinner over French fries. I will likely think about this dish for a long time when I remember my time in Toronto. The jerk wings were so.freaking.spicy!! I wish we had been warned. The wings were served with sliced scotch bonnet peppers on top and I dug right in.... To have my lips screaming. I love spicy food, but this was painful. We picked off the peppers and tried to enjoy the rest of the wings. The flavor was on point otherwise.They offer canned beer (tallboys) and cocktails. The Pimms Cup was absolutely delicious.

Three Hands,"So we were wandering up and down Dundas at the tail end of this year's Dundas West Fest and all the vendors were shutting down, thus foiling our attempts to find something delicious to eat. We happened to find ourselves in front of Three Hands and as we made our way inside, we were told that it was the business' very first night in existence.It was definitely a party atmosphere inside, and we were told that service might be slow. Undaunted (and hungry), we went ahead and ordered the Moule Frites and Deep Fried Olives (which were two of the only things left on the menu).(I should mention that service wasn't at all slow and that the food arrived surprisingly quickly.)The Deep Fried Olives (crispy olives, roasted pepper + pistachio romesco) were an unexpectedly delicious delight. I was anticipated something battered to oblivion, but what we got was a small, sparingly-battered appetizer that benefited from a thoroughly tasty dipping sauce. I could've munched on these things all night.The Moule Frites (white wine mussels, crispy parm fries) were far more exciting and delicious. I'd never sampled this classic Belgian dish and now I can hardly envision it being done better. The parmesan-crusted french fries were just about perfectly done and the mussels were equally yummy. And, as if that weren't enough, the bottom of the bowl contained this scrumptious broth that I literally drank when all the food was gone.Three Hands is a very cool, very small hole in the wall that certainly exceeded any expectations I might've had.",4.0,5.0,26,2016-06-18,43.649828,-79.433001,"Comfort Food , Cocktail Bars"
Three Hands,"Ok, so I read all the 5 star reviews and got suspicious, thinking ""they have their friends write reviews to bump up the average"".  Then I ate there, became a friend, and am writing them a 5 star review, so maybe I was right!That is to say that the only thing that matches the quality of food is the personable nature of the Three Hands who operate this establishment.  A family run business, they feel very down to earth and accessible and the food.... Oh, if I could spell food with 4 or 5 o's, like foooood, it would be fitting in this case.  I had the best burger I remember having, the octopus salad was scrumptious and I'm the last guy to trust a tentacle to taste good.  It's melt in your mouth and flavourful.  The salt/vinegar brussel sprouts had the folks across the pond in Brussels cheering.... the truffle fries were fantastic, and the fried chicken was fantastic too!  Literally every dish on the table was a 4.5 or 5.  Incredible food.At certain times of the night you can see light emanating from the kitchen, sparks flying out from it, thunder and lightening shaking the establishment and old, half-forgotten chants being sung as the chef works his magic in the back.  I think the burgers are made from unicorn meat.  Anyway, it was a magical night with really, really, really, good food.  Thanks Three Hands!TIP: If you visit, walk with a trophy.  You will want to leave it for the chef and staff.  Just my two cents.",4.0,5.0,26,2017-04-24,43.649828,-79.433001,"Comfort Food , Cocktail Bars"

Split the brussel sprouts with a friend and they were pretty good but nothing above and beyond what I've had at other restaurants. I was deciding between the jerk wings and the jerk octopus salad and went with the octopus. It was cooked fine, but it literally had no flavour - definitely not jerk, but no other seasoning or spices that I could discern. It was served with shredded greens, orange slices and some type of yogurt, all of which were extremely bland. Maybe it was an off night? I was really disappointed in it to the point where I thought about sending it back, but felt bad as I know it's a small family-run place. I ate it, was still hungry after and ended up grabbing a shawarma on the way home. Not ideal. Cocktail was good (dark and stormy). Seems like wine isn't their thing (only one type of VQA red/white available) which I didn't love - it'd be nice if there was at least 4-5 different types available for non-beer people.

Black Briik Restobar,"Damn near 5-stars across the board so who am I to break the love-fest over this new-ish addition to the Dufferin-Grove neighbourhood. Admittedly, we were looking for somewhere to grab a quick lunch prior to visiting some friends in the area, we had been cruising Bloor and refreshing Yelp to find something.We had passed a pizza place a couple blocks earlier and decided to pull over and park and walk back. However, we ended up finding parking directly in front of Black Briik and their sandwich board hilariously said that they had Brunch and A/C on the menu today. With the 40C heat, it was a wise bet, because we quickly crunched the numbers on walking 2 blocks in the heat vs eating at the place that was advertising A/C. Easy decision.It's a smaller restaurant with maybe 20-25 seats set in a mix of high-top tables, regular tables and some bar seats but its industrial design with some modern flair (inclusive of a Toronto skyline mural done by a local middle eastern artist) gave it warm big restaurant feel.One of the owners (Frances I believe his name was) was our server and offered us both the lunch and brunch menus. After some debate, my SO went with the Dirty Corn Hash (sans ham and with scrambled eggs) while I oped for their Juicy J Burger with well-done crispy fries.Being pregnant my SO is definitely well in tune with her taste buds and loved the Hash from first bite, unlike traditional versions the chef at BB mixed it up with an almost curry-indo/asian spice blend which was subtle but fragrant, I had a bite and it was fantastically different from the normal brunch offerings around the city. And served with thick/sweet/buttery slices of brioche type bread, mamma and our baby to be were VERY satisfied.As mentioned, my main was the burger and fries, not the healthiest option but what the hell - Yolo right? I ate the fries first because I LOVE well-done fries when they're hot. These were something else, I know it's hard to rave about fries but there was an amazing seasoning either on the fries or p[erhaps it was just the flavours of the oil on them, but they were amazing. Also, while I cannot confirm the science on this, they somehow cleared up my raging heartburn that I had been suffering from all day. The burger was excellent as well, a large fresh bun, topped up with a juicy pattie (NOT cooked well done - thank god). The food was excellent but it was the owner that really sold the place for us, taking time at the end of our meal to have a great conversation with us about the coming baby, his excitement over the restaurant's success thus far and even a little fantasy football chat for me. He was super nice to the point that I kinda felt like I should have given him a hug as we left... I don't know why, he just gave us both a real warm reception.This was the happiest meal mistake I've made in ages and one of the best lunch/brunches we've had in awhile.

Black Briik Restobar,"A small get together with Yelp Elites were proposed by Peter L., and about 9 of us made it to the Black Briik.  It was in unofficial-UYE.Located just east of Dufferin on Bloor, it's an interesting area that has seen it's fair share of gentrification.  Lots of bars and small restaurants have been popping up in the area and since this is not my stomping grounds, I will probably not be able to get to many of them.  Luckily, many of us made it down to share a few drinks, try some good pub food, and share stories.When you walk into Black Briik - just to make sure you know, the restaurant bricks on the outside is painted in a very deep black and yes, you could miss it in the dark, it is a small place with one awesome wall mural.  The mural covers most of one side of the restaurant and it is of the Toronto skyline.We had their ""TM"" Black Briik Hot Dog, which is their take on the corn dog.  Deep fried Mac&Cheese, Wings, Chicken and Waffles, and fried cauliflower were among the other dishes.  Much like a lot of pubs, I found that there was way too many items in the deep fried category - I'd like to see if they will be coming up with some lighter fair.Though they indicate that they are a Restobar, I think I would call them a gastropub.  None the less, the food was good, Francis the owner is hoping to expand closer to where I live - Cool!  The service was great, and it's always good to have great company when out on the town.  It was really nice to see a bunch of like-minded Yelper-nauts!Cheers!",4.0,4.0,23,2017-12-02,43.660093,-79.433138,"Bars , Canadian (New)"
Black Briik Restobar,"Black Briik is 1 of 2 reviews that I had not yet gotten around to writing, so I returned last night for another visit to watch some of the Sunday night football game. Similar to my two previous visits, it was late on a Sunday night and only a few other people were there. The space is deep and narrow, with a black-and-white mural of the Toronto skyline on one long exposed-brick wall. There was music playing on my first two visits, mostly not songs that I recognized, but at least upbeat and not too loud. Last night, everyone was watching the football game, so no music at all. Each time I think that I have had the same server, who is quick to come over and quite friendly to everyone.On my first two visits, I particularly went to eat something as I had read they have a good late-night menu. I had the chili fries supreme ($11) on my first visit. They were quite good; there was lots of chili and spring onions with sour cream on the side, and the fries were crisp. I then had the mac and cheese bites ($9) the next time, and they were really delicious, crisp outside but cheesy inside with some kind of dipping sauce; I only wish there were more than five in the basket. Other menu items that I noticed were fried chicken, chicken and waffles, mushroom poutine, and  their own version of the corn dog. I am not sure if there is a different menu earlier, but most of the late-night food is definitely 'comfort food'. They seem to have a good selection of drinks, including a list of craft beers ($6.50) and ciders, and some cocktails and martinis. I did have a Caesar once, which was nice and spicy, but mostly I've had mixed drinks like rye and coke ($6). Overall, not a bad place to drop by late at night if you want something deep-fried to eat. I expect I will keep going back every once in a while.",4.0,4.0,23,2017-09-25,43.660093,-79.433138,"Bars , Canadian (New)"
Black Briik Restobar,"Now I was a bit hesitant to try this place because, yes, believe  it or not, I'm not too crazy about deep fried food, which was what their menu mainly offered. What I mean is I don't go looking for it.  Mhmm, go ahead blast me now.  Anyways! I wanted to give it a try because my boyfriend loves crispy/crunchy/deep fried goodness and I thought why not just give it a shot? We didn't order any drinks though because we were solely interested in their food. We ordered the briik dog, fried chicken, deep fried mac n cheese balls, and the avocado and bacon waffle sandwich. Oh my pearl, it was all godlike. Every bite, there was a tear of joy. I really loved the briik dog (their take on a corn dog), and apparently my boyfriend told me it's longanisa! Longanisa is a type of Filipino sausage that has a more of a sweet kick to it than other sausages. My favorite was the deep fried mac n cheese balls served with a marinara sauce. I thought it was strange at first, but wow! So crispy, so cheesy, so saucy when dipped in marinara. Next up was the fried chicken. This appetizer was their best seller as well and I can see why. Super crispy peppery exterior and a generous amount of drumsticks/wings. My least favorite had to be the avocado and bacon waffle sandwich. It was still good! But the other dishes were just too awesome. I guess I wasn't too crazy about the syrup on the sandwich, but that's just me. Service was very attentive: constant checking on us, refilled our waters, chatted with us etc. It's definitely a smaller joint and I can see this place getting jam packed easily on a typical weekend night. I went fairly early, so I was able to snag a table. They play a lot of 90s/2000s music with matching decor as well. I spied some Spice Girls posters, and picture frames of Dawson's Creek and Buffy the Vampire Slayer cast. Ah, back in the day huh?.Really nice concept, great service, cool music (I'm a 90s/2000s kid anyways!), bomb bomb food. I really recommend ordering a bunch of dishes to share and go with a small group!

Black Briik Restobar,"The Mushroom Gravy Fries and Brik dogs were really good and the service was really friendly. We got lots of good recommendations from the owner, or at least he seemed like he was the owner! The Brik dogs were battered and deep fried Longaniza, I think. We also got the deep fried cauliflower, but we were not a fan of those, they were a little undercooked, soggy, and also a bit bitter.We definitely could have gone without ordering that one.This is a nice place for a beer and a small deep fried snack with friends. It was really dark, but had a few TVs playing the Jays game. And it was strangely dead we went! I think we would go back if we were in the area and the other places around were closed...We had to take the deep fried cauliflower to go because it was way too much food for the two of us, so they packed it in a takeout box and put it in a Staples bag.

Black Briik Restobar,"I attended their grand opening and enticed a two friends to come along on the promise that there would be some good food to enjoy.I felt a good vibe in the restaurant the moment I stepped in with a 90s/2000s playlist pumping through the speakers, the exposed brick walls, and the combination of low and high top tables.  They have two large flatscreen TVs for viewing sports events but the placement doesn't make them the focal point of the room but it's very complimentary.  So if you came to just chill with your peeps then you can do that with the glow of the TV distracting you the whole time.The menu is full of their take on some classic pub and comfort foods.  It doesn't paralyze you with choices which I like because then I know that the dishes can be executed well.  The back page of the menu is a lot of variations on the theme of ingredients wrapped in waffles while the front page is filled with other deep-fried bites.The menu items are, in my opinion, family style so sharing is caring in this case! :-)All the staff were extremely friendly and came by to say welcome.  Service was great, warm, and on-point.We ordered a few items to share:1. briik dogs: their take on a corn dog but instead of just a hot dog, it is a longaniza sausage.  The longaniza sausage had lots of flavour and it was a pleasant enjoyable surprise.2. chili supreme fries: just a straight up pub dish that is piled high with fries and chili.  Done well.3. chicken and waffles: the waffle is sweet and they have definitely put their own twist on it.  The chicken was moist and it came skewered like a shishkabob.4. bacon avocado waffle sandwich: this was my favourite combo of the night.  I love avocado and it tasted great with the crisp bacon between those sweet waffle slices.Overall, I think Black Briik is a very solid and promising resto-pub with a good vibe.  You can just come in for a pint, eat some comfort food, watch the game, not watch the game, chill with friends etc.",4.0,4.0,23,2017-02-06,43.660093,-79.433138,"Bars , Canadian (New)"

Black Briik Restobar,"My friends and I visited Black Briik on a Sunday for brunch. The brunch menu was pretty standard - we had the eggs benedict, dirty corn hash, and pancakes. The wait was quite long for food (30+ minutes) - the restaurant was not too busy but there was only one server and given the wait times, there was likely only one chef. Timing was an issue, as the first dish was served long before the other two arrived. The eggs benedict were okay, although a bit sparse compared to the other dishes and a touch overcooked. The dirty corn hash came with two eggs sunny side up that still had uncooked egg whites, but was otherwise tasty and a good portion size. However, the pancakes came out burnt and drenched in syrup. The bottom side of the pancakes (i.e. the hidden side) was significantly more burnt than the top side, and we had it sent back. The pancakes were comped, but the fact that something that burned made it out of the kitchen is not a good sign for quality control. On the plus side, the prices were reasonable ($11-$13) and with some refinement, this could be a decent neighbourhood restaurant. However, given the wait times and the food quality, this is not somewhere that I would recommend going for brunch until they've gotten their processes more sorted out.",4.0,2.0,23,2017-11-19,43.660093,-79.433138,"Bars , Canadian (New)"

Sukhothai,"I've been craving Thai food a lot recently, I think. I came in here on a Saturday afternoon. It must've just open for lunch as I was the only one there. But that meant I got quick and friendly service. I really liked the good here. I thought the flavors we're really good here. I started with the crispy spring rolls which were delicious. Then I had the gaeng masaman. I loved the tamarind sauce it was made with, which have it a tartness that made it taste so good. I had a that ice tea to go along with all of this. The portion was huge, so needless to say, I had plenty of left overs. Which I glad do try to eat and saved for the next day. But the other reason was too make room for dessert. I ordered the cassava cake, which reminded me so much of cassava cake I used to eat growing up. This was very sweet though, and I wish they would cut back on the sweetness by half. But regardless, I still loved it.The meal was great overall. Other than the sweetness level of the cassava cake being too sweet, I thought the rice came served on a weird plate. It was too small to eat directly from. I guess I was supposed to mix it into the curry? But I prefer eating it where the curry is poured over there rice, I guess. They were happy to give me a bigger plate though, so I was able to happily eat it my way!Location wise, it's got maybe 15-20 seats. I suspect they'll have outdoor seating in the summer. But currently there are a small number of tables. I'd call ahead and make a reservation just in case, before coming",3.0,4.0,7,2017-12-15,43.653715,-79.354478,Thai
Sukhothai,"There's only around 20 seats or so- we got really lucky because we were seated right away and a line formed after us. We got the khao soi, pad Thai, beef satay skewers, Tom Yum soup, and masaman curry.We ordered medium spice for all of them, and was informed that the Tom yum soup is going to be a bit spicier than medium- our server was right. It was super rich and definitely packed best but had a nice smoky flavour. The khao soi was not spicy at all- probably because of the coconut milk base. It was delicious but quite small. The pad Thai is probably one of the best around the GTA. Could be personal preference, but it was just the right amount of tamarind and spices. Also not oily or overlooked. Skewers were pretty small as well- 4 for $12. Very thin but tender. Nothing too special. We had the shrimp masaman curry but I find that the rice that it came with was too small for all the curry they gave. We ordered extra rice just to soak up all the delicious curry. Even though it was medium spice, I'd have to say that it's spicier than the standard ""medium"" at most places. I eat quite spicy so this is just a warning to those who don't, based on my friends' reaction to the soup, curry, and pad Thai.",3.0,4.0,7,2017-11-29,43.653715,-79.354478,Thai

There were a ton of people in and out getting take-out and delivery though, it was almost non-stop!We started with the shrimp chips and tamarind dipping sauce ($5), this is easily my favourite reason to go to Sukho Thai, slightly peppery, really crispy, lots of shrimp flavour with the sauce that is a bit sour and salty - so satisfying and the perfect snack that I can't stop eating. The chicken coconut soup was good but it was just too sour (Tom Kha Gai, $12 for dinner portion with rice) I also got the Gaeng Masaman curry ($15), again it was a bit too sour and the beef was on the chewier side. But it was still pretty good and the potatoes were perfect soft spheres. I got medium, but it wasn't spicy at all. The Panang Salmon ($18)  was the best! Perfectly cooked, a good crust and still moist in the middle and it was a good portion. The sauce was creamy and the grilled asparagus was crispy and got that slightly charred taste which I like! It was almost $60 for 3 people, and we were all stuffed with a bit of leftover curry and rice to take home.

Nobuya,"I'll balance my review based on food, service, and atmosphere. For someone who runs a restaurant, I'll give it to Nobu that he makes good food.  There are not many Japanese places like his around the area. I've been here in total 5 times but it is no longer a top choice for me. Food: awesome. He nails each dish with Japanese flavour. Even for something simple like Karage it packs a punch. Simple clean options that can give you that happy feeling. Service: I don't care if he is a one man shop, for someone whose Japanese culture praises the idea of efficiency he fails. No information on where the food is. You have a huge margin of inconsistency for arrival of food. The pushiness is arrogant and to me yells desperation. It's very easy to make a simple appetizer dish that folks can nibble on while they wait. You cant expect to make people wait as long as he does. Maybe he's in a downward spiral and doesn't know how to get out. Who knows. Value comes from the experience. If Nobu just does something to offset the waiting with small snacks, then I think people would be willing to wait. But it's clear from the reviews this is a try it place without much commitment. If you are lucky enough to come when it's open, which I never know when it is, then absolutely try it out. But after that one round, I recommend you save your time and go to another place that actually puts as much effort into their hospitality as they do food because you sure won't get that here.",4.0,2.0,135,2018-01-22,43.614481,-79.497516,Japanese
Nobuya,"Average across the board. A small snack bar in a far off corner of Etobicoke, Nobuya left much to be desired. Tucked away, it was a little out of place, hidden from the hustle and bustle of the city. Limited parking in the back and side of the place. I came in with a decent level of expectations as I've heard many good things about their offerings. I left a bit of a flat note. I was accompanied by 2 other diners that night. The restaurants itself was not overly busy, though all seating were filled but there were about 10 diners in all. Service was understandable slow as there was only one front of house wait staff braving service. They offered various typical Japanese snacks, sharable but definitely will not fill a normal person up. Between the 3 of us, we ordered 5 dishes worked out to about $23 per person. We wanted a wide variety so we ordered Takoyaki, karaage, pork donburi, Japanese poutine, and okonomiyaki w/ yakisoba.First off, all the food were pretty much basted in the same mayo and unagi sauce, so very differentiation in taste between the dishes. The donburi was by far the table's fav. The rice was perfectly cooked and fluffy. The sauces worked well and the pork and egg was well marinated. The textures, flavours, and silky mouth feel left a nice sensation. It was missing a crunchy component but that's preference. The takoyaki was average or a little below. It was too doughy, too cooked and lack the crispy to the outer shell. The flavour was good and price definitely were some of the cheapest I've came across. Strangely, it came out at a manageable temperature to eat (normally takoyaki comes out lovingly scorchingly hot). The Karaage was not a favourite. Portion vs. price was a definite deterrent. The portion was on the small side. The chicken meat itself was bland and relies on the sauce and seasoning for flavour. It was strangely not crispy but chewy and tough. The ginger garnish did provide a nice and much needed contrast. The poutine was not a favourite either. The hand-cut style fries was nice and starchy but was limp for the most part. By the time the fries came we were pretty much bored with the same sauces and flavour profile. Cheese was a scarcity on the plate. The bonito flakes didn't add much but aesthetics. Last and least was the okonomiyaki and yakisoba. After the first bite, I gave up. The biggest issue I had was with the amount of oil that coated the dish. Next was the texture and overall execution. The okonomiyakis that I've has the chance to try were delicious; filled with cabbages and filling goodness to held together by a nice light batter. This okonomiyaki was very heavy with the batter, lacking fillings and notably formed using a mould of sort. The soba noodle had a toughness to it that was either pleasant or palatable.The overall meal was a little below average. I would rate the 2.5 stars. The service was friend but slow. 45 minute in, we were still waiting for food. However, once the food started to roll out, it kept consistent pace, so no complaints there. I would personably not return mainly due to location and price, but I would definitely say it worth trying...especially if you crave some Japanese snacks and can't go to north York or Toronto for your fix.",4.0,2.0,135,2017-03-15,43.614481,-79.497516,Japanese
Nobuya,"Haven't had such delicious food in a while. Ok maybe that's not entirely true but this food was refreshingly good!I've always wanted to check out Nobuya because I wanted to try okonomiyaki. I've watched too many YouTube videos of it so I was dying to try it. However, every time I wanted to visit Nobuya it's been closed. So tip#1: check out the hours on its website before heading over. Best would be to call and confirm. But like the tagline inside the restaurant reads, ""Nobuya, worth the wait..."" it's quite true. It was truly worth the wait. There's a flip side to it though: service is slow. The owner/chef works alone so it does take time for the food to arrive.My girlfriend and I ordered the Tsukune/Yakitori, which are deep fried chicken meatballs on a skewer with spicy mayo. These were solid. A bit oily sure but still very tasty. My girlfriend ordered the Chicken Katsu Donburi, which was good too. She couldn't finish it but she never finishes a dish anyways The star of the night was... *drumroll* Okonomiyaki  My god. Everything about this dish was perfect. The presentation, the variety of textures, the balance of flavours, the level of spice. I'm really glad the chef/owner recommended that I order it with Yakisoba because a) it was filling and b) the noodles really complement the okonomiyaki nicely. The chef/owner is the nicest guy ever. Although he's also a really good salesman. I wasn't going to get a drink but he somehow convinced me to get a Japanese carbonated drink which was $3.50  No worries though restaurant business is hard, I get it. All in all, if you haven't checked this place out please do so. Just make sure you check the hours before you go.

Nobuya,"Be prepared to wait a long time for what is supposed to be Japanese ""fast food"".The owner needs to take a course on customer service and anger management.  Given my experience, I have no doubt that many of the positive reviews on here are FAKE or manipulated as one reviewer mentioned.  The owner is a nutcase.  I'll tell you why...   Me and my wife were sat down at 7pm and provided menus.  Keep in mind that everyone is in plain sight and 25 mins later our order still wasn't taken.  Any attempt to have our order taken was in vain as he literally never once looked our way!  It was like we didn't exist and there was only one other table of 3 occupied in this small restaurant at the time.   No big deal, we were both hungry and given the options for ramen out there and the fact that the owner had not taken our order or didn't seem to care we decided to leave.     Walked into my vehicle and was in the middle of a conversation about where to go when we see the owner approaching our vehicle! This was amusing to me for a couple of reasons.  Firstly, he was the only person in the restaurant and he left his other customers in his restaurant alone.  Secondly, he looked like he wanted to fight!As this experience was in cookoo 'case study' territory, I will try to describe it as accurately as possible.    The man approaches my car and knocks on my window.  I open it.   Him:  ""why?"" Me: ""what are you talking about?"" Him: ""why?""Me: ""why what?""Him: ""why you go?""Me: ""because you took too long to take our order and my wife is hungry."" Him: ""I am only one person""Me: ""I don't care, that's not my fault"" Him: "" f__k you then!"" Me: ""f__k you too!""He then walks in front of my vehicle and yells at me: Him:""I call the police"" Me: ""for what?""Him: ""I call the police""Me: ""for what?"" (I was visibly amused at this point)Him: ""......""When he stood in front of my vehicle I honestly thought he was going to kick my vehicle as he looked really pissed off.  Last thing I was expecting was him to threaten to call the police lol.    Perhaps he was afraid of how I responded to his profanity? Perhaps it was because I wasn't intimidated by him? I guess I will never know, I really don't understand why he would say that.  I told him to get out of the way.  No response.  When I asked him the 2nd time he responded with another ""f__k you"" followed by a 5 secs stare before he finally moved out of the way.  As I was driving away I could see him in my rear view, the guy was looking at my car on the sidewalk as I was driving away like in those romantic movies! I'm not kidding here.  I could feel his eyes sending laser beam death stares that sent chills down my spine.  Ok, in all seriousness, our mindset after this experience was, ""what the heck just happened?"". I can understand him being upset if we ordered food and left.  It wouldn't justify his actions but I could understand.  What I don't understand is that he never took our order and acknowledged us after we were seated and when we decided to take our money elsewhere he got upset.  Add the fact that he tried to intimidate me and my wife and ended up feeling intimidated himself we have a definite WTF moment. Take my review for what its worth but it is the truth.  The owner has a few loose bolts.  Very amusing experience.",4.0,1.0,135,2017-10-02,43.614481,-79.497516,Japanese

Nobuya,"I've been here twice. The first time was an excellent experience, we didn't mind waiting for our food and when it did come, we were amazed. I got spicy miso ramen and my boyfriend got the udon, and we had croquettes on the side. The croquettes were so good that we ordered a second portion. The owner and waitress were really friendly and gave us free spring rolls. The noodle soups hit the spot.We tried visiting on 2 different occasions after but for some reason, the restaurant was closed. The hours shows that it should've been open but there was no notice of why it was closed. From there on, I always called to see if they were open because it seemed unpredictable.The second time we went, I took my sisters along so it was a table of 4. This experience wasn't the greatest because it took almost 2 hours just to get our food. We had our order taken in a fair amount of time, but food took way too long. The side door was also open and the cold wind kept blowing in where we were sitting.

Both dishes had tender and juicy chicken.The only reason I am giving 4 stars vs 5 is that with the take our box, the rice and meat ratio was a bit off, too much rice!

Nobuya,"let me start with HOW DOES THIS PLACE HAVE 4+ STARS?. Im new in the area and decided to trust my yelp recommendations and stopped by this restaurant.  When i approached to make an order the owner stated to me that in order to get my meal i need to order a side dish for 6.99+tax. The owner further stated that if i dont order the side dish it may take up to 40 minutes. So i ordered the udon and takoyaki. 1 hour passes by i still haven't received my order, mind you there was only about 4 people in restaurant. I then began to wonder why i paid the extra to get my food quicker and didn't even happen. So finally i get my order. The taste was extremely mediocre im convinced that owner mustve paid customers to make good ratings. So upon finishing my meal being unsatisfying of the service i recieved i decided not to tip the owner. Once exited the owner followed me into the parking lot and proceeded to act aggressive towards me demanding a tip. I kindly advised that tips are earned from service and he did not deserve any. The owner continued to act violent towards me and other customers from the restaurant came out to defend me. AVOID EATING THIS PLACE AT ALL COST THE OWNER IS VERY VIOLENT AND DISHONEST ALL HE CARE ABOUT IS MONEY.

The Tsukune (chicken patties) were more like meatballs, still tasty, but not exactly what I expected. The fish and chips are good, the coating is a little thick, but still super crispy and this fish is super moist inside; the tartar is delicious, though it's really the fries that take the cake for me...AMAZING FRIES!

Taverna Mercatto,"Taste: 4Service: 5Value: 1Presentation: 5Overall: 3.9 rounded up to 4Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. For starters we are trying out the fried calamari and meatballs. The main will be a veal parmesan with a side salad. Let's dive right into the review.The fried calamari wasn't a big plate but boy did it look good. Fried calamari is one of my favourite starters and this dish strengthened my claim. The meatballs were very tender on the inside but I would've prefered if the outer layer was slightly crispier. The veal parmesan looked sooooo good. The cheese was very stringy, but it kind of fell apart when I was cutting the meat. The side salad was surprisingly very impressive, arguably better than the parmesan (veggies over meat what am I thinking)!Italian food is generally on the more expensive side, and the costs on these menus were ferocious. I generally wouldn't come here too often unless somebody was willing to subsidize my meal ;)The service was fantastic. The waitress came by frequently to pour us water and check on how our meals were doing. Couldn't expect any less.In conclusion I enjoyed this meal and thought that it was very delicious. I would define this place to be one of the better food places around Union and am excited to try their pizza next time. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier.

Taverna Mercatto,"Catching up with my friend over lunch today. This place was packed even on a Monday, speaks for itself how popular this place is. The quality of food prevails - i ordered a Linguini di mare and my friend ordered a pizza. We always knew the quality of food is high but when it comes to accommodating client's dietary restrictions, they are not as flexible.  The lactose free options were quite limited and not left with many alternatives. My pasta was a bit disappointing- how could a seafood linguini not come with shrimps but only with small pieces of scallops, mussels and calamari? The pasta was al dente but the ingredients could be more robust. Their desserts are always to die for- the caramel icecream cup was to die for and so was their tiramisu! If i were to choose, i would jump right into desserts if possible! All in all a great place to catch up with friends!! Have fun and enjoy!!",3.0,3.0,115,2017-11-27,43.642672,-79.38276,Italian

It was a squid ink pasta with clams which was delicious and worthy of 5 stars on its own! It has been replaced with a shrimp bucatini with pistachio pesto which was alright.

My friend had a carbonara and I went for the squid ink. It was a bit underwhelming. The portion sizes were medium to small but the ambiance and service is really nice. Both of us agreed we'd had better pasta elsewhere. Maybe the pizzas are a better choice? There is definitely a mad lunch rush with all the offices around but there wasn't a wait which was nice.

Taverna Mercatto,"Venue- 5/5. Beautiful, classy interior and big sidewalk patio plus superb Italian food = a pretty solid night. Located in a touristy area between the ACC and Rogers Centre, TM is perfect for dates, family or friends gatherings, or touristy night out.Food- 4/5. There's not many vegetarian options unfortunately. Pescatarians can rejoice though - the platters feature many seafood options. I ordered the albacore tuna, which came on a bed of greens and green beans and boiled potatoes. The tuna steaks were fatty and well cooked, but smelled and tasted a bit too fishy imo. My partner ordered the margherita pizza, the only vegetarian pizza option unless you consider the salsiccia, which can become vegetarian by replacing the sausages with veggies. The crust was very thin and the dough was quite tasty. Reminded me of a via mercanti pizza. However, the cheese was so-so. Our favorite dish was the arancini appetizer - 3 fried risotto balls coating chewy provolone cheese on a bed of tomato sauce. Strongly recommend this dish - unhealthy, puts you into a food coma, but soooo delicious.Value- 3/5. Pricy, but reasonable for date night. Pizzas and pastas are $15-20 while protein platters hover $20-40. Tonight for two without drinks we spent $60. No complimentary bread here (though we never asked), so load up on orders!Service- 4/5.

I was really disappointed because after a $20+ meal, I would hope to feel at least satisfied, but I felt like I hadn't even eaten. I was kind of embarassed about this and thought that it must just be me who has a black hole stomach and was still hungry, but then the others in my party echoed my exact sentiments!

Taverna Mercatto,"There are such a small amount of times when you eat a meal like the ones they sell at Taverna Mercatto. Tonight, I ate the Duck Ragu and it was TO DIE FOR! The duck was fresh and tender, placed on top of a bed of thick pasta and melting shredded cheese on top. It was really a well crafted meal- I was considering hugging the chef! My family also ate the Spicy chicken, which was also EXTREMELY TENDER and FRESH. We also dined on fish- so fresh it was like they had just pulled it from the Sea. As my first time and meal in Canada, I hope that it will set the standard for food in Toronto. I would also like to thank the friendly and happy waiter that was very nice to my family and I. She made sure my water was filled and ready to drink! The atmosphere in this restaurant is happy and alive, you are guaranteed to smile. If you see this review...PLEASE GO HERE! YOU WILL WANT TO COME BACK!No, we aren't done yet... now let's talk dessert. I ordered the Gelato eSorbetto while the rest of my family ordered the Tiramisu, Budino, and the Canolo. It was okay...but if you REALLY want to order dessert, don't waste your calories on other desserts...GET THE CANOLO! IT IS SOOO GOOD! Crispy Canoli shell topped with powdered sugar. The filling- apricot mascropone with white chocolate and pistachio- was amazing! So, if you want dessert, ONLY GET THE CANOLO!-----------------------List of food I ordered (and recommend):1.

Agio,"Absolutely spectacular Italian food. Solid 5 stars. Walking into this restaurant feels like cottage, where it's a little run down, door is open, and washroom, I am short and the ceiling is low( never felt that tall before) Took me awhile to figure out the washroom as I was so focused on the bears hanging on the door.The chef's wife paints really well. There were paintings on the wall done by his wife and the portraits on the side are the frequent customers, painted by his wife.Table cloth was kind of like ones that your friend doesn't want but during university years, you will take it because you will take whatever is free. Having said all of that, the food was worth the lack of decor in the restaurant. It speaks for itself.Appetizer: The oyster mushroom has a beef/steak taste to it. It was smoky and flavourful. The lobster ravioli (I selected the one with alfredo sauce) was around $42 but the pasta was cooked al dente. Big chucks of lobster inside. Worth every penny. The clam pasta, you really have to eat it with the clams otherwise the pasta does not have enough flavours. I came in feeling not hungry but walking out wanting another plate of lobster pasta!!!!Tip: call to make reservations in advance, limited spots and chef is particular on that!",4.0,5.0,127,2017-08-11,43.676092,-79.450731,Italian

Agio,"I love this place. I think my only wish is for them to have much success! When we arrived I was a little skeptical because no one was there, but this place far exceeded my expectations.Staff: We were very politely greeted by their one and only server. Our water was constantly filled and they checked up on us often. Ambience: It definitely has character. I like the paintings all around the place and it's a very small and intimate place. Music was play overhead on speakers, it was nice. Don't get me wrong, it's not luxury fine dining, but something about this place has that charm that you just got to appreciate.Food: The highlight the restaurant is definitely the food. I can't really get over the food. I want more gnocchi from this place. We started with the daily soup (Cold Tomato Soup). It was packed with flavour and great acidity. Next we had the Bruschetta Trio. Each one was unique and simple in elegance but all very delicious. Then I had the Gnocchi Alla Boscaiola which was so delicious. It was freshly made gnocchi with a sweet and spicy sausage (I'm salivating just thinking about it again). So good!Thank goodness that I have friend who lives near by so I can come back often!

Agio,"I came back to Agio last night (a year later) from my last review. Most of my previous review still stands, but I definitely had a wonderful experience which is why I give this 5/5. This is not your typical, fast paced restaurant. The chef really makes each meal from scratch and alone, so yes, your meal in a bigger group or depending what you order may come out first before the others. It's definitely a homey feel. You really need to have patience if you want to eat here. For my experience, I thought the pace was great since we ordered lots!I made a 7pm reservation for Friday, and when I arrived only a table of 6 were in the restaurant. The server was really kind, and she gave us her recommendations. I had called in advance to ask for 2 orders of the lobster risotto, since I had a few colleagues rave about it recently and thought I just had to try. We also ordered caprese salad, fried calamari, linguine alla vongole - clams in white wine pesto sauce, spaghetti and meatballs, as well as the mushroom gnocchi. Yes - this many dishes shared between 4 people. We started with bread, as well as an app on the house (grilled zucchini with squash on top). Everything was delicious. I would prefer to try the grilled calamari next time though. In terms of the lobster risotto, it's not a traditional risotto but made in tomato sauce. If you love lobster, this dish or the lobster pasta is your ideal meal. It comes with a whole lobster! I would also recommend the linguine with clams, and the mushroom gnocchi was so delicious. Tasted fresh, and full of flavour.At the end of our meal, the Chef also gave us creme brulee on the house - also the best creme brulee I've ever had. Just the perfect crust, and the dessert itself wasn't overly sweet. I'll definitely be back and hopefully it would take me a year to do so.

There were only two staff on site, the lovely lady serving us, and the very friendly and kind chef. I had a mushroom pasta and it was really good, while my dining companion had a penne a la vodka dish and was impressed. They gave us a free appetizer (zucchini stuffed with squash - AMAZING), and that was actually my favourite part of the meal! The chef came out to speak with us as the restaurant wasn't too full, and he was super friendly and nice. He told us about how he was trained in Italy and lived there for many years, really cool.

Agio,"Ok so I admit I was confused when I walked in and saw a Korean chef.  But this guy is solid.  Trained in Italy and used to cook for the Pope (or his staff maybe?), allegedly, in his summer retreat (not the Vatican).  He spoke fluent Italian and was very proud of his Italian training as a chef.  The dishes were all made with the utmost care and there is indeed a sublime quality to his cooking that stands up to my need to eat at Angolino (which is presently shut down for renovations at the time of this writing).  It didn't disappoint.  I'm not sure which is better and I might have to do a blind taste taste of 5 or so dishes before I could truly say, but it's close enough to at last be a real close second, at worst.  There is a richness and purpose to his flavours and he comes across as a bit of a mad scientist (in all the good ways) and he's a fun and sympathetic character who will talk both of your ears off if you let him.  Great guy, great food and he really takes pride in what he does.  This is cooking with love.  I give 5 stars because there's no 4.5 option and if I had to round, I'd feel bad rounding down.  Yelp should allow half star ratings to get clearer averages imho.  Get your isht together already, Yelp!",4.0,5.0,127,2017-07-06,43.676092,-79.450731,Italian
Agio,"We visited Toronto from Colorado and this was our first stop after getting off the plane. It was a blessing and a curse as it was the best place we ate at during our trip so every time we got a mediocre meal, we swooned about missing Agio's dishes. We had to come back on our last day of the trip. The restaurant is quaint with paintings of regular customers done by the chef's wife. And what a great chef! I haven't had amazing food like this in ages! Pasta was perfect al dente and everything was at the perfect temperature. He brought us out some sort of complimentary zucchini and mushroom appetizer we didn't order but we delightfully devoured. Personally, I do not like zucchini or mushrooms but we had two dishes including them and they were delicious! That's how you know you have a great chef. They can make something you usually hate, taste amazing. Hell, I even learned the correct way to pronounce the dishes.

He ordered the carbonara. While we waited for our main meal chef Marino made us breaded cauliflower with a tasty home made dipping  sauce for us to try. He is very passionate about food and keeping the traditional Italian cooking. I should also mention Marino is Korean. He lived and worked in Italy for many years and speaks fluently Italian. The food was delicious and Marino's company was very entertaining. We finished the night with homemade creme brulee and a tasty drink of samboca and guava juice.

I went wife my wife and no I'm not some eating machine. The dishes were all perfectly seasoned. By that I mean they didn't leave my mouth dry because of too much salt. The gnocchi in particular was excellent. Nice and light without any starchiness. The chef is a real character and I encourage any potential diners to get to know him.

The man came up to me and said don't look at the menu, tell me what u want to eat and I can make it. Of course many things on the house - zucchini, and the amazing creme brûlée. Torching it in front of us and having us crack through the caramel to reveal fluffy cream eggs underneath. Blew my mind. He made great conversation about his learnings and opinions on random things.

Adamson Barbecue,"Probably my favorite BBQ joint ever. My only advice is to avoid coming on a weekend. I made that mistake and I had to wait in line for almost an hour and a half before I could order. That being said, for me to still give this place a 5 star review should say a lot about how I feel about their food.From the moment I stepped foot through the front door, I already start salivating because it smelled so good. Then when I finally got to try the beef brisket, pulled pork, and ribs, I was so impressed. Each meat was just so succulent, juicy, and flavorful in their own right. The homebrew sweet peach tea was also a nice touch to the meal - refreshing and well-steeped.

Adamson Barbecue,"I can't believe I've waited this long to try Adamsons brisket, without a doubt in my mind this is the best brisket I've ever had.Came here on Tuesday January 9th, arrived at 11:30 and to my surprise there was basically no line, I ordered a pound of brisket and a sausage, I tried to order the turkey or chicken but they were already sold out (30 minutes after opening their doors). There's plenty of seating so no worries about looking for a table. The food was amazing, the brisket broke up so easily without a struggle and the meat was perfectly smoked, the bark had a lot of spices that complimented the brisket. the sausage on the other hand was nothing special but it was still good, I honestly only got it because they ran out of half chickens :(. I used their house bbq sauce to get thru the sausage lol. I also got a potato salad which was pretty good but not sure how much better a standard potato salad could get.Staff are friendly and quick to explain the menu to new-comers, it seems like they really enjoy what they do! Please note that the place is pretty much hidden from the public so all their business is from the workers of the surrounding area and word of mouth. Given that they are pretty much always busy and sell out before 2-3PM that alone should tell someone how good their food is.",4.0,5.0,131,2018-01-10,43.712476,-79.353066,Barbeque
Adamson Barbecue,You know they say brisket is the measure by which to know if a bbq joint knows what they are doing and i find that to be absolutely true. The brisket here is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! I have never had anything this good. I've been wanting to go to Adamson BBQ for a few months now but because of the limited hrs that they are open the timing never worked out. Today i finally had the chance and man I'm glad i did.  I tried the two meats for lunch and got the brisket and ribs. Did i tell you about the brisket??! The ribs were also amazing. Everything just falls apart as you put your fork through it and melts in your mouth the moment it reaches your mouth. For the sides i got coleslaw and cornbread. The coleslaw was ok but nothing extraordinary and the cornbread was very nice. The location is a hip industrial looking bbq joint that only serves lunch so no alcohol and not too many options but just the perfect amount.It's the bbq joints like this that keep me from ever imagining to be a vegetarian (unfortunately). I will be dreaming about their food until next time i go again. Food: 5/5Service: 4/5Price: 4/5Overall: 5/5,4.0,5.0,131,2017-12-13,43.712476,-79.353066,Barbeque
Adamson Barbecue,"I've heard about this place from several people, including fellow Yelp Elites, and they have all raved about it. I had the pleasure of sharing a meal with Jennifer K. on our way to a photo walk around The Toronto Christmas Market.This place is spacious and rustic, nothing fancy, plain wooden counters, concrete floors, and handwritten menus on butcher paper. There is a certain charm to it though. They open at 11:00am, Tuesday to Saturday, and close when they sell out, usually by 2:00pm. I heard guests start lining up before 11:00am.Looking at their handwritten menus, meats are sold by the pound and you can get lunch plates with one, two, or three meats, and two sides. Meats include mouthwatering brisket, ribs, turkey, pulled pork, chicken, and sausages. They also have sandwiches and pies. It's a good selection, great if you're a meat lover like me!My Elite friend and I decided to share a Texas Trinity Platter (for two, $40). It included 1/2lb brisket, 1/2lb ribs, 1 sausage, 3 small sides (potato salad, coleslaw, and beans), 2 slices of bread, pickles, onions, and a slice of pie (we chose mocha). Everything was sliced and weighed to order and piled onto a metal tray covered with butcher paper. I did say this place was rustic.We were drooling with anticipation but, as true Yelp Elites and Instagrammers do, we had to take pictures first. Hurry up!I can definitely say that it was worth the wait! The meats were tender, juicy, and not oversmoked. Perfectly cooked! The dry rub had a nice flavour without being overpowering and the house BBQ sauce (optional) added the perfect amount of heat. The slice of pie was large and more than enough to share.

Adamson Barbecue,"If you are in the GTA for lunch only one day, I would recommend this place as the #1 places to go. I literally went here every weekend I was doing business in Toronto (4 weekends in a row LOL). I'm from California and have also been to Austin for Texas BBQ and this place is legit. Have not been to Franklin's in Austin, but if I don't have to wait in line for 5 hrs, this is good enough for me. Silly Canada having good American BBQ.Every Saturday I would come here 30 mins before opening and the line was a solid 30-60 people long. I'd have to wait a total of 45 mins before I could get delicious bbq. They're only open 11am-2pm, but they can run out after 1230 I assume (I don't take the risk). They smoke their meat all night. Tons of work. Super friendly people.My typical order (to feed me for the week).1lb Beef Brisket: 15/10 ask for fatty pieces, This should be the #1 thing you get if you're trying Texas BBQ; They have a really good smoke ring and they leave the ""burnt ends"" on there.1lb Beef Rib (1 bone): 15/10. Expensive, but so fatty and yummy.0.5lb Pork Ribs (2 bones): 6/10. The pork ribs are alright, but Texas is known for beef so I give them a pass.1 Jalapeno and Cheese Sausage: 5/5 Yummy and not spicy (which I like) Corn bread: 5/5 YummyCole slaw: 4/5 Fine; just cabbage reallyThey also give you pickles and onions and bread just like in Texas to eat with your meat.I would also like to add that eating it as leftovers tastes just as good as fresh!Lots of table space.Theyre kinda in the middle of an industrial area and the only reason youre there is you found it on Yelp or word of mouth. Hard to find randomly. Parking is along the street. Please don't park illegally.When I go back to Toronto, I will be sure to visit this place again.Best Texas BBQ and best BBQ period.",4.0,5.0,131,2017-12-04,43.712476,-79.353066,Barbeque
Adamson Barbecue,"Great for a weekend outing with friends or family.Despite being in the middle of no where, Adamson manages to have a line up an hour before it even opens... that's when you know you're about to have some bomb brisket. Make sure you come early! Also because there is limited free parking outside the restaurant.We got the Trinity Plate - serves 2 which has brisket, ribs, sausage and sides. The brisket just melts in your mouth. The sausage was great as well. The ribs probably comes third - it's not the saucy kind of rib that some might prefer but I personally still liked it. I only had a few bites of the sides in order to prioritize the actual BBQ. The beans were well, just beans. The coleslaw and the potato salad were decent, but these sides are definitely not the focal point here.They have great pies as well, for that something sweet after all that savoury savoury meat.There is plenty of seating for you to enjoy the food. Staff were also super friendly.

The sides are not amazing, I would just want to eat more MEAT! Love the dry rub on the ribs! So tender and the meat just fell off the bone. The beef brisket too was smokey and tender.If you want to skip the crazy line, especially for Saturday, pre order a $100 platter for pick up 4 days in advance.

I strongly recommend coming here early (early meaning before they open) to avoid waiting + get parking. My hubby and I ordered the texas trinity. So much food! And you don't get containers to take leftovers home (you can wrap your meat with paper tough) fyi. Meat was super good, tasty, and tender. Our fav was ribs.

Adamson Barbecue,"This is the first time I've been here since he opened the pizza restaurant next door and moved the bbq restaurant to the opposite side of the original.  The food and service is still excellent !!If you're looking for a five star high end posh restaurant go elsewhere.  Adam has his place set up just like the real bbq joints in central Texas.  You order from the meat counter, get your food on a tray lined in butcher's paper and go sit down in the no frills dining area. I went with my niece and we got the Texas Trinity platter for two. On paper it doesn't sound like much but believe me it's more than enough food for two people.  We even had to wrap some food to go.  For anyone that has never been here I would highly recommend ordering this platter. It gives a sample of the must try meats at any ""real"" bbq joint; brisket, ribs and sausage.   The beans are a must try also.",4.0,5.0,131,2017-11-24,43.712476,-79.353066,Barbeque
Adamson Barbecue,"I went here on a weekday 10 mins before opening( Opening time 11AM) there was a lineup that consist of 10-15 people. Like many people say; this place sells out around 1-2pm. Very limited parking but you can park on the side street. The line moved very quickly. You pick what you want, pay and find a table to sit down. Fast and friendly service. My bf and I had decided to share the Texas platter which consist of all three small sides (beans, coleslaw, potato salad) 2 slice of ribs, 2-3 slice of brisket, 2 white bread, choice of sausage and dessert of the day (key lime pie/2 cookie n cream cookies) for $40It's was very filing for 2 people to share. The brisket was the best! It had such good rub seasoning and it was extremely juicy and melts in your mouth. The ribs were also very tasty! Next time I visit this place I would def try their sandwiches. You can also get there frozen sausages/ribs/brisket to take home as well.",4.0,5.0,131,2017-07-15,43.712476,-79.353066,Barbeque
Adamson Barbecue,"Saw this place a few weeks ago on yelp and was contemplating whether to actually make a trip here for lunch due to the limited hours and the prospects of waiting in a huge line.Finally decided to experience this place and went half an hour before the place opened. Still had 20 people waiting in front of me. 15 minutes later, there's another 20 people behind me, and a few minutes before the store opened, the doors opened and we went in, lines going out the door.Due to limited seating (relative to the number of people waiting in line), we're told that you're not allowed to hold seats while someone else is waiting to order, which makes a lot of sense. They don't say it regularly though, so people that come in later don't know about this and end up holding tables down anyways. If you do this, you may be asked by a customer to move because you have no food in front of you. Don't get offended.There's a roll of butcher paper that you can use if you want to take it to go.Each customer is served one at a time, and may take a few minutes because each meat must be cut and/or weighed, and burgers/sandwiches are put together on the spot. I ended up waiting about 10 minutes, which isn't too bad, but I can imagine people towards the back of the line probably waited 30 to 45.We ordered the everything platter, and for customization we chose to have one of each of the four sausage flavours, leaner brisket, and a slice of pie. For $100, this wasn't a bad way to try most of what they have to offer. Split between 4 or 5 people and everyone gets to try a decent portion.I enjoyed the ribs and briskets the most, but the turkey and pulled pork were just ok. Sausages were flavourful, but also quite salty to me. The sides were refreshing given that everything else was greasy meat, especially the potato salad. The beans and coleslaw were ok. The sliced bread was pretty nice and wasn't just plain white bread.The pie I have to say was one of the better items there. Definitely something to try if it's still available.If I were to drop by again, I would go with their lunch plates and go with ribs and brisket.",4.0,4.0,131,2017-04-24,43.712476,-79.353066,Barbeque
Adamson Barbecue,"Have came to this place for a few times now and tried every meats they have on menu. I would say most of them are very good even thou it's not cheap but really I think it worths it. I always come here for brisket as they always make it so juicy and tender and tasty. Tried the beef ribs and it's so good but it is so expensive that 1 bone is like around $28. Right now they are expending to have pizza on the other side of their unit but they can do pick up for now until they are done setting it up.

Adamson Barbecue,"Came here at 11:10am on Tuesday just shortly after they opened. I heard there was a line up before I came here, so I was prepared for it. Then of course, there was a (short line) but while I was in line.... at 11:22am they yelled out ""pulled pork sold out"". I was prepped ahead, so I wasn't surprised... was a bit disappointed I couldn't try it tho.. but there's always a next time!We wanted to order 3 meat lunch plate just to have a taste of all the meats they offer. However during time when we place an order, we were recommended a trinity tray to share among 2 people. So we ordered a trinity + 1 extra sausage (to try the other kind they got) plus we ordered 1/2lb of turkey since it doesn't come with turkey. After seeing how 1/2 lb of brisket was only 2 slices.. we ordered 1lb of brisket on the side (approx 4 slices) to eat/to go. {total was $92}I love the brisket so so so so so much. Soft, tender, juicy. Though it has a bit of fat on it (that's what made it flavorful and juicy)... I ended up cutting the fat out cause it was a bit too greasy after a few bites for me. Turkey: surprisingly juicy and tender. Would order again. Ribs: Not favor to my tasting. It was Texas smoked style and taste was good but the meat has the chewy texture. I like my ribs to be falling off the bone kind.Sausages: I didn't like either one of them (bradwurst and jalapeno). The sausage was too hard/dry and too salty. Sides: we had potato salad, coleslaw, pinto beans and they all unique of their own. Pinto beans is fulled of smokeyness flavor, excellent paring with the slice of bread they provide. Coleslaw was fresh and not over dressed. Potato salad was mild, but filling. Dessert of the day: Coconut cream pie! (one of my fav dessert of all times... so maybe I am bias) It wasn't too sweet, has a strong coconut taste but not heavy. The whip cream wasn't freshly whipped but the pie itself was a good ending to a meal. (however I had the pie in between my meats lol)The meat was really heavy..and greasy. That 2 slice (1/2 lb) of brisket from the trinity tray ... we (2 people) couldn't even finish since we had sides and pie. Everything adds up. No wonder when I ordered, the man who cuts the meant said ""1/2 lb of meat goes a long way!"" so trueVery convenience that they have butcher paper for you to self sever and wrap your food to go.Environment: self serve. Open kitchen with raw meat cutting and being process (I don't mind it and find it entertaining). They have open space as well as outdoor for seats. Good for groups.*There's a vinegar/ bbq sauce beside the cashier...free. Be sure to give it a try especially when the meat is so heavy..and kinna greasy, and you're like..done* *To reheat left over meat or to go meat: warm in oven at low heat, wrapped*",4.0,5.0,131,2017-09-17,43.712476,-79.353066,Barbeque
Adamson Barbecue,"Randomly came here in a Saturday around 12:30 after hearing rave reviews from a close friend of mine. Had trouble deciding between the lunch special and the types of meat so I compromised and got the Texas trinity (0.5lb of brisket, 0.5lb of ribs, a sausage a side of coleslaw, potato salad, and pinto beans, and 2 cookies) and a pulled pork sandwich on top. Shared the meal with two other people. Visually, the meal was excellent. Now I'm sure some people here are thrown off by the plain white bread but it is Texas BBQ and so it is tradition. Now, speaking of the meats...I personally thought it was decent. Nothing stellar in terms of flavour and complexity. The two other people did not enjoy it though, it was not as flavourful or delicious but they're used to bold BBQ flavours. The brisket was tender with a little give but the flavour of the bark did not come through. Sausage wasn't anything to write home about though as it did not much of a distinct flavour. The ribs were the best out of the three meats of the Texas trinity. I could taste the seasoning on it and it did not need any extras. The pulled pork by itself was tender and soft but the flavour wasn't there. I like a more saucy pulled pork so I doused it.The sides were in the same shape. Potato salad was just potato, coleslaw was a bit vinegary (but it IS Texas BBQ) but the pinto beans was flavourful and delicious. The cookies were bomb though. Overall, it is definitely a place people should try. It was a shame that it doesn't really suit my needs for BBQ. I had no problems with the service and everyone was super friendly. 3 stars because according to Yelp, that is A-OK!",4.0,3.0,131,2017-06-12,43.712476,-79.353066,Barbeque

When we saw the place from outside we were hesitant to continue but glad we didn't backed out.  The place inside is a garage place turned into an eating place. Nothing fancy but I got a relax feeling. They serve everything on a tray with just a sheet of liner on it.We were lucky as they are down to the last brisket for the day.

If you are smart, you would do the same :)I dare you to find a place in Toronto that does a better beef brisket than here. MOIST, JUICY, FATTY melt-in-your-mouth heaven.  enough said.The dry rub are FANtastic.  I would say they are comparable to the ribs at Barque BBQ (which I personally think have the best ribs in Toronto).

The chicken in the most underrated thing...it's seriously delicious. It's sooo moist ( yes, I hate that word too) it's so flavourful and the way the guy takes the breastbone out in one slice is a serious work of art. My boyfriend and I have gone about 5 or 6 times and each time has been amazing. We don't even talk to each other, we just sit there quietly eating because it's sooo good. We just tried the jalapeño sausage the other day and MY GOD was it good too..Seriously, everything's good. If you haven't gone yet you need to seriously get your meat loving ass down there and try it.

Tinuno,"I read some of the reviews on here. Some people are weird, rating a $15/person place like it's a 4 star restaurant or something. Rate accordingly to the price bracket people, you're here for food, not ambience or service. Another few that were off to me, ""the fish was charred"". Um, no, it isn't, the skin is, but you peel that off. Lol a few of them were like, ""Well, we reserved for 10 people, one cancelled, and we were still charged for the extra person"". Lol, kids, split the $15 between the other 9 people. Iunno, different strokes I guess. But for $15, in 2018, with no price increase despite 20% increase in minimum wage, this place deserves all 5 stars and then some. All of the food was delicious, delivered hot, with excellent garlic fried rice. You should definitely check this place out before they close, because if they don't raise prices, with the amount of good they give, they can't stay open for long.",4.0,5.0,225,2018-01-28,43.671113,-79.37485,Filipino

Tinuno,"After seeing many pictures on Instagram of people eating food with their hands, I really wanted to check out Tinuno! I recently came here for lunch with 3 of my friends. My friend made reservations beforehand. Upon arrival, the outside of restaurant was not too appealing and inviting but that did not shun me away. Once inside the restaurant (which was not crowded at all) we were greeted by a girl and taken over to our table. The tables and chair seemed like they were donated to the restaurant because there were many mismatched chairs. The girl wiped our table and then brought over the banana leaves. She unravelled the leaves and covered the entire table with it. Then she wiped the leaves. Another woman came, but this time with food! We started off with a fruit and veggie salad along with 2 slices of blood orange. The salad consisted of shredded mango and carrots. Interesting mix. And then, the garlic rice came. The smell of it was just amazing - personally I am not a fan of garlic -but they roasted tiny pieces of garlic and mixed it with the jasmine white rice. They placed the rice in the middle of the table and spread it out into a log shape. Over the rice, the woman placed the grilled seafood, vegetable and meat - there was an assortment of seafood: shrimps, mussels, squid, calamari, two types of fish: tilapia and milk fish, pieces of pork belly, chicken skewers bbq'ed with a slightly sweet sauce, eggplant, okra. I liked the spread, and how they divided the food proportioned to the number of people at the table. Pretty much, we each got two of the mussels, one skewer, and 2 pieces of okra. The rest we had to divide ourselves.The tilapia tasted a little funny and both of our milkfish were a tad bit too salty but edible. My friend decided to order turon for us, which is a sweet dessert spring roll - inside was plantain. The spring roll was coated with a syrup on the outside. This was delicious!! Overall, the experience was fun! But feel like it is one of those try one-time and never again type of experience.",4.0,4.0,225,2018-01-10,43.671113,-79.37485,Filipino
Tinuno,"Pains me to write this review because I really wanted to love this place. Service is average, food is disappointing. Probably a one time experience and I would never willingly come back.Came on Christmas Eve with a group of 7 people, but one person was unable to make it due to the snow.It also took over 11 phone calls to make a reservation which is pretty ridiculous in my opinion.When we told the host that our eighth guest would be unable to make it anymore, he basically said, oh well that's too bad you'll have to pay for his food since I've already sent the order to the kitchen. I was pretty displeased with this since they took the order prior to when everyone was gathered at the place. While I understand, I would have thought that they would hold off on making our order since half the party was there.The ambience was very lacklustre as well. I'm not expecting much, but it felt a little unsettling to be seated in the upstairs area. The best way I can describe it is ""dingy"" comes to mind.Food-wise, honestly, it was again underwhelming. I was REALLY looking forward to the food here, but everything arrived COLD. Literally nothing on our table was warm which is a huge disappointment since it should've been hot off the grill.The flavours were pretty okay, but I just couldn't get over the fact that one of the fish meant for 4 people was pretty much inedible. All I could taste was the charcoal and how burnt it was. There was one fish that could've been amazing ... if it was served even remotely heated. Everything else was pretty average and nothing noteworthy worth mentioning. Maybe the chicken skewer, but again, it was cold.Don't expect anything to blow your mind with how good it is because you'll just set yourself up for disappointment.I will not be recommending this place to my friends.

Tinuno,"I was really looking forward to eating here, based on all the great reviews and of course, the photos depicting the amazing feasts eaten here every day. I've had one other Kamayan feast experience in Toronto and it was more than double the price of Tinuno. However, if given a choice, I'd sooner throw down the extra cash at Lamesa than eat at Tinuno again. I found that the food here all tasted the same, as everything was cooked in the same manner. It looks good, and the portions are certainly quite generous for the price, but there was really nothing special about the meal. The ambiance is certainly not great (we dined upstairs) and it felt like we were eating in an office as opposed to a restaurant. It was cramped and uncomfortable. I guess they just try to get as many people in and out as they can, in order to generate any kind of profit. I don't know how else they can make money when they're only charging $15 per person. I'm sure the food quality is not very high, otherwise they'd be losing money hand over fist. Still, it was an interesting experience.

All the sauces are self serve at a station. I liked how they already have bottles of water on the table ready for your party. Due to the hectic-ness of the restaurant, staffs do tend to forget things here and there. For example, we almost missed out on our reservation because they weren't organized. Also, not that it affected us but there were extra skewers being served around as they didn't know which table it was actually for.

The food was laid out on top of a bed of rice and included an array of seafood, okra, skewers and a mango salad on the side.I thought the food was mediocre as a whole. There were definitely some dishes I enjoyed a lot more than others. One of the fish dishes tasted great while the other just tasted like char. I loved the skewers but they had enough for one per person. Overall I don't believe the food justified the $15 price tag per person.My group consisted of 7 people and the person in charge of calling in had a difficult time connecting to the resturant because their line was always busy. Our reservation was originally for 8 people but we had a last minute cancellation that we told them about at the door.

My favourite was the pork belly and many people loved the garlic rice.The main downside was despite having a reservation I had to wait for about half hour for the room to clear up. However they did try their best to make up for it by giving extra rice, free ube ice cream (very yummy) and allowing us to stay in the room until closing, which gave us about 2 hours + They also did place the food order while we were waiting so the food arrived quickly once we were seated.",4.0,4.0,225,2017-11-06,43.671113,-79.37485,Filipino

If you're a germaphobe or don't like sharing, this also isn't for you. I really didn't mind the experience. It was fun, but the food was horrible. My reviews are generally reviewed based on the food. And yes it's $15, but everything tastes terrible except the skewer. Also, if u go with a big group, you get a lot less than when u go with just two people.

We received 2 calamari, 3 milk fish, 3 tilapia and each person received 2 mussels, 2 shrimps, 2 okra, a pork skewer and some chunks of pork meat and mango salad. I didn't even touch the tilapia because...well it's tilapia. The milk fish was so fishy I took one bite and didn't want anymore. The mussels weren't fresh, the calamari, shrimp and pork were all dry and the mango salad was bland. The only thing that tasted decent was the skewer because it was covered in sauce and I guess the rice, but how can you go wrong with rice?The two stars are for the skewer and the service was pretty decent.

Tinuno,"Love this place! Been here twice. Once on a Sunday afternoon for lunch around 1pm and it was very busy. It took a while for the servers to notice us and took about 30-40 minutes to get a table for 3 without a reservation. The second time was a Tuesday night for dinner with a reservation for 12 people and we were able to get the whole front patio to ourselves. For $15 you get the Kamayan Feast with 2 fish (1 whole grilled with bones and the other was a fillet), grilled calamari, pork belly, a chicken skewer for each person, shrimp, mussels, eggplant and okra. With mango salad, slice of orange and a bottle of water. And their garlic fried rice is delicious, warm, lots of garlic flavour and refillable. The banana leaf on the table was also beautiful and smelled fragrant. They also have a spicy vinegar to dip. For $15 its a great deal for the amount of variety of food!It is extremely worth it coming with 2 because you will get the same amount as you would for 4 people, but even with 3 people we were really really full after. The restaurant itself isnt the prettiest and the surrounding area is also not the nicest, the tables and chairs are very basic and the staff also seems to be in a flurry. The service isn't bad with the younger servers being more friendly. But its super fun eating with your hands (they provide gloves on the table if you want) Would definitely keep coming back, but its not an all the time everyday kind of meal. I'd also suggest going with people you are comfortable sharing with because of the family style and the fact you will be licking your fingers and putting hands back into the pile",4.0,5.0,225,2017-09-21,43.671113,-79.37485,Filipino
Tinuno,"Tinuno is a family style, hole-in-the-wall Filipino restaurant. The place is PACKED with individuals across the city to sample this unique Filipino fare on banana leaf. The Kamayan Feast ($15.00 per person) is a bargain. I dragged my brother all the way from Scarborough to experience this seafood feast.  The Kamayan Feast included grilled bangus (milk fish), grilled tilapia, grilled calamari, grilled pork belly, BBQ pork shoulder skewers, shrimps, mussels, grilled okra, grilled eggplants, garlic rice, mango salad, slices of orangeThe two Filipino veteran patrons next to us said they would starve themselves the whole day before visiting Tinuno. They attested to Tinuno's quality and authenticity.  According to them, there are only two places in Toronto that serves Kamayan Feast and Tinuno is superior in every way. They were eating with their hands like pros! We've also learned from our Filipino sensei (they've earned their teacher status now) that garlic rice is unlimited! Heaven rejoice! Juices from freshly grilled seafood merged with the garlicky, savory rice. It was the highlight of the meal. Unfortunately, other parts of our meal fell short - calamari was luke warm, tilapia was not fresh, pork skewers were dried, shrimps were overcooked. Tinuno has a lot of potential to deliver an out of the world experience, instead, it missed the mark. Overall, our meal was plentiful. We were satisfied with out meal.

We made reservation ahead of time and they able to accommodate for our group.What a fun experience! There isn't anything particularly amazing about the food. Quite simple but it was well presented and created a fun, more engaging experience to share with friends or family. Give it a try, put on some gloves, eat with your hands, get messy and enjoy!

Tinuno,"UPDATE: Increased my rating from 3 to 4 stars because upon my comments, management promised to discuss these issues with staff and also to move reservations to an online system. I hope they carry out on their promise!If I were to rate this place based on the value and quality of food, I'd give it a whopping give stars. However, the customer service and food service requires significant attention.I made a reservation to celebrate my parents' 25th anniversary two weeks in advance. The guy taking my reservation on the phone evidently had hearing problems. He couldn't hear my name, even when I spelt it out to him, and wouldn't ever let me finish my sentences. I doubt that the restaurant was that loud at 10am in the morning.When we arrived, we realized that there was therefore an issue with my reservation. The time, meant for 6:30pm, was written as 4pm. My name was also misspelt. We were fortunate that there were still empty seats, and so were seated soon.The server had warned us that there'd be a 15 minute wait for the food. It took us nearly 40 minutes of waiting. We literally saw groups of people come in AFTER us and eat way BEFORE us. That is never how business works, particularly in restaurants that are first-come, first serve. By this point, my parents are irritated, and their dinner largely spoilt.It wasn't until I made a point and rushed them that they began to make our order. Unbelievable. Even worse, they forget our squid. Again, after 5 minutes of waiting, I have to rush them and then the squid arrives. By then, some of the order had already gotten cold.Granted, Tinuno is a busy restaurant. But this is NOT how you treat customers. No apologies, nothing.The food itself, however, is delicious. I admit that grudgingly. We were blown away by the presentation (albeit incomplete) as well as the taste. Both fish were perfectly grilled and marinated, to the point that the fish cheek was bursting with flavour.I might come again, but if they mess up my reservation again, that's it.",4.0,4.0,225,2017-10-02,43.671113,-79.37485,Filipino
Tinuno,This place is amazing!  In my opinion its the best deal in the city for a kamayan feast.  You definitely leave full and wanting to come back!!!  There are tons of pictures on help and you get exactly what is shown on the pictures.  Bring cash just incase their machines do not work.  It will avoid you walking to a cash machine at a convenient store.  $15 + HST.  Great deal!,4.0,5.0,225,2017-12-03,43.671113,-79.37485,Filipino
Mega Street Food Complex,"Perfect 5/5. Seeing a store with 5 tiny speciality stores combined (sushi burrito/poke/salad, noodle soups/dim sum, bubble tea, Fried chicken, and japanese crepe) run by a 2 person crew had me drop my jaw. We ordered the chicken nugget bento box and the salmon burrito. The Chicken nugget bento came first and it comes with a respectable portion of fried chicken that tasted very juicy and tender on the inside. The outside was covered with a satisfying crunch in every bite. I would definitely order again. I really liked the attention to detail and how there was some seaweed seasoning on top of the rice and some vegetables and sliced mangos. This dish tasted really good with the hot sauce on the side when I asked. The server was very kind to offer this for me.The sushi burrito came a bit later but it was top notch as well. Great combination and portions when I shared it with my partner. We liked that there were corn and crabmeat but part of me wished there were some avocados too. But overall it was nicely wrapped and tasted great. I dont think there is another joint in this neighbourhood right now that offers sushi burritos! (correct me if I am wrong)Anyways we will definately be coming back and I hope this place doesnt get too popular as I know (as per the review below) that blogTO will definitely pick up on this and the lines here will get crazy.

Mega Street Food Complex,"This is an interesting place as it range from fried chicken to wonton noodle to poke bowls. But after observing it is owned by the same owner. I've ordered the shrimp rice roll. The rice roll was a bit too moist. But the shrimp was large. Moving on to the wonton noodle, I've asked  them to mix the dumpling and wonton. Both tasted good and a good size. I didn't like the noodle as I find it too soft. But it is convenient, I will come back to try other items on the menu. I came back again on a weeknight and ordered the wonton again and fried chicken. I find the wonton didn't taste as good as my first visit and the fried chicken the batter didn't taste dry enough. I will see come back as it is convenient but hopefully the wonton flavour improves.",4.0,3.0,11,2018-01-28,43.78062,-79.415513,"Creperies , Japanese , Chinese"
Mega Street Food Complex,"This looks like a pretty brand new place, the place looks spic and span but the service is too slow. The workers, albeit very nice, moved at a snail speed and each food came out one at a time. For a Hong Kong style cafeteria place, that is unacceptable. But I will give this place a few months and hopefully the service will pick up. I hope it does well, it's a good concept and will compete with neighbouring restaurants if the service is faster and they continue churning out good food. There were like 4 different ""restaurants"" but in the same store/area: crepes, sushi burrito & poke, bubble tea, Taiwanese fried chicken and wonton soup & lo mein. There should have been more seating especially with people waiting so long for their order. There were 8-9 tables. The food wasn't bad. We had the Kimchi XL fried chicken (9.99) and shrimp wonton soup (6.99). The prices are fair. The fried chicken was cooked decent (somewhat moist) but under seasoned. The crust was Taiwanese style and was crunchy. Didn't really get any kimchi flavour. They cooked to order so that's good. The shrimp wonton soup was decent. My husband is Chinese and I am not so I thought it was flavourful but he said it was standard, not that special. For the price, it's pretty good. Come with 4 big wontons, shrimp was cooked well and flavourful. The soup was good, standard broth and okay seasoned. I thought the noodles were fine but my husband said it wasn't that good and they were stuck together. That's kind of noodle soup 101, you gotta stir the noodles around! The old man that made it was super nice and sweet though. I also had the hazelnut milk tea (4.99), not good. No black tea flavour. Tasted like almond milk but with hazelnut flavour and sugar. Another annoyance was it looks like each order was done one at a time so my bubble tea was made after the other dishes. This is very inefficient because there were at least 4 workers at each ""restaurant"" station but each order was made one at a time? They'll need to speed up or every customer would probably not come back. Another note: I thought the workers, clearly new at the restaurant biz handled this one disgruntled customer well. I have no idea what was wrong but she had complaints and the employees were trying very hard to please her. Her english was terrible but she kept getting mad at the workers (whose english was bad too) for not understanding her. It looks like she ordered one dish and milk tea. Unless there was a hair in it or it was inedible, my goodness lady, just eat it or throw it out, why make such a fuss? It's such cheap food! She was also asking for an elastic band? I've never seen this at any other restaurant lol. I'd come back because I like the concept, convenience and the food was decent.

However, I waited 45 mins for my order and it wasn't what i ordered.  Owner tried to compensate with a free pop...(which was free for any customers anyways). Poorly organized process and staff were incompetent to understand that orders should be done on a first come first serve basis. After 45 mins, I decided to ask for a refund and was offered the wrong order to compensate...  I didn't have time to argue for $6 back so just took it and left. I do like the variety of options but can't wait 45 mins for an order.

We tried the fried chicken Bento and the shrimp wonton soup without noodles. Both were very good!The Fried chicken was prepared Taiwanese style and was very crispy on the outside. The rice in the Bento box was sushi rice and was equally addicting. The shrimp wonton soup had 5 jumbo wontons inside.

This is exactly the kind of place that gets featured on BlogTO to feed the zombie foodie hordes - casual ambience, great selection of a variety of food, good value for pretty good food. But I will stop being selfish. Here's the review:This complex is actually a 5-in-1 food court - Sushi Burrito/Poke Bowl, Chinese wonton noodle stand, Taiwanese fried chicken (think Hot Star), Japanese Crepe, and Bubble tea. We had a couple sushi burritos, the spicy salmon ($11.99) and the grilled mango chicken ($8.99). I was really impressed by the chicken one - it was seasoned like a Taiwanese fried chicken. The salmon was average but I still liked it. For value, go with the chicken options. There is seating for approximately 32 people (8 tables of 4) and they play some Kpop music on the tv, nice background and not overpowering. The service was very good. They have a couple intro specials - come before Jan 31st and get a free pop with your order. Like on Facebook for a free small fries. So like I said earlier, get here while it's still pretty calm.

Mega Street Food Complex,"There are so many Asian eateries in this neighbourhood that it's hard to decide which one to enter but am I ever glad we looked on Yelp, read the great reviews and walked into this place. It looks a bit like a Baskin Robbins ice cream parlour and the ambience is definitely fast food, but it works for what they serve. It's brand new, less than one month old, and run by a very helpful and friendly staff who make everything to order so it's hot and fresh. We ordered the chicken nugget bento and chicken nugget poutine. I was worried the nuggets would be reconstituted ground up chicken but they were actually whole chunks of fresh chicken and the crispy outside was perfectly done. The bento box was a very sizeable portion (and comes with a free pop!), and the fries and real cheese curds on the poutine were great. There was also some sort of topping drizzled on top of the poutine, sort of like sesame seeds, which was a nice touch. Only wish the poutine gravy was a bit saltier (it was an Asian gravy that had a bit of sweetness to it), and that the cheese curds melted into the poutine which they somehow didn't even though the fries and gravy were nice and hot, but all in all we were very happy with our meals and will come back to try the sushi burrito/poke bowl, noodle soup and rice rolls.

Sansotei Ramen,"Sansotei is my favourite place in Toronto for ramen, bar none. Although the lineups can be long, the wait is worth it. My go-to is the spicy tan tan which hits the spot in terms of heat and flavour. I usually get it with thin noodles as I find it makes it easier to eat.Be prepared to share your table with other diners, this restaurant is very small so communal dining is a thing. They do tend to turn the tables quite fast, however, so musical chairs is unfortunately a necessity during busy times.Other popular items on the menu include the tonkotsu ramen and zangi (chicken karaage) which are both amazing in their own right. Personally, I like things spicy so have not ventured past the tan tan.If you like ramen, go here immediately.

Once inside, we were super cozy and the restaurant smelled incredible.We ordered goyza, bae got the miso black ramen and I selected the tomato ramen for my main.My fiance decided not to tell me he knew the tomato ramen comes with a giant prawn, head intact. He thought this was really hilarious. I know this is not a big deal for most people but just personal preference, I don't enjoy my meal staring back at my from the bowl. Oh wells!!Our ramen arrived hot and steaming. Super flavourful and the noodles were delicious. I dug my shrimp friend out of my bowl and he was our dining companion for the evening. I did eventually end up eating the tail, which was tasty.Personally, I would not rush back but only because I prefer a veggie option for my ramen (some peeps may roll their eyes but I try to avoid meat when I can lol).All of that having been said - Overall, we enjoyed and would recommend to ramen lovers!",4.0,4.0,719,2018-01-04,43.655004,-79.386473,"Ramen , Noodles"
Sansotei Ramen,"This is my favourite ramen place hands down. A friend suggested Sansotei long ago and my fiancé and I have been coming here for years. There is usually a small lineup here around dinner time but the wait is reasonable for small parties. My go-to is the spicy tan tan ramen. I've tried plenty of ramen but this remains my favourite. It is a spicy sesame flavour ramen with chashu pork, ground pork, soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots and shredded chillies. This ramen is packed with flavour and you have the option for thin or thick noodles, I suggest going with thick. They only serve a limited amount daily, I learned that the hard way on one visit, although you can't go wrong with their other choices such as the Tonkotsu Black. We also usually pick a side to accompany our ramen and our favourite is the Zangi, which is their take on Chicken Karaage. Nice, large pieces of juicy, deep fried chicken that go well with any ramen. The service is good and friendly. The orders usually come out very quickly and the water is constantly refilled. Every time we are downtown and craving ramen, this is the place we visit.

I love their noodles - it's nicely cooked, the texture is not too chewy, nice spring to it and not overcooked. the meat is seasoned well, and their egg is always perfectly soft boiled. I liked the sides that comes with the ramen, and their broth - well packed with flavour, but when you drink it you don't feel that it's excessively salty (it is hidden in there though! but the flavour is balanced out).Def. worth checking out this chain if you haven't tried yet.",4.0,4.0,719,2017-11-15,43.655004,-79.386473,"Ramen , Noodles"

But yes, for someone that does not usually eat anything fatty, means I have to close my eyes and chew quickly. But it is well worth it. My wife had the spicy tan tan and really enjoyed hers as well. I tried a little and it had a spicy garlic infused flavour that warmed me up even with the little bit that I had.

We initially were going to go to Sansotei and split a ramen and then head to Ramen Isshin afterwards to spread our meal into two and lengthen our day but it was 1:00pm and we waited a good ~15 minutes outside in 10 degree weather so it was decided that we would skip isshin for another time (Note, you will be waiting outside if there is a line, and by the time we finished eating, it was twice as long as when we first got there). We each got our own individual bowls, hers being the a traditional tonkotsu (~$12 CAD) with thin noodle and mine being the more adventurous miso black (~$14 CAD). The bowl came out and I took a bite out of the mushroom and I knew from that single bite that this was going to be an awesome bowl of ramen. The black garlic was stronger and more distinct that many bowls I've had in California. I continued eating and was not disappointed, nor was my girlfriend with her bowl of tonkotsu. Having had my fair share of ramen throughout California, I can say this is on on-par with the best of them including Santouka and the likes. Everything, besides the meat, was spot on. The pork was a little less fatty than anticipated and lacked the texture that I yearn for when I eat ramen but the broth itself was on point.All in all, would wait again outside for 15 minutes in 10 degree weather.

Very simple menu but has all you need! Ordered deep fried chicken, gyoza (dumpling), Spicy Tan tan Ramen and tonkatsu black (garlic).You get a choice of thin or thick noodles.

The pork (Cha Siu) was thick but did not have much flavour (my heart broke, almost perfect). That being said I enjoy the Tonkatsu Black over the Spicy Tan Tan.

Sansotei Ramen,"We're pretty spoiled here in the Bay Area with delicious ramen. I had high hopes for this place given the high reviews. However, we were a little underwhelmed by the taste. I must admit the noodles and the broth seemed of great quality, but it wasn't tasty nor delicious enough to justify a recommendation or a second visit back to this place. There was a 5 minute wait when we arrived on a Saturday at noon for lunch. We were surprised there was no wait, but of course a line started forming shortly after we were seated. We had the bar seats near the window, which we didn't mind. Despite having people watching me eat from outside, it was not a bother. The service was quick and the menu was easy to read. The restaurant is pretty tiny and slim so it was hard to walk without bumping into people's chairs. We had to get the black ramen, the bf got the black tonkotsu ramen and I had the black miso ramen, both opted for thin noodles. We got our foods in less than 10 minutes. The broth was honestly something I could not remember. The taste was a bit odd and I was sad I couldn't make it spicy. They provided the basic spice powder which is more for flavoring than taste. The thin noodles were too thin, I think we should've gotten thick noodles instead. The bf's black tonkotsu ramen tasted weird, he thought mines tasted better. The portion was decent and there were enough pork slices. I was quite full towards the end. The broth wasn't delicious enough for us to finish. On the bright side, my ramen dish came with a flower and the presentation looked great. Total came out to a little less than $30 CAN. I must admit, the mushrooms in my ramen were great.

Sansotei Ramen,Sansotei is my favorite ramen place in Toronto. Some may argue that they like the noodles more at other places. But I think Sansotei makes the most flavorful tonkotsu broth and broth is crucial in a bowl of ramen. I have always liked Sansotei for their ramen. My favorite is the tonkotsu black. The tonkotsu black is stronger than the regular tonkotsu with the extra garlic oil. The broth isn't thick but it is so flavorful. Spicy tantan is also good for those spicy lovers. I like both types of noodles. The thick is more chewy while the thin absorbs more of the broth flavor. I like to switch it up from time to time. The service here is good.

Sansotei Ramen,"Excellent ramen place. The ""black"" ramen varieties are the unique offerings here, so I'd recommend trying those. The other types are commonly found at any other ramen joint, and I'm not convinced that they would make them significantly better than any of the other A-level ramen places. Every now and then, you might find yourself waiting in line with a few Japanese people even, which always inspires confidence knowing that it's ""up to par"" with their own expectations.The lineup is long and you will be stuck waiting outside. n the winter especially, it's by no means a comfortable experience. Even when seated, you are cramped and potentially sharing a table with a stranger, and every time the door is opened you are greeted by a cold gust. It's also a shame that their menu is really small, would have appreciated a few more sides or other things to munch on (I think out of all the ramen places I've been to, Sansotei might have the smallest menu).",4.0,4.0,719,2017-12-16,43.655004,-79.386473,"Ramen , Noodles"
Sansotei Ramen,"I pass by this place a lot on my lunch breaks at work and there's always a line up. I went to try it out on a Saturday for late lunch and again there was a small line-up. We waited outside for about 10 mins and were seated quickly in a long table with others. I had the black miso and my friend had the spicy tantan with thick noodles.

Sansotei Ramen,"Best ramen on the block. Sansotei never skimps on the quality of their broth - every slurp is rich, creamy, tasty. The noodles are usually well cooked.My personal recommendations are the most expensive ramens: the Tonkotsu Black and the Miso Black. Mmmmm. You will not regret ordering. The second is even more photogenic and garnished with a flower. Chashu pork is sliced thinner than other ramen restaurants but packed with taste.The thing about this location compared to other locations I've been to is that the space is super cramped and the service slumps. Unless you're fortunate enough to score 1 of 2 booths in the back, you'll be sat at the same table as other guests with your belongings touching if you have frumpy bags or coats. Their lunch and dinner service is BUSY - meaning you'll be asked to stand outside the store in a line without a number (do not dare to leave the line) for between 5-25 minutes, which is long enough for me to say screw it and find someplace else to eat. The servers are professional but you can tell they're constantly on fast-paced mode - they welcome guests and thank them as they leave but from what I've experienced, monotony, passively, and without eye contact. They also rush to give you your bill. No need to ask, they'll hit you with ""together or separate?"" as soon as you finish and they clear your plate.

Kingyo,"My friends and I came to Kingyo to celebrate a friend's birthday. As odd as it may sound coming from someone who has yet to visit Japan, it can only be described as the most authentic izakaya experience I've had thus far. At least, authentic with respect to my romanticization, imagination, and social media-driven impression of what it should be. From the heated stones to grill the wagyu and beef tongues, the overt and unadulterated freshness of the seafood, the thought put into composition of these vibrant dishes, the tasty synergy to the sake, to the live goldfish aquarium in the middle of our table; Kingyo has been the most memorable izakaya experience up to the time of this writing.The two highlights I'd like to bring forth include the stone bowl uni don and the kaisen don. The briney and creaminess that is uni with the scallions and the vegetal crisp texture of nagaimo fit perfectly with the piping hot rice. Just sampling once from my friend's bowl prompted me to get my own to devour, despite the party having moved on to the birthday cake. The kaisen don I was barely able to restrain myself long enough to snap a shot. Beautifully put together and very fresh.Every course, plate, and bowl that arrived initiated a sort of ritual. To savour slowly to extend the bliss as much as possible, take some sips of sake which in turn lead to more anticipation for the next bite. I definitely would like to come back for the noodles, lunch specials, and other limited/special menu offerings.

Kingyo,"What an incredible find! I was in Toronto for a few days, and came to Kingyo based on a local's recommendation that it was very authentic and delicious. Staff: Super friendly. And whenever customers arrive or leave, the whole staff greets/bids farewell in Japanese.Ambiance: Really clean and cool. Jazz music playing in the background and Japanese film projecting on the back wall - an odd combination but I was digging it. Food: Just amazing - two of us shared 4 appetizers and a noodle dish and were beyond stuffed.1) First was the ""death"" chicken, which was basically deep fried chicken thigh in a diablo chili sauce. Super juicy and moist, but the sauce was a bit one-note (a bit too salty) and was probably my least favorite dish. 2) Next came Agebitashi, which is marinated eggplant in sake, mentsuyu, and crispy bonito flakes. Fresh, flavorful, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. 3) Yuzu ankake bokkake udon, which came with stewed beef tendon, soft boiled egg, sour plum, scallions, marinated kelp and tempura bits, all accompanied by a thick yuzu flavoured sauce. This was my absolute favorite! The blends of flavors and textures were spectacular. After eating the first dishes, we were so impressed and decided to order more!4) Stone bowl mushroom tofu, thick mushroom paste on deep-fried tofu. This came out sizzling and delicious. They added okra and dried scallops to the sauce which made it extra sticky and flavorful. This was really fun to dig into and eat!5) Tako wasabi, which is raw and/or cooked diced octopus marinated with wasabi stems and sea kelp, and served with nori seaweed paper. I preferred the cooked octopus over the raw, which was slightly too wet and slimy. All in all, an amazing experience. Not sure if I'll have the chance to travel back to Toronto anytime soon.

I remember the first time, I was really impressed with the freshness of the sashimi and the kingyo izakaya set (only makes 10 sets a day). Perhaps it's what we ordered this time around, but the food was underwhelming for me. We ordered the pork Kakuni and sashimi bowl with rice. The pork was a bit dry, but the sides were really good. I especially enjoyed the tofu. The sashimi was really fresh, but they added some cooked salmon in the bowl, which was a it dry. I wish they added uni in it! They have beer for $3 at lunch. I enjoyed the frozen grapes as a dessert. For $45 for lunch, I feel it wasn't worth it.

Kingyo,"Wow! The food at this place was amazing. I had the Shrimp Kimchi Marine, Stone Grilled Beef tongue, Grilled Tontoro Pork Cheek, Stone bowl Sea Urchin Don, and Burdock Kakiage and Shabu Shabu Udon. This was my first time cooking meat on a stone grill and the result was as good as I had hoped it would be! As the meat sizzles on the hot stone, cooking quite quickly, I had to seriously try not to wolf down everything and slow down and enjoy it slowly. The rest of the food we ordered were great as well, but I've got to say in the end the Sea Urchin Don surprised me the most. I'm usually not likely to order a sea urchin dish, due to past experiences of it tasting too fishy to me. On a whim I decided to share it with a friend and I was so surprised how yummy it tasted. Heat of the stone bowl and the rice cooks the sea urchin enough to mellow the fishy taste for me personally, and for me it was the perfect way to have sea urchin. In combination with the rest of the bowl, I think the sea urchin gives it almost cheesy taste overall. The server mixes the don in front of you so you  can see exactly what kinds of  goodies are in the Don. With every spoonful of the don the burst of fish roe gives the extra salty burst of  flavor that provides so much savory satisfaction. This interesting combination of flavors work so well together that I couldn't stop eating! The services was also top notch. They're always there to top up our water and take away finished dishes before we ask.

Kingyo,"It's been awhile since I came here but first time coming here for lunch on the weekend. Kingyo Assorted Deluxe Bento ($19)Gotta love this cute and delicate 9 dish bento set. Comes with unlimited miso soup and rice. Their miso soup is actually different than normal miso soup - has quite a lot of other ingredients inside like lotus and some other veggies. The 9 dishes from top row left to right, fried taro balls, japanese hamburg, tofu, japanese egg, shrimp tempura, black cod, braised pork belly, green onions, and chicken karaage. All dishes tasted really good. What stood out to me was the taro ball - the other layer was sticky chewy like mochi, but the inside filling was nice and soft. The black cod was really tender, but not the melt in your mouth kind. It doesnt look like a lot but it's actually quite filling.Beef cutlet ($19)Similar to their pork tonkatsu cutlet, but this was beef steak instead. Comes with unlimited miso soup, rice and cabbage. What caught my attention was in the menu they mentioned the steak would be served medium. Most pieces were, but there were some pieces that were more on the done side. I do have to say the portion was a lot smaller than the pork tonkatsu. The breading was nice and crispy, it didn't taste greasy at all. Food was good but quite expensive, and service was slow.

My friend and I shared the brussels sprouts, daikon radish and tempura salad, avocado/tuna tartare, salad rolls, and one of the specials, karaage chicken tacos.

Spring rolls were good, although the tacos and tartare were just okay. Overall we were happy with the dishes and the portions.  Unfortunately the service could have been better, it wasn't busy when we were there (a Wednesday night) but still seemed like we had to wave the servers down to make our order and to get the bill.

You can make reservations online, and there is usually a decent sized crowd chilling inside the restaurant ranging from classy-looking students to families. While it's tucked away in a weird part of Cabbagetown, that just makes it a cool place that always has availabilities for walk-ins! It's really pretty, and they always have some sort of Japanese movie being screened at the bar area. The drinks are delicious and aesthetically pleasing, and the menu has a wide selection to choose from. I love how fresh their sushi is and there is never a long wait for your food. The washroom downstairs has cool-looking (nonfunctional) arcade games, which they also have upstairs as decor.

Omelette yakisoba (special menu for limited time) was also great. The sauce was not too sweet or overpowering. Noodles were perfectly cooked.

We ordered the following (don't know if these are the exact names):-- Sashimi shooter-- Duck tataki -- Karaage (fried chicken)-- Omurice (omelette)-- Pork Ramen-- Cheesecake and mango sorbetMy favourite is a toss up between the ramen or the omurice, with a close runner-up of the sashimi shooter. The shooter had an interesting gooey texture that I think might put some people off, and to be honest while I enjoyed it, it wasn't exceptional. It's not something I'd say is a must-try. but the presentation was really special. The ramen and omurice were both good. The karaage was made perfectly, although I prefer Guu/Kinka's; I feel like Kingyo's isn't as crunchy-fried and has an interesting herby/spice flavour that deviates too much from the pure fried chicken taste I like. I would pass on the cheesecake and sorbet. The portion was puny and while it was good, it wasn't a satisfying portion-to-price ratio. I prefer the laid-back atmosphere to the boisterous Guu/Kinka and I feel like there are so many things on the menu to choose from that you're bound to find something.

The broth was A-OK but the beef was delicious and cooked perfectly.You do see and hear Mr. Chef in the back slapping and pulling the noodles which reinforces the idea that yes, these noodles are fresh, hand pulled, and authentic. Service was good too.I enjoyed my meal but it wasn't anything too special.",4.0,3.0,155,2017-10-25,43.65239,-79.397391,"Chinese , Noodles , Ramen"
Homemade Ramen,"This is the 1st Chinese restaurant I stopped by in Toronto . The food was delicious and service was great. Hand pulled noodles were delicious! They hand you a pad and you write down the order number you want. Remember, debit or cash only no credit cards.The menu is pretty big with many choices to choose from. In the end we ordered the sliced pork belly with garlic sauce, beef noodle soup and chicken stir fry noodles and scallion pancake. All the noodles were all hand pulled.The pork belly was soft, tender and the garlic was not overpowering and was balanced nicely with the sweet and salty. The noodle soup and stir fry were delicious and we enjoyed every chewy bite. The scallion pancakes were very light and not too oily and they were tasty good. A great hand pulled noodle restaurant that you can't go wrong with. I will be back whenever I'm in town again.",4.0,4.0,155,2017-09-14,43.65239,-79.397391,"Chinese , Noodles , Ramen"
Homemade Ramen,"Very good, fresh, chewy noodles.WAIT: Came on a Saturday night around 6pm and there was no wait.  After us, people trickled in and some had to wait but never more than 5 or so minutes.  ATMOSPHERE: The inside is pretty simple with tables located in the front area near the door and then further back.  The restaurant can seat a good amount of people and there are booths as well as tables.  We sat near the door which was a little annoying since it was freezing outside but when asked to move they said no.  The wait staff here is a little  frazzled and it's kind of hard to get a hold of them.FOOD: you order by writing what you want on the piece of paper and then handing it to them.  The menu can seem confusing so I would ask questions or look at pictures.HOUSE RAMEN - (1101) in case you didn't already realize, this is not real Japanese ramen. It's basically hand-pulled noodles that Chinese people eat (similar to Lam Zhou or Tasty hand pulled noodle in NYC).  The noodles are thin and very chewy, springy and fresh. I have to say it may be the best noodles I've had with this type of soup.  The soup itself is basic beef soup with thin slices of beef (similar to in pho) and veggies.SLICED NOODLES - I swear I ordered 1209 but when it came out, it was stir fried and not in soup.  Some of the labels say in soup so the others probably aren't.  I think in the end, they thought I ordered 1210 (the lining of the numbers and their descriptions seem to be a bit off).  In the end, I wasn't disappointed.  The sliced noodles are more like knife cut, roughly cut, scissor cut noodles that are equally as chewy but more flat and thick.  Very good.  I got it with veggies so it came with lots of choy, celery and tomatoes.  I think if I were to ever come back I would try it with soup but the stir fried was very good.Overall, definitely recommend if you love noodles.",4.0,4.0,155,2017-11-15,43.65239,-79.397391,"Chinese , Noodles , Ramen"
Homemade Ramen,"Haven't been here for a few years but wanted to check it out again. It's always packed and when a restaurant has survived over a year, there is typically something going for it.The ramen (hand pulled or sliced) is reasonably priced at $8.50-10. Big portions. I recommend the hand pulled. I always find the sliced/thicker noodles is too much dough in each bite. The broth is nothing to write home about, perhaps lacking in some complexity, however, it will likely satisfy most people. I find the broth at Lanzhou ramen on Dundas is a bit better.Also, got the pork slices in chilli sauce and that was very good as well. Was compiled with peanuts, other spices, overall a good option.

Homemade Ramen,"This is the place to go for noodles downtown. They come in a variety of sizes, types, meat and veggie pairings and spice levels so you will be sure to find something that suits your mood. The noodles are made fresh by a guy throwing the dough around in the back (it's noisy, so expect lots of banging noises). I had the hand pulled noodles in broth with beef and pickled veggies. The broth came out hot and steaming (I hate lukewarm soup),and the noodles were suitably chewy. It was a simple meal with all the right components, nothing fancy or too inventive.

My friend and I both got the noodle soup and although it was filling, I think I'll give their fried noodles a try next time. I'm not sure if I just wasnt a fan of the noodle soup or if it was the noodles itself. They were really chewy and I eventually actually got tired of eating them as it became a workout for my jaw.

Homemade Ramen,"Homemade Ramen is DELICIOUS. It's so hard to find a decently priced restaurant with good tasting food these days... and especially difficult in Downtown Toronto! But this place really hits the spot. It's one of the cleaner places in Chinatown and the staff do a good job at maintaining the place and serving their customers.The menu is also very extensive... be warned that you may spend quite some time just going through everything that's available. There's sliced noodles, hand-pulled noodles, stir fry, dumplings, bao, chinese hamburgers, cold dishes, etc (and I'm not even listing the 382901329 variations of each). Most hand pulled noodle places/ ramen places only have limited selection of flavours, so i really appreciate the diversity this place offers.What's really great is that they have a chicken broth option too! Most chinese noodle places only have beef, pork-based broths... seafood if lucky. And they did a really great job making the chicken soup flavourful and homey tasting. I would definitely recommend the Chicken and Mushroom hand-pulled noodles if you are going for a wholesome feel-good type of meal.Overall, super delicious food for under $10.

Everything was serve quickly and was fresh and tasty. The noodles were extremely fresh and tasty. The broth was very light but flavorful. I had veggies with my ramen noodles with beef added.

Homemade Ramen,We came here on a Monday. There's a good amount of seating in the restaurant and it was decently full on a Monday Night. There's relatively cheap parking walking distance by on Sullivan. We had prompt service. I opted for the braised beef noodle and the pancake. The pancake was okay. The noodles were tender and the broth was clean. There was a good amount of noodles. I opted to add the fried egg and thought it went well with the dish. I added some chilli oil for a kick and thought it was the perfect dish for a cold day. The beef was pretty tender and overall thought the meal was good value.

We've had the stir fried noodles with both thin and wide noodles. We preferred the wide. I tried both the beef brisket and chicken with mushroom with thin noodles.

Homemade Ramen,"the restaurant name is a bit misleading - note this is NOT ramen (typically a japan dish unless you are referring to the packaged variety that college students live off of), but is actually a chinese noodle shop! good thing the yelp search function works properly, because when i searched for chinese noodles, this was one of the top hits that came up near where we were staying.absolutely delicious beef noodle soup and really hit the spot to satisfy our chinese noodle cravings. choose the type of noodle you want - either hand pulled or knife cut. i tried both and thought they were great. normally i'm a knife cut noodles type of person, but on that particular day i was craving hand pulled and it definitely delivered.the only reason they don't get 5 stars is because of the service - we arrived to a full house but were first in line for the next open table. Given that there's nowhere near the entrance to wait around, we waited inside near the front of the restaurant where the cash register was, but made sure that several waitresses knew we were there and waiting for a table. 10 minutes later, another group of people walked in and were seated at a table near the entrance that happened to be leaving just as they arrived. UM HELLO, WE WERE HERE FIRST! you best believe i put on my most annoyed voice and made sure that the head waitress knew that we had just been snubbed. NOT COOL.they did seat us at the next available table that freed up, but boy did that leave a not-so-great first impression.i see some recent reviews mention that this is cash only, but we were able to pay with credit card just fine. no minimum limit as far as we could tell.",4.0,4.0,155,2017-10-11,43.65239,-79.397391,"Chinese , Noodles , Ramen"

We've tried their beef and chicken skewers but I'm not a fan of cumin which this is drenched in. In terms of mains, we order sliced noodle in braised beef and ramen noodle in sliced beef.

Homemade Ramen,A noodle place that is a favourite amongst UT students and a place my co-workers say I should frequent whenever I'm in the area. I finally made an effort to dine-in at Homemade Ramen and it did not disappoint. Ordered the famous non-spicy sliced beef noodles. Portions are huge and the beef is delicious but definitely not as chewy as I imagined. You can easily share 2 bowls of noodles amongst 3 individuals because I barely finished my bowl. Soup is not bad but you can taste a little MSG in there. $10-11 all-in for a bowl of delicious handmade noodles is pretty fab.Ever so often you will be able to hear the sound of the chef slamming the handmade noodles onto the table so don't be startled by the loud thuds!,4.0,4.0,155,2016-12-04,43.65239,-79.397391,"Chinese , Noodles , Ramen"

Smoque N’ Bones,"Ive been literally to every corner in USA for BBQ so anything outside of America will be hard to beat!!! Make no mistake i am a BBQ connoisseur.This place is located next to the 7-11 with zero parking around. We asked the cashier at 7-Eleven if we can park in the corner of their lot, and he obliged but we bought some stuff off of 7-Eleven as well. You can literally pass by this place and not see anything so I'm using the 7-Eleven as a landmark.You walk in and the tables are very small or there is bar seating. This is why it is a good idea to make a reservation for this place especially if you know you're going to be coming on a busy night like a Saturday or Friday. I sat by the bar so I was able to see the girl making the drinks I ordered their signature drink which is like an 86 or something like that it was very good. Everything is cooked out in the open if you sit by the bar so it's interesting to see what they're making for everybody. The big mistake that I made is that I just ordered off the menu but really look to see what everyone else is ordering because you may be disappointed. I ordered the brisket the smallest brisket they had and they were very thin slices of beef and I did not get full at all so I had to end up getting other things. The highlight of my meal was the smoked chicken wings they were very good! They are smoked and then they flash fry it upon order. Make sure you ask for some of their magic rub because that seasoning is literally what will make a kick out of everything. This place was nothing to write home about and I have had bigger portions a barbecue elsewhere but if you're looking for a cute scenspot with some pretty good grub come here!",4.0,4.0,303,2017-12-22,43.645703,-79.410743,Barbeque

Smoque N’ Bones,"Made a reservation through OpenTable and was asked to select a 'table type' and I selected 'Standard' coz I don't want to dine in the bar or counter. But guess what, we still ended up sitting in one of the most uncomfortable bar stool you can imagine! We asked if we can go to the 2nd floor and they said it's not open, we asked if we can seat in one of their 4 seater table since it's not busy anyway and they said no too. So we were given a table underneath the stairs and we're really disappointed coz why do you get to choose your table upon reservation and in the end they put you to this lousy inconvenient tables/area. Plus the tables/stools are so tiny that you don't have anyplace to put down your coat.  Yes they do have a coat rack, the kind that can accommodate 2-3 coats lol. And since there's already coats hanging in the rack, our coats stayed in our lap for the duration of our dining. Talk about having an enjoyable dinner, NOT!And the food, OMG I don't understand why people give this restaurant 4 or 5 stars since the food is nothing spectacular!  Ordered the following BBQ:- 1/2 lbs Side Ribs - they were tough and dry. For $19.90 you would think that you're getting at least decent ribs but oh no you're not! I'd rather eat Swiss Chalet's ribs (and I hate hate Swiss Chalet) that's when you know Smoque N' Bones' ribs are bad.- Their Smoked Chicken ($16.90) is the same story, tasted more like burnt than smokey.SIDES:- Sweet Potato Waffle Fries($7.90) - of all the food we ordered, this is the only thing we enjoyed. The natural sweetness of the potatoes and its crunchy texture makes this an okay dish.- Grilled Corn with Chipotle Mayo & Smoked Cheddar (6.90) - they split 1 corn into two, slathered it with mayo and cheese and charge you almost 7 bucks for a side that doesn't even taste good. Nothing special, I bet you can make this yourself and it won't cost you this much.Overall after experiencing back problems and sore behind (from the hard uncomfortable stools), unaccommodating service and uninspired/expensive food, there's no way I'm coming back here.",4.0,2.0,303,2017-12-04,43.645703,-79.410743,Barbeque

Smoque N’ Bones,"FOOD (4 stars)Smoque N' Bones was on my bookmarks for a while.  Today we came with another couple.  Our group was four people.  We ordered only 1 SAMPLER FOR TWO, which was $59.99.  We chose  1/2 PORK RIBS RACK, ¼ peppercorn BEEF,  1/2 lb. SAUSAGES and three sides were BRUSSELS SPROUTS, BUTTERMILK ONION RINGS and GRILLED CORN.  We also added on Rib tips and Cornbread. I love almost of all dishes.  They were DELICIOUS!  I was just a bit sad about the grilled corn.  They were quite small and dry in my opinion. However, I really want to try other dishes.  Their side dishes look very interesting.  I saw the table next to us ordered the Sweet potato waffle fries. They seemed to like it a lot.   Drinks (4 stars)I got my fave ""BLOODY CAESAR.""  I'm a light weight person.  This drink was so good and made me turn red! lolMy friend and my husband had SWEET TEA, Lemonade, Can-Woodhouse and a pint of Sam Adams.  I was sure they didn't have any problem with those drinks because they vanished! SERVICE (2 stars)Sad sad sad.  Upset and upset.  The waiter seemed very impatient.  We didn't spend much time to order. He didn't even wait for a minute.  He really wanted to leave all the time.  We knew that you were busy, but it annoyed us too when our server didn't care to take an order or give us a warm welcoming.  We were not here for only food.  We all expect a pleasant service in return for giving the restaurant business.  They might be short of staff or be too busy because of take-out?  I hope they would improve their service if they care about their customers. AMBIANCE (3.5 stars)They have two floors, but they didn't open the upper floor on the day we went.  We got the seat next to the opened window.  The weather was nice during the day so it was very nice for us.

I'm not a fan of beef brisket but this was the star dish for me. Soooo soft and tender! You won't regret getting this.

So coming in to this restaurant I really hoped it wouldn't leave a bad taste.I got the sampler platter for two because we wanted to try as much as possible to see what we like and what we don't. We had ribs, brisket, and pulled pork accompanied by Mac and cheese, cornbread, and sweet potato cross-cut fries. The brisket was good, but I personally prefer thicker slices. The ribs were great and cooked properly. The pulled pork was a little too dry. Mac and cheese didn't have enough cheese. Cornbread had great butter, but just didn't have the right texture to me. The sweet potato fries were fried really well.I had their homemade sweet tea, but hopefully next time I'll try to hit up their bourbon selection. The sweet tea itself was a little too sweet, but maybe that was from the oranges they put into the tea.Service was extremely friendly and courteous, there are a lot of staff in the restaurant for the space they have.Prices are higher than what I'm used to paying for BBQ, but I suppose that's the sacrifice of not being in Atlanta or the Midwest US. The prices are reasonable sitting around ~$20-30/person.Walking in, you can smell the smoker. Decor is rustic and the dim lighting helps with the look. The kitchen is open, so you can see everything that goes on. Definitely recommend this place.

Smoque N’ Bones,"Very disappointed with the service and food especially. I came here cause I heard really good things about the food and did some yelp too. Upon entering the restaurant we were seated underneath the stairs in the hall way where it was inconvenient as every time someone needed to get through my bf had to move while he was eating. They claimed the normal tables in the front were all reserved.... and yet 1-2 hours later nobody sat in them at all. Completely empty. Upon finally deciding what to order, we couldn't find a waitress or waiter in sight. And when we did it was when their whole staff got together in the front room to drink a glass of tequila, while they ignored us waiving them down to order. It was very unprofessional to drink on the job ! Especially at the cost of ignoring your guests. When we did have contact with the wait staff finally the 1 girl wearing a sports cap was dismissive and not responsive when we asked for condiments etc. They forgot 2 of the items we ordered, and never bothered to check with us that we received them anyways. And when the food arrived they dumped it on our tables in a disastrous mess, and stared at us to move all the stuff they previously put down all over the place so they wouldn't have to touch our plates. Not sure why you are even a waitress if you don't want to do your job in at least presenting our food properly. Anyway onto the food. We ordered the baby back ribs full rack. Were told they're fatty but upon receiving them unfortunately the meat was very tough, burned to a crisp and not very flavourful. The beet salad, sweet potato waffle fries and onion rings sadly were the only good thing about our visit and to be honest you gotta be a bad chef to mess those things up. So unfortunately the BBQ was not the highlight and never will be in my eyes. The brisket was cold and tough too my bf had stated during the meal. 2 hours after leaving I had food poisoning from their food.

Smoque N’ Bones,"What's left to be said about this place? There's a reason for the stockpile of reviews - and good ones too! If you're craving smoky, comforting, delicious BBQ meats with a nice flavourful kick, this place is for you. Located in the heart of Queen West, we visited on a Tuesday evening and the place was packed - so word of warning, note that space is pretty intimate, limited, and narrow. Although we did enjoy our experience here, we probably would have enjoyed it more if we hadn't been cramped at the back corner of the bar.We ordered the pulled pork ($8.90 for a half size), beef brisket ($11.90 for a half size), half-sized smoked chicken ($14.90), brussel sprouts ($6.90), and buttermilk onion rings ($6.90). The brussel sprouts were a bit too salty for our liking, but everything else was delicious. The onion rings are perfectly crispy, and the meats are lathered in flavour with a smokiness that's cooked to perfection. If you haven't been here yet, stop by when you have a chance - especially if you're a dedicated carnivore, or just a lover of all things BBQ.

Smoque N’ Bones,"We went here for my brother's b-day.  My sister booked us a reservation. However; we had to wait 20 minutes before being seated because the server/ hostess did not want to disrupt the other people in our reserved table, which were done their meal and were sitting around with water and chatting - the quintessential indication of a completed meal!Thankfully, this meant that we could find a seat upstairs, which was being opened for their dinner service. They had their upstairs booked but a time window of an hour and a 45 mins was more than enough time. We ate our meal gleefully. We ordered: The Sampler for two with 1/2 rack, beef brisket, and sausage and corn bread, Brussels sprouts and some pickled cabbage. Additionally the onion rings and a beet salad for my dad and brother. I ordered: a Cobb salad minus the bacon and sweet potato waffle fries and my sister ordered the chicken poppers and the shoestring fries. We also ordered a couple of housemade root beers and some cranberry juice. The atmosphere was alright. Their upstairs was echoey,  and a little on the cold side.

Smoque N’ Bones,"This is by far one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto!Right when you walk in, the smell from the open cooked meat is a mouth watering experience.  In the summer, the front has a garage like door that opens up to the street and really helps create a Toronto experience like no other.  The second floor has a nice open setting and great selection of fine whisky.The food is incredible. Each time I have went, my brother has shown me how sharing everything off the menu is the best option when you're with a group. They have a delicious Mac and cheese (although the portion is small, so order a couple).  The ribs are absolutely amazing and should be the first thing you order.  A real smoked taste.  The pulled pork is also a great option; it is exceptional.Don't forget to make a reservation! I find a lot of people complain about not getting a table or something but its TORONTO! Also, one of the best spots in TORONTO.  Make a reservation, enjoy the night out with your friends or family.",4.0,5.0,303,2017-12-02,43.645703,-79.410743,Barbeque
Smoque N’ Bones,"This rating is given by a tiny eater like myself. I did enjoy my experience here but the menu was limited and pricey- after all, they specialize in ribs. I ordered the starter riblets with BBQ sauce, my boyfriend got the buttermilk chicken and we shared the sweet potato waffle fries (thank you Yelpers for the recommendation!). The riblets were the ends of the rack and the bbq sauce was amazing! The chicken was insanely juicey and tender with a thin crisp batter. The chicken alone wasn't special and almost tasted too dull but with the spicy mayo, it was something else! Sweet potato fries also came with the spicy mayo. We loved that each fry was evenly seasoned without overpowering the sweet potato taste. After this meal though, I was EXTREMELY thirsty. The food was tasty overall but this kind of meaty restaurant just isn't my type.",4.0,3.0,303,2017-02-05,43.645703,-79.410743,Barbeque
Smoque N’ Bones,We came for the sampler. The pulled pork was tasty. The sweet potato fries were not bad. The ribs I find them okay as they don't fall off the bone. What stood out in my mind were the corns. It's so tasty. The corn was fresh and sweet with grilled cheddar. All the flavours were a good marriage. Basically when you eat that you don't want anyone to talk to you to distract you.,4.0,4.0,303,2017-08-29,43.645703,-79.410743,Barbeque
Smoque N’ Bones,"My god, is this place good. I have had a variety of barbecue throughout the city, and Smoque n' Bones has to be the best. The atmosphere of the place fits entirely with the BBQ vibe and feels very warm and cozy. For a bonus experience, sit at the bar and watch as they prepare everything. You may even get a sample or two. The platters for two are the best for a variety of meats and sides. We got about three of them for a birthday and made sure to get about one of everything. The pulled pork and ribs are outstanding. The sausage is mouthwatering and highly underrated. The brisket is great. They don't skimp on sides either. The cornbread is my favourite with the maple butter, but the onion rings, Brussels sprouts are a close second.Try the maple bacon bourbon. Amazing. Best drink I've ever had. Go there.

Smoque N’ Bones,"Really good ribs, maybe the best I've tried in Toronto. Would have rated 4 or maybe even 5 stars, but just had a pretty bad service experience.After ordering desserts and and waiting for 15+ minutes, I asked a server to check in on the order. She comes back and just says it'll be out in a few minutes without any explanation. When the bread pudding finally arrived, I asked her straight up, so did you guys just forget the order or something? And she says, ""oh yeah, someone forgot to put it"" in and walked away, and it was just left at that, I don't think she even said sorry.Most restaurants comp something when they forget to put in an order for that long. I'm not saying they needed to do that or anything, but man, at least own up to it and be a little apologetic when you forget a customer's order.",4.0,3.0,303,2017-10-09,43.645703,-79.410743,Barbeque
Otto’s Bierhalle,"I came in with a group of 8 people. We were quickly seated after a few moments at the bar. The night ambiance is very different than the day pictures described on their website. I enjoyed it. We got the Schweinshaxe, Brussel Sprouts, and Sauerkraut Fritter w/ a Donut beer and Hefeweizen. Schweinshaxe was delicious. A crispy delicious pork that easily feeds 2 people. I loved the excessiveness of it. I had seen someone eating one in Germany over this past summer and loved having the opportunity to have one myself. The Brussel Sprouts were sweet. The amount was just right for the two of us. The Sauerkraut Fritters were light and tasty.The Donut beer was a spontaneous decision. Right before I made it I was tasting a few different beers with the bartender we had. It was the right choice. We followed it with the Hefeweizen for what I'd imagine a classic German bier. Great environment filled with friendly hosts, delicious food, and tasty beer. All of my friends had a great time during our dinner.",4.0,5.0,86,2018-01-15,43.643248,-79.422078,German

I've had the schnitzel and bratwurst, along with some other charcuterie and sausages - and I really liked most of the items!

There were 7 of us and we were seated immediately because we had reservation. the place is dimly lit with fluorescent bulbs and vines from the ceiling - because of this it gave it a romantic vibe. as well, each toilet stall had a button that when pressed, the lights changed into disco or black lights with music - kinda like a mini club i got the cowbell belgian eggnog ale - and considering the fact that I'm not much of a beer person, i enjoyed drinking it. it wasn't too bitter and it had a rich creamy finish.we all shared the 3 cheese fondue with pretzels - came with 4 big pieces of pretzels. in my opinion, this dish was very salty. a lot of kosher salt on the pretzels alone and the cheeses used just exacerbated the saltiness of it.for mains, i got the pork belly with apple compote which had been soud vide until crispy +  a beet salad served with pieces of goat cheese + their own version of mac & cheese. everything was so delicious i have nothing bad to say! the portions seemed small initially but they filled me up. i liked the fact that the prices were very decent there",4.0,4.0,86,2018-01-05,43.643248,-79.422078,German

Otto’s Bierhalle,"Imagine heading to a new restaurant for dinner at 5pm on a Sunday when the restaurant is set to open. Next, imagine your surprise when the line extends around the corner of the building, and around the corner after that too. You would likely be standing in line like me, with your two other guests thinking WOW! This place must be amazeballs; and getting pretty excited about your latest Yelp find. Now, imagine the embarrassment and devastation when you realize you missed the door to the actual restaurant and you've been standing in line (and nearly got to the front) before you realized you were in line for some concert that has nothing to do with the restaurant; and for which you have no tickets. Cue slinking out of there like nothing is wrong and you knew this all along. Annnyways! Once we found the right door there was no wait, it wasn't too busy, and we got a small table to ourselves. There are several other longer communal tables as well. It is a bright and spacious place. They were playing Frankenstein on the wall, with a projector I'm guessing. The bathrooms are also worth venturing to. Push the button on the wall! The service was an easy 5 stars-- very friendly and super helpful when navigating the menu. Loved how the bartender came to the tables to serve the drinks. We shared the Vienna platter between three of us. We had MORE than enough food; and my boyfriend and I both commented it would have been too much for just the two of us. I would highly recommend the platter; and next time I would also consider just ordering a whole bunch of the sides. Some of my faves: Sauerkraut fritters, pretzel with grainy mustard, roasted brussels sprouts, spatz and cheese, house made pickles. Who am I kidding...I loved it all! Not a beer drinker so can't help there- but my boyfriend and his friend both loved the beers they tried (can't remember the names though). I like sweet ciders and really enjoyed the Duxbury cider. I also tried the West Ave and hated it. It was flavorless and super dry. Dessert:  Black Forest dacquoise. It was very good - I actually would have been ok with just the homemade, rich chocolate mousse and sour cherries. These were phenomenal. The actual cake left something to be desired.

Otto’s Bierhalle,"I went back again but this time, I brought more friends so I can try MORE food!Of course, we cant say we've eaten here without the pork hock. But this time we ordered the combos. Because we had four people, we decided to order the Bavaria platter. Had the porkhock, the sausage, sweet pickles, fries, grilled vegetables to name a few on this big tray. I thought that's a good way to sample some of the good food this restaurant got. After the recommendation of Martin, because our feast combo didn't have the rouladen, essentially a roll of beef rolled and stuffed with smoked cured meat, we ordered that on the side and boy, was that a good decision too. This restaurant is a great restaurant for meat lovers because there's a lot of meat (just the pork hock alone can fill you up real good between two to three people) and it's good for a good group of friends or families. The food came really fast and the beers were huge. Some beers were as large as 20 oz!! Every time I go, I always have a fantastic time!!",4.0,5.0,86,2017-10-17,43.643248,-79.422078,German
Otto’s Bierhalle,"Oktoberfest screams beer and meat, does it not? It's time to walk through Trinity Bellwoods, see the fall colours and visit Otto's. The sign is not so obvious, so make sure you watch out for it! Seating consists of long tables as well as bar seating. It's an airy space with large windows., but really loud, even when it's not a full house! We settled in and took a look at the delightful beer menu. They offer several local brews and well as German. Since we're in Toronto AND can have these delightful local beers any time we want, it's time to cut the cord and order something new. We stuck with the German beer, but it wasn't easy! My friend chose the Schneiders Original and I had the Paulaner Hefe-Weissbier. Both are solid wheat beers. The Paulaner smelled of citrus and cloves; tasted smooth, a little sweet, a little malt with a clean finish. Tasty! There were many meaty choices on the menu, so we grabbed the Oktoberfest Platter. It was piled high with bratwurst, weisswurst, hot kransky and bockwurst. There was also fries, coleslaw and housemade pickles. It was the wurst! (Terrible pun, I know!) I'm not a spicy gal, but that hot kransky was freaking hot! Glad I had a cold beer in hand! The service was great. They understand the meaty and beery needs of their patrons and serve them well!

Otto’s Bierhalle,"Amazing place with delicious food and extremely friendly service! Don't come here expecting anything fancy or classy - as its name suggests, this is a bierhalle filled with lots of beer, noise, conversation, and laughter!We ordered a schweinshaxe (the waitress taught us to pronounce it as schvein-hacks-e) and an Oktoberfest platter to share. The platter came with four wursts, slaw, Otto's fries, pickles, and sauerkraut. I personally found all the wursts to be delicious, but my absolutely favourite was the hot kransky, and then the bratwurst. My parents and sister didn't like the weisswurst (they found the texture off-putting and the flavour bland), but I quite enjoyed it!The house pickles were delicious, and the coleslaw wasn't doused in heavy mayo. Instead, it was slightly oily but still fairly light. The fries were a major hit, and so crispy.The roasted pork hock really stole the show. The skin was unbelievably crispy, and there was a crackle with every bite. Be warned, however, as it is quite fatty. Every bite gushed with oil, but the hock also had a significant amount of collagen (mmm). It's a little on the greasy and heavy side, so be sure to share it with a larger group!We were completely stuffed by the end of the meal, and had to take the wurst leftovers and remaining pork hock to go. My parents were ecstatic about using the pork hock to make congee... Oh, the life of a Chinese family haha!Definitely would recommend, especially for large groups looking to have a good time!",4.0,5.0,86,2017-10-23,43.643248,-79.422078,German

The interior is strange with unfinished stucco type walls and ceilings.Lot's of sitting room.. if they let you sit together.My group of at the time 6 soon to be more was told we couldn't sit together even though half the restaurant was empty.After about 10 minutes they invited us to come join a large table to accomidate everyone.. whodathunkit!The food was interesting, I got a schnitzel on a bun with a tiny child size bowl of grilled veggies. The schnitzel was good but the bun was gooped up with a ton of mayo which I ended up wiping off cuz mayo is gross. Needless to say I was still hungry after my meal.One of the people in my group had even worse service. The kitchen gave her meal to someone else, and she had to wait and watch the rest of us finish our meal before she got hers.

Ottos also has amazing dishes to share for a late night snack. Great place to go at night for a drink out, more relaxed but gets noisy.HOWEVER, they also serve brunch. And it is amazing. They have platters served on treys that are for sharing; amazing poached eggs, array of sausages, potatoes, fruit, etc. perfect for nice photos and to share with large groups.

Otto’s Bierhalle,"Awesome food and beer here!Otto's Bierhalle was on my top list.  I wanted to try their PORK HOCK (SCHWEINSHAXE) for a long time. It was good as it claimed to be.  This is the Must-Try! I would recommend it to everyone. Food (4.75/5)Everything was almost perfect. We love everything.  What did we order? Here..- SCHWEINSHAXE or Roasted Crispy Skin Pork Hock ($26) (5/5).  The meat itself was very juicy, tender and tasty.  The skin was very crunchy and only little salty.  You can eat the pork by itself without any dipping sauce or have a dap of HOT MUSTARD.  I'm not sure how many types of mustards the restaurant provides but our server brought us a Triple-Hot Mustard.  They came in three small bowls and had slightly different tastes.  They might be called Hot Raddish, Sweet Russian and Sour Crunch!? Lol, I'm not sure about their names though. They were good!  They can make you eat more meat ^^.  This pork hock was huge!  I think it can feed at least 3-4 people.  We were only two people.  We couldn't finish it, so we got the leftover packed home.  Aww~ Pork hock sandwiches for tomorrow Yum!- ROAST PORK BELLY W/ APPLE COMPOTE  ($9) (4/5).  The pork belly was 24-hours sous vided.  It came with apple compote.  It was juicy and good with the apple compote.  However, it wasn't as crispy as I expected.  They came in two small pieces.  I would feel much better if their portion was more generous than the ones they served.  - ROASTED BRUSSEL SPROUTS ($6) (5/5).  I love roasted Brussel sprouts as long as I don't cook them by myself lol. I'm not good at cooking that was why I prefer to eat out.  Anyway, roasting is always the best way to cook brussel sprout, isn't it?  Sauteed is good too.  They both are a good pair with meat and beer. - SAUERKRAUT FRITTERS ($6) (4/5)  It wasn't hot when it came.  I know that they have to prepare everything ahead of time and everything seem to take lots of time to be prepared.  I'm not saying that the fritters were not good. They were good.  I like the breadcrumbs and the sauerkraut inside, but I just prefer the hot version ;)- SAUERKRAUT or pickled chopped cabbage ($4) (4/5).  One word...""sour!"" lol We need it right? Because of all the greasy stuff, you consume, you will need something sour like sauerkraut or assorted pickles to tone it down a bit. - OTTO'S HAND-CUT FRIES W/ REMOULADE  ($6) (4/5). Fries were small and skinny lol. They were perfectly cooked, crunchy and tasted good; only they weren't hot. DRINK (4/5)- 20 oz HOFBRAU DUNKEL ($8.95).  My husband preferred this beer than Muddy York beer.  - 20oz MUDDY YORK ($7.95).  - 14 oz FUNF HACKER ($5 during Happy Hours). I love this beer.  It tasted like cider to me  :)SERVICE (3.75/5)Nothing was wrong with the service, but nothing was special either. I didn't want to blame our server.  He was busy and ran around the restaurant all the time.  However, it was a little frustrating when we needed someone to help us out.  We had to wait for a long time to catch his eyes.  I actually didn't know how the service works in this restaurant.  It seemed no one else came to check on us or even looked at us.  If other staff looked at us sometimes, they might be able to call our server for us.  Do they have bussers or any server assistants?  By the way, our server did everything when we asked for it promptly.  He even changed a new beer for my husband because my husband might not mention the full name of the beer or the server didn't catch it.  He got him Hofbrau ORIGINAL instead of Hofbrau DUNKEL at first. Normally, we don't ask to change it back.  We just take it.  However, he didn't like the taste of the Hofbrau ORIGINAL.  Thanks to our server again.AMBIANCE (4.5/5)- I love the ambience.  It was very cozy and not too loud. They have tall chairs and regular chairs for customers. We got the tall chairs though.  I found out that it wasn't for me lol.  I will ask for normal setas next time.  I'm kind of not tall lol so I felt a bit strange to sit in the tall chair. Please don't judge!- Washrooms.  You must check it out! Don't be shy to go to each one and try the different experiences of light and sound! Step in there and press the BIG BUTTON!

After a few pints and the loud music, things get disorienting)Whether it be the way the Germans raise their pigs to the way they marinate/roast it/fry it/whatever. Toronto was not even close to achieving the same mind blowing flavour that they can. The slaw that was underneath the actual hock was hard for me to eat.

Seating is a combination of communal and individual tables (some high top and some regular). Our server was warm and very friendly, and offered great suggestions/explanations of the menu. The beer selection is awesome and prices reasonable (based on area of the city and the fact many of the beers are European imports). The food was fantastic, and phenomenal value! Three of us split the Vienna feast ($45), plus added one pretzel and one bratwurst. This platter had great variety - 4 types of schnitzel (pork, chicken, halloumi cheese, portobello mushroom) as well as a good selection of sides (Brussels sprouts, slaw, salad, pickles, spaetzle). It came with lemons, mustard, and aioli. Quality of all the meats was better than I expected (very good) and I liked literally everything on the platter. Food came out very quickly, which was appreciated as we were very hungry! Interior of the restaurant is very nice - polished concrete floor, Edison bulbs plus other interesting light fixtures, and tons of plants, including on walls and hanging from the ceiling. There was something interesting to see no matter which direction you looked! Bathrooms are all individual, unisex rooms, the locks didn't seem to work very well (my friend and I both had trouble with them) but this is a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things.

Playa Cabana,"Playa Cabana is about a 15 minute walk from my office and I hadn't planned on going there but the person I had an appointment with nearby wasn't available so I decided to have lunch first.Walking in, it's a very narrow, small space, almost claustraphobic. The dim lighting didn't help but it set an intimate mood for the place. This looks like a nice neighbourhood watering hole and the immediate neighbourhood is mostly residential.I ordered the Tostadas with beef and it was served on a crispy tortilla, topped with lettuce, guacamole, black beans, and a few other ingredients.The presentation was nice and the taste was even nicer!

Playa Cabana,"Before I go into why I gave Playa Cabana 2 stars, I'll give credit where credit is due.  The service here is solid... they quickly addressed the first concerns of the inedible octopus but they also asked how my dish was when they clearly saw that I did not finish one taco of the 3 they gave.  So the really nice server we got was good.  If the kitchen followed the lead of the service, you'd have a good Mexican spot... that sadly didnt happen.On Dupont which looks more of a quiet residential street of Toronto, you'll find a packed, lively, and crowded Playa Cabana.  You can clearly feel the vibe and sounds coming from the restaurant as you walk through the patio.  There's a buzz of activity from the young servers going between the extra squished tables filled with family or older couples that have bags of Royal Doulton and William Sonoma crowding into the minimal walking area.The menu is simple and easy to understand with it looking somewhat reasonably priced... It looks great on the menu till you might get in person and then question the value.  Just a word of caution there.  I should have tempered my expectation on Playa Cabana (even though it is ranked 4 stars) because Carmeka (Chicago yelper before me) mentioned this isnt real Mexican.  After going to Chicago 4 times last year and San Diego the year before, my love for real Mexican is there and this ... isn't it... at all.Guacamole & chips - Simple guacamole with a side of corn chips.  I would say that the flavour compared to what I've had in San Diego is missing... this is far more bland but adding in some heat from the sauces kicks it up.  Chips are a bit thicker than I've experienced but they're crunchy and not oily.  For $9, I find it a bit expensive for the small amount but then again, avocado prices have jumped so maybe it's at the right price point.  3/5Pulpo Taco (Octopus) 2 tacos - Oh Toronto... please do not tell me you think this is 4 star quality octopus taco.  The octopus given was smaller than the length of the fork tines (about an inch or so) and completely rubber... I took a good 20 seconds with a fork and knife just trying to cut through and only got 80% of the way through.  It's supposed to be tender and yet lightly charred at the last minute grilling to get that flavour ... and this wasn't it. Completely inedible.  Thankfully they took off this bill.  1/5Tacos al Pastor (Pork) - We had this rendition at El Loco Local and though I didnt love that version, I felt this one didn't match up that one.  It's supposed to be tender and flavourful pork with pineapple ... the pork was ok and the pineapple was really mandarin or orange segments that tasted overly sugary and syrupy... as if they were canned or jarred.  It didnt have any balance.  2/5Pescado Baja style Tacos (Battered Fish) - This seems like an odd comment but this fish was way too large for the taco and it was buried under way too much shredded cabbage.  I guess it could look instagram pretty at that level but it made it frustrating to eat.  It has zero balance and flavours werent the focus.  In addition to the fish being 2 times the size of the taco shell, the batter was nearly 2 cm thick in some parts.  Overall, there's no flavour.  At least the fish was cooked through, not greasy, and served hot.  That's the only plus.  I didnt even finish one taco.  2/5Horchata - I'm not sure if this is housemade but if it is... its has too much water and sugar.  My favourite is from Chicago where its has a wonderful lingering cinnamon taste and sweetened just right.  The rice is supposed to give it a creaminess instead a watery feel.  This wasn't close.  2/5Maybe we came when their kitchen staff is changing up and learning?  I'm not sure but the recipes here were bland and the execution just left everything inedible.  For $30 per person, we got a lot of inedible food... I'm starting to get the feel that Toronto doesnt do Mexican food well anywhere in our city.",4.0,2.0,366,2017-10-16,43.675958,-79.401184,"Mexican , Bars"
Playa Cabana,"Love this place! I had a mad craving for tacos one day, so I took a detour on my way home from work and stopped in for some Mexican fare. Obviously, I'm not Mexican and I have actually never even been to Mexico, so I'm definitely not qualified to speak about the authenticity of the food here, but I most certainly can comment on the flavours and presentation of the food. My opinion is WOW... just Wow. Seriously delicious food. I had the octopus tacos, guacamole with chips and finished off with crab cakes. I also had a beer, but in hindsight I should've had a margarita instead. They looked delicious! I tried a few different hot sauces, and boy, were they good! A couple were a bit too hot for me, but I enjoyed trying them. I put a couple of drops of each one onto the guacamole as I devoured it, so I could see which one I liked best. The octopus tacos were perfection. I should've ordered double and skipped the crab cakes, as they were not as enjoyable for me. The guacamole was fantastic and I loved the house made chips. Service was exceptional. I sat at the bar on my own and everyone was extremely friendly and I felt very welcome. Oftentimes, when dining solo, I feel a bit out of place or ignored. Not the case here. It seemed that the staff really went out of their way to make me feel at ease and ensure that I had a good experience. What a difference this makes in a dining experience.

That was Delicious!!!!! The shrimps had so much flavor!!! I had the lobster tacos for entree. That was delicious as well. It was bursting with flavor, with a hint of spice, the cheese, tomatoes and guac on the side. Oh man! My friend had the carne asada. The steak was cooked perfectly. Tender and juicy and of course with the sauce on top it was bursting with flavor and a bit spicy. My other friend had the burrito and my husband had the short rib tacos. Alll were super delicious.

Playa Cabana,"Probably the best Mexican food I've ever had! And that's saying a lot because I'm not usually a big fan of Mexican food. This place is tiny but has a few floors as well a couple of balconies. It's super trendy and fun however, and the food is great and decently priced. Some items like the corn ($10) are a bit expensive in my opinion for the portion. Most of the party got the short rib tacos, these came on a crispy shell, I had the fish tacos which were in a soft shell, and you can order them singularly or in orders of 3. The tacos aren't quite a meal in my opinion, but accompanied by an order of the corn, split between two people and the guacamole and chips, I was stuffed. The tacos are great, loaded with some nice fresh ingredients. I preferred my fish tacos to the short rib ones, the batter was light and crispy and came out piping hot, only to be cooled and freshened up by some crisp veggies and a great sauce. I'm not sure what the fish was however! The short rib were also great, the shell was crisp but not like a old El Paso taco kit, still had some flexibility to it so it didn't fall apart. The meat was flavourful and tender as well. The guacamole was delicious, definitely a must have, and the corn was also great, a bit spicy and a bit cheesy. The restaurant is a great space, it looks like a house from the outside and it's ultra trendy inside, fun music and the service was great and friendly. Water glasses and drinks were filled constantly, however the glasses were quite small so they were being refilled a lot! Overall a fun place to go with friends or a date. I would definitely come back for the fish tacos and guacamole. The octopus tacos looked pretty good as did the burritos, might be worth a try next time!",4.0,5.0,366,2017-07-10,43.675958,-79.401184,"Mexican , Bars"
Playa Cabana,"Location: Right by Dupont subway station. There are some paid parking nearby.Price: Overall, it came down to around $25/person after ordering appetizers, tacos/burritos, and alcoholic drinks. Food: The fried baha fish tacos were delicious! The batter is thin and super crispy, but not oozing grease. I'd say this is a must-get, especially if you're pain-avoidant and can't handle spice. The octopus tacos were very tender, yet charred just enough for the flavour to be strong. It's on the spicy side though, but you can ask for the non-spice version. Their home-made nachos were thick and crispy. They also offer sugar-cane Coca cola if you want to avoid high fructose corn syrup drinks. The burrito was gigantic and covered in sauce and veggies. Service: Very quick service, and the waiter was very helpful.Overall: delicious Mexican food that's well cooked. Book ahead if you want a place inside.

Playa Cabana,"So you and your friend have a hankering for Mexican food  while downtown....I wanted to see if this place was about the food or about the flash. Located at 111 Davenport Rd, ( note: they have a second location in the junction) it is a little hidden from the main strip of the Avenue Rd / Yorkville restaurants. It felt to me more of a locals hangout as the customers and staff seemed familiar with each other. The restaurant is small and cozy with a very nice patio. Decor was nice and tasteful unlike some other Mexican places that want to scream at you that they are Mexican (Also, I'm glad they didn't do that whole ""day of the dead"" theme that a lot of places are doing these days) anyway, now to the food. They have a good menu that highlights the usual fare. Tacos, enchiladas, as well as main plates. The liquor menu is what you would expect in a Mexican restaurant with lots of tequila choices and Mexican beer. ( $20 for a 5 bucket of beer) I started with a Dave's margarita on he rocks( they don't serve the slushy kind) and the usual guacamole dip and the daily ceviche both served in a stone bowl and made fresh. Both were excellent and well made. I opted for the Carne Asada platter with beans and rice and tortillas. The presentation was nice and the portions were good. Now I have had this dish at other places before (in Mexico) and I prefer my meat cooked and served without sauce on it. The flank steak was good but it was cover in the sweet sauce that overpowered the flavour of the meat. The sauce was good and maybe it should be used as a side but not smothering the meat. Everything else was cooked perfectly and very tasteful.  Overall this place is good and well deserving of a try. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the sauce over the meat thing ....mmmm meat....",4.0,4.0,366,2017-09-17,43.675958,-79.401184,"Mexican , Bars"

Lobster was soft and succulent. The guac that came with it also tasted incredibly fresh. -Baja fish tacos (battered): I'd say overall they were tasty and fresh, but nothing out of this world. I like how they didn't over-batter the fish. -Dave's margarita. Maybe a little too much ice, but still went down smoothly. The space is a bit cramped, so it's probaly not the best option for an intimate one-on-one. Music can be a bit loud. On the plus side, our server was friendly and very attentive.

Playa Cabana,"A lot of Pros/Cons to come...Went here for a birthday dinner, and was seated inside... boy - was that a mistake.  There were only 4 of us and it was wayyy too tight! Two people literally cannot stand side by side. It was VERY hot, and very small. It is a great little hole-in-the-wall restaurant... which is literally a tiny hole in the wall.  If possible, ask to be seated outside!The Guacamole/Salsa were great - and was a good size to share among 4 people.  Would definitely recommend. We ordered a number of plates to share... but to be honest, I was not blown away by their tacos.  Definitely much bigger than El Carnita - that's for sure, and MUCH better value - but the taste was pretty average. We ordered... Tacos de: Pollo al Carbon, Pescado, Carnitas.The Mexican Street Corn is always my favourite part of these types of restaurants! Must have. The waiter was fantastic, and gave us a really cool run-down and lesson on types of Tequilas and Margaritas.  We were very appreciative!

The place is pretty small but I like the vibe of the place. There are a few areas can accommodate group of 6-8 people. Service is prompt and friendly. My review is based on my lunch time experience. Two of us shared two appetizers and one burrito. Poblano corn crab cake with fresh Dungeness crab - they have rich taste of crab and the sauce is very, but I wish the crab meat could be more moist in terms of textureTacos de Pulpo (our favourite)- First I couldn't find it from the main course Taco section, but found it in the appetizer. A order comes with two tacos. Each one has a big piece of tentacle with spicy guacamole and corn topping. The tentacle is very tender and flavourful. Love this dish very much!! Toluca Chorizo Burrito- Chorizo is flavourful and well mixed with rice and the sunny side up Egg enhance the flavour and texture. The green and red tomato sauce are nicely down. The portion is quite sizeable for one person.

Playa Cabana,"We were driving back from a cottage in Brighton and wanted to pick up food to eat at home. You know, avoid having to make food when we're already so tired? Playa Cabana was on our way and it's one of those spots that we've wanted to try out, but just haven't gotten to.We popped in and ordered the chicken and pastor (soft) tacos and a horchata for while we waited on our order.I found the service to be friendly and overall efficient and extremely fast. The food was done before we even got through half the drink. The horchata, while good, was not as great as we've had elsewhere in the city. I found that it was at once refreshing going down the throat but leaving your mouth with a dry feeling (which made you think you were thirsty).Later when we got home to eat, the shells were coming apart a bit (likely from condensation) but the meat was amazing. The pastor is a bit spicy but delicious and the chicken balanced out the spiciness of our meal.While there, we discussed how the location was compact which created a sense of intimacy, but it wasn't romantic in the classic sense, making it a great spot for new dates.

Katsuya,"A great place to grab Katsu and unlimited refills of miso soup!My friends and I came in at around 9PM today and we were seated by the windows due to the lack of space to accommodate us. After twenty minutes or so, they let us move to a table where all three of us could sit and talk comfortably (Don't remember the names of these dishes 100% so please bare with me!)We got the pork loin original katsu while my other friend ordered the curry tender katsu. The curry definitely had a strong taste to it unlike the original, and I found to like it more since I'm a huge fan of strong curry. I also found that the pork loin was a lot more tender than pork tender... which sounds odd at first, but I highly recommend the pork loin over the pork tender. The pork loin was soft enough to be cut by a spoon!Unlimited refills of miso soup are always great. Despite multiple requests from my table for it, the waiters never hesitated to give more to us. I felt like I was treated very well during my visit here!Some tips:- they do not accept credit card, but they do accept Apple Pay!- all tonkotsu sets come with free refills of miso soup (so ordering an appetizer won't get you the soup)- the seats aren't designed in a way to hold your jacket, but they do have racks on the side-",4.0,5.0,214,2018-01-06,43.789922,-79.41846,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"

However, the texture of the chicken was rather mushy and really lack of meat texture.My husband ordered the pork katsu and was better in terms of meat texture. Nevertheless, we both like their chili sauce a lot. My house special had a nice hint of peanuts, which is not bad. His chili sauce was a definite hit with both of us.

I find the meat itself doesn't have much flavor if you choose to eat the naked side, but the texture and the sauce make up for it I suppose.The sauce itself is quite flavorful, somewhat sweet somewhat salty. Definitely lots of things going into their sauce.If you order the combo, they provide unlimited miso soup, cabbage, and rice if you like to eat at a balanced rate.Some people might not like the idea of having all that sauce all over the meat cause it loses its crisp, but it wasn't that big of a deal to me.

Katsu itself is great!!! - thick piece of CRISPY tender pork which 100% will have you taking home a good 33% of the cutlet.

These croquettes were cheesy and so much flavour inside.The udon carbonara was innovative. The udon was well done. But their carbonara sauce was very  heavy.We had the original tonkatsu and cheese stuffed tonkatsu. Your first grind sesame in a mortar for the tonkatsu bbq sauce. I wish there were more sesame seeds. The pork were tender and juicy and the fried panko was crispy. The portion was huge! I think I only finished a third of the pork loin.

Katsuya,"I had lunch here today with a couple of friends, arriving shortly before noon. The restaurant was empty, so we pretty much had a choice of tables. I'm not a fan of stools, so we took a lower table on the left side of the restaurant. Our server immediately brought over a bottle of water with cups, but couldn't be bothered to pour for us. No biggie. After browsing the menu, we decided to share a couple of appies and a selection of mains to share. We chose the udon carbonara, cheese & crab meat croquettes and 3 of the tonkastsu dishes: curry, white snow and traditional. I really loved how crispy the coating was on the croquettes as well as the pork. Very light taste, not greasy at all. The croquettes were super cheesy and creamy, with a nice crab flavour. But I think my favourite dish was the carbonara udon. I'd definitely order this again.",4.0,4.0,214,2017-10-02,43.789922,-79.41846,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Katsuya,"My wife and I had a great experience here. We waited for 4 tables before being seated. It's a small open kitchen setting. We ordered the Curry Chicken Katsu and Chili Garlic Pork with one cheese. Both were very juicy and huge portions of meat. Rice, salad and miso soup are free refills.  The fried batter is light and we especially love how fluffy the chicken was. We were blown away by the attentive service of their wait staff. We accidentally dropped some napkins and one waiter quickly picked up new napkins for us as he brought food out. We had a small mix when the curry chicken was served with pork instead. They offered to give us a new serving of chicken and let us keep the pork. The waiter apologized and checked in on us a while later. Service makes everything better! We will be recommending this place to our friends.",4.0,5.0,214,2017-12-28,43.789922,-79.41846,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"

Katsuya,"I love katsu so I was excited to come to Katsuya to try out. The restaurant has nice looking decor, there are only however 3 parking spots that are a bit tight, if the place is any busier you'll probably have to park on a nearby street.An order of katsu is around $12-15, and they come with a variety of sauces. I had a normal pork katsu with curry and my gf had the pork katsu stuffed with cheese and a fruit based sauce - which is like an okonomiyaki sauce.The pork chops are very crispy and tender, however I found the breading slightly unauthentic, the panko that was used seems a bit thinner and lighter than what I normally have eaten in the past. Curry is just normal, it tastes like a typical Japanese curry that you can buy at a supermarket. The one with cheese appears to be a very thin pork chop wrapped around a huge piece of cheese and then fried. This one felt a bit of an overload, the portion feels like it can be shared with 2 people! While cheese is nice I think it was a bit too much. The sauce was slightly bland, could've been a bit more spiced and flavourful, it would bring out the dish a bit more if the sauce was better. I wouldn't order the one with cheese again.There's also unlimited soup, rice and cabbage, so it can fill you up if you need extras!",4.0,3.0,214,2017-10-16,43.789922,-79.41846,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Katsuya,"I truly enjoyed katsuya and their Tonkatsu. Both the pork and the chicken option were soft and light and not overpowered by the crispy batter. Their sauces were flavourful and each had its own unique taste.The curry was reminiscent of those in Japan (although still can't compare, its decent if we compare it to other Japanese places that serves curry in the GTA). Paired well with the Katsu for sure. Got the pork tenderloin so that might've given it a kick as it's the more expensive option of out the other parts of the pig.The carbonara was tasty as well. A little heavy with the cream but they also added Chili flakes to give it a kick. Different experience but a nice one.Their takoyaki was different and their wings weren't the best. Both used their Katsu batter which took away the authenticity of the actual dish. Wings were also hard.Overall great flavours, crispy and light tonkatsu.

Katsuya,"Pros:Very well done KatsuKatsu portions are greatCons:On the pricey sideAre you a fan of Katsu?  If you answered yes. than Katsuya should definitely be on your radar.  Fans of this Japanese comfort food will definitely enjoy a meal here.  We came here with our youngest daughter.  Katsuya is not the most kid friendly.  There are 3 tables on the side that have a padded bench.  You are limited to those tables if you have small children.  The place isn't too big overall so any group larger than 4 could have a tough time finding a table.We ordered the Katsuya original and I've forgotten the name of the second one but it's basically like a takoyaki flavour one.  Both were pork tenderloin katsu. An order of curry chicken karaage was also ordered.  When it comes to the Katsu, you get an enormous piece per order.  It's one of the biggest I've ever seen at a restaurant.  The katsu was also super tender.  One of the best I've ever had.  I wished they gave you more rice though.  They give you suck a small amount for the size of katsu you get.  Still, it was hard to get mad because the katsu was so good.  The karaage was pretty good too.  It had a hint of curry but it wasn't spicy at all.  That was perfect for my eldest daughter when we brought some home for her.The only gripe is the price.  You're going to be paying about $15 bucks for the katsu,  The little amount of rice and shredded cabbage you get don't help either.  It's a little steep for Katsu, albeit a very good one.If you love Katsu, i highly recommend you come here.

Katsuya,"Located close to Yonge and Cummer Katsuya is a Japanese restaurant that's serving some great Katsu set dishes.  Their menu features different types of Katsu (cutlets) are served rice, salad and various sauces.  From stuffed cheese katsu to a spicy garlic sauce or if you're feeling for a traditional katsu, they've got it all. If you order a Katsu set menu it comes with rice and it includes unlimited miso soup and refreshing cabbage salad.  In terms of ambiance the place is clean, presentable and their service is friendly. Average price of a katsu set was between $11-$15.For food Jen ordered their traditional Japanse Katsu stuffed with Cheese which was delicious.  This came with a sesame seed sauce used to compliment the cutlet.As for me, I ordered their chili garlic katsu.  Covered with thinly sliced fried garlic mixed with a spicy sauce on the side, this condimient was packed with flavor. Overall, coming here for the first time this place didn't disappoint me. Food, service, presentation, cleanliness and prices all scored well for me.

Si Lom Thai Bistro,"I have been going to the same Thai restaurants in Toronto (eg Pai, Sabai Sabai, Thai Basil) and decided to try something new.. and boy was I pleasantly surprised! I ordered the Panang chicken and my friend ordered the beef Khao Soi. The flavours of both dishes were phenomenal. The menu says the Panang curry is spicy but I felt it was pretty mild (considering that I do not take heat well). We ordered the ice cream dessert dish that they had and we did not feel that it was worth the price. We also tried the dark roast Thai ice tea which tasted like grass jelly... if you're looking for the flavours of a traditional Thai ice tea I would not suggest it. Only half their tables were filled on a Wednesday night --I prefer this because it allowed for conversation to take place at a comfortable noise level.

Si Lom Thai Bistro,"I came Sunday dinner, there was no wait or reservations required. We tried the soft shell crab pad Thai, medium spicy. I liked how it came with mangos. The edible crab shell is very interesting to try, it's fried similar to crab tempura! I can handle spicy foods and my favorite spice level is usually medium at most Asian establishments. I stayed on the safe side and ordered medium since as some reviews said Thai spicy was REALLY spicy. Medium turned out to be not spicy at all, I could not taste ANY spiciness. Overall it was a lot of food and I ended up taking half of it to go, for leftovers the day after. I felt like the noodles to other ingredients ratio was really high, but it's the same issue I've noticed with other pad Thai places.

Lovely crowd, friendly servers, and lively atmosphere make the wait for a table bearable.

It's also as tasty as it sounds (4/5)Pork Krapow - their basil stir fried pork is crispy and aromatic and spicy and delicious. This is tied with the pad Thai for my fave dish of the night (5/5)We waited maybe 40/50 minutes for our food.

Si Lom Thai Bistro,"This is a wonderful and authentic small place located in pride village! The waiters converse among themselves in Thai, and are very welcoming and friendly. The food is also amazing!My friends ordered the soft shell crab and vegan pad thai, along with a drink called the lemonade blue pea tea. The drink came first, and we were so amused by it! Essentially, the blue colour of the drink turns a lovely lavender hue once you add the tonic/soda. The chemical reaction is absolutely fascinating.The pad thai were also very yummy and not too oily or greasy at all. Surprisingly, the vegan one tasted almost exactly the same as the soft shell crab one, with the exception that it didn't come with mangoes. Both had generous portions of peanuts, bean sprouts, noodles, and chives. The soft shell crab was finger licking good!!! It was fried perfectly and extremely flavourful.I got the papaya salad with a side of sticky rice, and enjoyed it... At the beginning. I ordered medium spicy (apparently medium spice has one whole chili pepper!), and it became too spicy for me to handle. Eventually, my tongue began to burn and swell, and then it gradually moved up to my lips. My eyes started to tear up, and then my nose began to run... How unsightly.The flavour of the salad was great, being both tangy and spicy. My main complaint (apart from it being too spicy, but that is my fault completely for not ordering mild spicy) was that there were very few peanuts, despite the advertising/menu description. The sticky rice was far too hard, and became an unpliable piece of food by the end of my meal.Customer service, however, is A+. Will definitely come again to try more items (please don't judge me on the salad, I wasn't feeling much of an appetite).",4.0,4.0,55,2017-11-26,43.665007,-79.380811,Thai

The chicken pad thai and the vegan pad thai are both good (although IMO Pai is better, there's nothing as good as this near Yonge and Bloor), and I really like the red curry shrimp.The curries can be VERY spicy, though.

There is a small patio which was full for dinner on a Sunday evening so we sat inside. We ordered the soft shell crab pad thai and the chicken panang curry with the tea bucket #2. The pad thai was excellent, panag was just as good. I thought it was weird they didn't ask for spice level. The pad thai was not spicy at all and the curry was very mild. The drink bucket was worth getting but don't expect it to get you even buzzed. There is also a yelp check-in promotion here for a free daily special drink which when I went was some type of special chrysanthemum tasting sweet iced tea.

Si Lom Thai Bistro,"I came here with my friend spontaneously on Halloween! It was fun to see the servers with painted skull faces. The space of the restaurant is a bit small (me and the guy behind me were practically back to back). The cozy decor really set the atmosphere and I also loved the LIT music playing in the background. The servers are really efficient and friendly as well!I needed something to wake me up so I ordered the Lemongrass Juice Tea ($4.50). It was refreshing and did its job in keeping me awake. It had a cute hand decoration which I appreciated but its a shame that I didn't have a photo. Soft Shell Crab Pad Thai ($22) had a smaller portion than I expected which is fine if the quality makes up for it. The taste was great, pack of flavours and interesting ingredients like shredded mango! It was also my first time having a full soft crab so I can't comment on the quality of the crab but I don't feel like it should of been a part of the pad thai. It had its own separate flavours and textures that would of been better on its own. There was no distinct taste of crab in the pad thai itself. I think in the future, getting a regular pad thai would of been more worth it! We finished off with the Black Bean Coconut Sticky Rice ($7) as a dessert. The sticky rice worked well with the coconut milk! It was delicious except it was a bit too sweet for me.

Seriously fast. I got the chicken pad kraprow (called ""gra prow"" at some other places) which was very good.Came with two small veggie spring rolls which was a nice surprise. Kind of didn't like paying an extra $1.50 for the fried egg (it's an essential part of the dish, isn't it?) but total price of $13 tax in is A-OK so no real complaints here.

I first ordered the Si Lom Road to share, which was a pretty light and delicious drink. My friend  then decided to order the Jolly Bear & Friends Kamikaze. It honestly tasted quite similar to Si Lom Road, minus the gummy bears. I don't suggest ordering both at the same time because it's like buying the same drink twice.For my meal, I ordered the Pad Thai Chicken dish and loved it!

Since I'm from Thailand, I have extremely high standards when it comes to Thai food, and not many places seem to fit the bill. I came here for my brother's birthday lunch and we ordered a ton of food to share. We started off with the Som Tam with Salted Eggs, the Ocean Wings and the Nam Tok with Pork Jowl. Flavours are completely on-point here! I would order all three dishes again. We also ordered the Leng Tom Zab, which is a Thai Spicy Pork Bone Soup. Trust me when I say this is as tasty and spicy as the ones we used to eat in Thailand. They don't dumb down the spice levels here at all, which I truly appreciated.

The Pad Thai with Soft Shell Crab wasn't my favourite; I felt it was a bit sweet for my tastes, but I appreciated the huge soft shell crab that comes in this dish. The Khao Soi was super yummy, but I prefer the noodles that they serve with the Khao Soi over at Sukhothai. I also prefer Sukhothai's curry sauce, but that's just a matter of personal preference.

Recommend ordering the guacamole, the chips are very delicious.I came here with a group of 8, we ordered a variety of dishes and everyone enjoyed it.

Cocina Economica,"Given the area of where this resturant is located, it sure is a hidden gem. My boyfriend and I came into the spot on a Monday night to where it looked packed from what we saw through the window, once we got in, we saw that it was rather small - lucky for us we were able to get a table. The interior and ambiance set a nice cozy vibe as we sat down and felt as if we weren't even in corktown. The servers were super nice to explain the menu, make reccomendations in asking us what sorts of flavors we enjoy in order to point out what would satisfy our pallets that night.We ended up sharing guac and chips as our starter; which came with delicious house made chips, as well as the chivice; which we both devoured in an instant! We also decided on getting the carnitas as our main, which were delicious and came with fresh made flour tortillas along with house made salsas, and chili oils that we got to add on to spice up our tacos - I rather enjoined the concept of building our own tacos with the various toppings that were given, so that both my bf and I could alter our spice preferences! This place is definitely a spot to come with a goid group of friends as the dishes are meant to be shared with it being a tapas styled resturant. Will most likely be looking into visiting this place again.",4.0,3.0,121,2017-11-14,43.654927,-79.365475,Mexican
Cocina Economica,"Wow this is an amazing place for Mexican food! It's very small and cute, with seating both indoors and outdoors. Everything was super delicious. They have appetizers, and the main dishes are mostly tacos. They serve the dish, rice and beans, and tortillas separately so you can make your own taco. I really liked the chicken one, with the taste of sour tomatoes in the sauce. The tres leches in desert section is my absolutely favorite! The whipped cream topping is fluffy and not sweet. It goes perfectly with the condensed milk soaked cake. I absolutely recommend this place if you feel like some Mexican food!",4.0,5.0,121,2017-05-15,43.654927,-79.365475,Mexican
Cocina Economica,"I recently took my dad here for lunch. It was a busy day in this tiny restaurant. Almost all of the tables were full. But there were a couple open... I called to see if there was space, they insisted we sit at the bar. The food was okay... I had a Mexican roommate in the past who was a excellent cook. We had the ceviche- needed lots of salt, lime juice and more curing time. We also had some sort of stuffed pepper it was decent, I might get it again if I went. We also had the beef dish. It was tender but not very exciting. That being said, my dad liked it the most out of all of the dishes we had.The Service.... yikes!!! Since we were at the bar/ work station we could talk directly to the staff for most of our visit, which I believe was there saving grace... because it took a while for things to come & they seemed frazzled. Would I come back?! Maybe if I wasn't paying! PS they kept on repeating that this was an authentic Mexican restaurant...

Cocina Economica,"My friends and I had to attend an event at the Berkeley street church on Thursday night so we decided to eat our dinner here before the event. It was my second time here and first time for two of my friends. Food and dessert were great - nothing has changed since the last time I was here. Service is pretty bad though. We were ready to order in about 10 minutes after we were seated but no one came to ask us if we were ready. Couple servers passed us back and forth but it wasn't until I had to raise my hand and flag someone down when we placed our order. They charged us for something we didn't order and we felt rushed to pay the bills while we were waiting for a dessert. I completely understand the time limits on reservations and the need to clear the table for next group, but we would not have felt like we were disrespecting the time if the service was more prompt, timely and error free.

Cocina Economica,"Great Mexican restaurant located around Corktown. Given it's location, it is probably less known compared to city favs like La Carnita. Cocina Economica is a part of the Playa Cabana group and there are some similarities to its sister restaurants.We ordered multiple items from their menu and tried a few of their cocktails. The ceviche dish was the largest I have ever encountered in Toronto. The ratio of shrimp and scallop to tostada was almost too high. Overall, the dish was fresh and tangy (lime). The Carne Asada was fantastic. The meat fell off the bone and was covered in a delicious sauce.To top it off, their cocktails were strong and very well prepared.",4.0,5.0,121,2017-06-08,43.654927,-79.365475,Mexican

Got the Al Pastor which was pork leg with pineapple - delish! the pineapple really makes it, its sweet and savory. The Res in Salsa Verde - braised beef with tomatillo also amazing! The beef was soft, like a stew, it felt hearty and homey. Everything also comes with rice, beans and corn tortillas (in a basket to keep them warm!) to make your own tacos. Each table also gets a variety of salsa with a tostada to dip. The portions are large and I leave extremely full after.

Cocina Economica,"2.5 - I do like the decor! Decor is Busy, detailed and rustic looking, transports you elsewhere. Friendly staff.Interesting concept when they describe it but really its just make your own tacos. Tastey but nothing really stood out to me. Weird how they give you such minimal amounts of rice and beans. Nice soft taco but I rather have the dish (I had the shrimp and my bf had the lamb) with just the sauce mixed with rice and beans. We did ask for more rice. Minimal cilantro. A bit confused when they brought out the hard tacos and hot sauces. Was it an app or was it to go with our dish? We did both. Since it is make your own tacos we had sooo many dishes on the table. The tables are super duper small - we had to put some dishes and the water bottle on other surrounding tables (I cannot imagine where to put stuff if the resto was packed). A bit more $ than you expect to DIY your own tacos, unless you like paying for that experience.",4.0,3.0,121,2017-09-06,43.654927,-79.365475,Mexican

My boyfriend ordered the res en salsa Verde,  a flavourful,  moist,  and unique blend that we loved.  My carnitas however lacked a certain tear apart quality that you usually get with carnitas.  They were still delicious,  it's really hard to mess up pork belly.  I appreciated the 'make your own taco'  style of dining.  Makes it a little more fun than just getting some made Tacos on a plate and eating in silence. The sauces and hot sauces were great; reminded me of my families style.

Cocina Economica,"I came here once for lunch and had my rehearsal dinner here because it was close to my wedding venue.For the rehearsal dinner, I had 13 people and the staff gave us the entire upstairs of the house. The upstairs had bar stools and small tables around, but did not have one table that fit 13 people. At first, we wanted to put all the tables together so we could all sit together, but the server recommended that they serve the food on a table and instead of sitting together, we can grab plates and mingle around. At first, I didn't like the idea because I felt everyone would be separated, but then I was super glad we did it because we got to mingle around and talk to people at our own pace as opposed to being restricted at the large table. It's a great place to have a small party for sure. We ordered everything on the menu and everything tasted was amazing! The food is authentic Mexican, but with a street style twist. We even had left overs that they packed up for us! The drinks are done with a strong hand, which I loved! All our guests had fun and enjoyed the chill atmosphere and food before our big day.

Moliceiro Restaurant,"The name means a traditional sort of Portuguese riverboat. It is a reflection of the atmosphere and food that is found in this restaurant. (A little out of place with the chi-chi other restaurants surrounding it, but actually probably more worthwhile!)The wine list is inexpensive, full of interesting Portuguese wines that one would otherwise not normally sample. (If you want to bring your own there is a $15 corkage). We had an Allo Albarino which was delicious, minerally and fresh, rather like a rich Vino Verde.We were given some fat thick olives and some good bread which was cold but otherwise fine.Our octopus was hot, great, on a bed of pickled onion, very soft and tender, and plenty of it. ""It is one of the signature dishes of the restaurant"".The Greek salad was standard, lots of crisp lettuce but rather light on the other ingredients.Our sea bream was on a bed of garlic and beautifully cooked but not deboned ; plenty enough to share for two.

Moliceiro Restaurant,"I have never been to a Portuguese restaurant before. My best friend is Portuguese so she makes lots of yummy food for me that I don't have to go out to eat. My aunts craved for Portuguese food so I used Yelp to assist me.  We decided on Moliceiro located in Ossington where all the amazing restaurants are located.  Yelp gave it a great rating so we decided to try it.  There's paid meter parking outside of the restaurant.  It was freezing and luckily I got a spot right in front of the restaurant.  It's wasn't packed on a Saturday night initially.  I was thinking it was because of the cold. But an hour later the place was packed. The restaurant is not too big.  We ordered their house Portuguese red wine, amazing wine. For the appetizer we ordered the clams with white wine garlic sauce.  That seems to be quite popular since throughout the night a majority of the tables ordered that appetizer. It was so good. We also got the Portuguese sausages in tomato sauce.  We  had some fresh bread and olives to start.  Since we ordered so many appetizers and the server told us the portions are large we settled on 2 main entrees to share between 3 of us. We got the octopus which is to die for. So good. Also got the jumbo shrimps with olive oil and peri peri sauce and fettuccine. It's a bit on the spicy side but we loved it. We were planning to get 2 desserts to share but they were out of tiramisu so we got the flan custard.  Amazing.  All in all a great meal.  The service was great.

Moliceiro Restaurant,So that was a nice random pleasant surprise. I'm not sure what I was doing on Yelp when this restaurant showed up. Husband and I are almost always down some Portuguese food since there's always enough grilled meats and fish options. We've been to another few spots before but flavour wise I enjoyed this the best.For starters we got the grilled calamari and  cod cakes which i found light fluffy and delicious. Husband found a few bones in his though. The calamari was unique served with black eyed beans and onions and pretty large portion size. For mains  we shared soft succulent lamb chops and a very unique pasta with Chipotle sauce and chicken. Can't say I've ever seen that anywhere before and it was tempting enough for me to break my low carb diet rule. Well worth it! Though we weren't initially going to order dessert cuz the portion size were so generous for mains but I'm so glad we decided to get the tiramisu !! Delicious. Topped the great meal with an espresso and voila! Will be back someday to try their other dishes. The owner came out to check on tables which was really nice. Great people good food .

They pair it with a lightly sauced slaw which complements it well. They no longer serve ice cream sandwiches for dessert which was a bummer, but we were pretty stuffed! All that and our bill only came to $40 each.The owners, two sisters, are also the bartenders and servers; although the place is small we found they needed at least one more server to keep up. Also, as we were only a table for two, they put us by the door which kept opening and closing and made us a bit chilly.

I had to say the name sort of threw me when I was told to meet there because it almost sounded like my friend was saying goodnight. I'll Be Seeing You (capitalized as it's a proper name) is on the south side of Queen East just about a block east of Broadview. There's a sign on the door about the place being started by two sisters and one dollar. I'd love to sit and learn the story behind the place. Sadly we only came to have a quick drink however in the short time spent in this local watering hole it was pretty evident that this place has charm in buckets.  While the bar looked rather generously stocked the decor definitely had a female touch.  The most obvious display of that would be the really cool display of plates on the back wall. I've never seen something like that in a bar which makes this idea rather unique. Besides that the two sisters (I'm assuming they were the two serving us) were extremely friendly and accommodating. It always feels good when you feel welcomed in a place especially if it's your first time at a there. The vibe was good and although it would have been nice to stay we had to meet others elsewhere. We did however attempt to come back after we were done with dinner but unfortunately the place didn't have room at that time which on a Friday is understandable.

I can't really speak to the rest of the alcohol menu as we are primarily beer drinkers.Food:The food was quite tasty. I had the potato wedges with bacon, sour cream, cheese and scallions. It was basically a whole potato sliced into wedges and covered with SO much stuff. I couldn't even finish them, to be honest. My fiancé had the meatballs which were delicious and followed those up with the jalapeno poppers which he said were quite good as well. The wings come with a basting brush so you can make them as saucy as you want.Service:Our server was great! Prompt, friendly, and managed to keep the bills of 12 people straight without any mix ups.Atmosphere:Super cute! The walls are plastered with eclectic photos and pieces of art, there's a super comfy old school vintage sofa, and a good selection of board games (Cards Against Humanity, Headbanz, Scrabble, Balderdash, to name a few) which were all in great shape and not missing any pieces, as far as I know.Overall this place is quite a Leslieville gem and I would recommend it to everyone!",4.0,5.0,24,2017-08-14,43.658993,-79.348074,"Cocktail Bars , Comfort Food"

I’ll Be Seeing You,"Perfect place for a girls night. This cute and homey bar is owned by two super cool looking sisters. I immediately give props to them as they both work on the floor six days of the week. The bar includes a mix of vintage furniture, modern drinks, comfort food menu - there's definitely something for everyone. They also have a stack of old school board games available to play.  We ordered the Ceasar salad, wings and Mac and cheese. I assumed the plates would be appetizer size but boy we're we wrong. The Ceasar salad was serving plate size and it was decent. The Mac and cheese came in a hot cast iron skillet. While the skillet looked small, that skillet was 2-3 inches deep. The macaroni could have been a little bit softer but that's more a personal preference, this was more al dente. The cheese was gooey, creamy and was a nice homemade dish. Now the wings... These are the best wings. They are baked but these taste fried so if you're worried about a lack of crunchy breading, no need to worry. The best part of the wings are the sauces! We got BBQ and Honey I'm Hot and it was a perfect blend of heat and sweetness. The coleslaw that came with the wings was really good as well. This is a great place to grab drinks with the girls and enjoy some shareable bites.

Khao San Road,"This is place is super tasty! It was busy so be prepared to wait, if you're solo you should get a bar spot right faster.A word of warning though, if you don't do spicy go mild. Medium was too hot, this place does traditional Thai spice. The food was excellent but a little different than I remember in Thailand, which doesn't mean it's not good but it was different. I ordered the Massaman curry which was more tamarind than I expected; however, it still tasted great. And just for a throw back I ordered a Singha. There were so many things I wanted to try, it's too bad there wasn't a tasting menu.I'd definitely go back and try a few more things.

Khao San Road,"Honestly, I went here a couple of months ago, and totally forgot to put my review- but forgot because of how i memorable it was.My lovely boyfriend brought me here because he heard great reviews about it, and I feel bad ranking it so low because he planned it and everything but you know, shit happens lolFirst off, I know this isn't a place for wifi, but I thought I asked for it anyways because I always do (2 gb limit you know) and I had seen my waiter talk to another waitress (probably manager) about it and clearly there was wifi but she just gave me a look with attitude and told my waiter to tell me no. After this incident she just did not give me a welcoming vibe throughout the entire service. But that's besides the point. I ordered the beef/pork and rice and my boyfriend ordered the pad Thai and both dishes were very underwhelming and worst of all, both dishes were SO spicy that I felt miserable eating it. Every spoonful I had to wash down with water- really felt as if they dumped a whole load of red pepper on it. Didn't even bother to ask for another one because it was so busy and didn't want to wait again so I just sucked it up and ate what was not worth our money. Honestly did not taste like Thai food at all and let's just say I never returned again.

Khao San Road,"Great spot for date night and we came after a spa day. Happening place with your typical downtown crowd and loud music. Service and food was good too. We had the Khao Soi and it was very delicious HOWEVER, having been to Lotus of Siam in LV, this place did not compare. The soup in the Khao Soi was very creamy and tasty, noodles were perfectly cooked and it was a fun vibe. The place is filled with 25+ something type crowd and great music.Good thing I'm all about making reservations! Definitely do this or you'll be waiting a while and there isn't a great space for those who have to wait.Personally, we've got some great Thai spots in Richmond Hill so I wouldn't make the trek for this place again.

Khao San Road,"KSR and Pai are extremely popular establishments in the DT core. I visited the old KSR on several occasions and remember the food/atmosphere very well. It was my first visit since they moved and I didn't quite enjoy myself like I thought I would. They definitely upped the hipster vibe, that's for sure. Me thinks the entrance used to be at the front but they locked it and guests now have to go around the corner in the alley, walk into a stairwell before entering through the back? The atmosphere is still bumpin' but there is certainly something missing. They had ONE server on the floor during the lunch rush. My party ordered within 5 minutes of sitting down and it legit took 45 minutes for the food to arrive. It seemed as though they were very busy handling take-out orders (Ritual, Mealpal, Foodora, UberEats, etc.) Food was aite but it ain't what it used to be. Ordered the Khao Soi + chicken and there was barely any meat. Tons of curry soup leftover. Portions are small and for that price I'd rather go try other Thai places in the vicinity.

Khao San Road,"To start with, I don't know where  bad reviews come from. I love Thai food and I have had my fair share of Thai food in Toronto. I have to say the Three Flavor Pad Thai (9/10) I had at Khao San Road is the best I've had in town! It has a very balanced taste of sour, salty, and bit sweetness. We also ordered fresh rolls and fried chicken. Both dishes were really delicious and had good presentation. Their dipping sauces tasted different from other places. They are so yummy you just wanna keep eating them!I was there in a busy night, but the food came 5 mins after we put in our order. I was very pleased with that too! One thing wasn't 8 out of 10 is the Thai Ice Tea (7/10). I found ice tea here is a bit too sweet, maybe too much condense milk?Khao San Road doesn't take reservation.

Khao San Road,"I went to Khao San Road some years ago at their old location. The internet raved about how pretty the new location is so I decided to check it out. I went on a weeknight and was a bit disappointed that you weren't allowed to be seated until everyone from your party was there (not sure if this was the case for their previous location as well). I had to wait on the second floor in the meantime. By the time I could be seated, all of the individual tables were filled up and I was seated at one of the communal tables on the first floor.If you're seated at a communal table, there are hooks under the table for you to hang your bag and coat (though they are quite low if you have a longer jacket). The chairs for the communal tables are also high without a back rest, so there might be difficulty finding a place to hang your jacket during the winter time. They have more seating on the second floor (that can be booked out for events), which also has a bar.I had the Pad Gra Prao and it came out as expected, vegetables with fried pork over a fried egg and rice. Prices are $15.50 or $16 for their main dishes. Khao San Road is comparable in terms of menu and cost to Pai, which is just down the road.

Khao San Road,"Anyone who knows me knows I love Thai food! I have tried Thai food from various restaurants around Toronto and just had to try this restaurant out before leaving Toronto. My husband and I reached here early evening, just before 7pm and it was jam packed. There was a line up to get a table so we put our names on the list and headed upstairs for drinks while we waited. We waited for about 30 min before we got a call that our table was ready. We we're seated at a sharing table where 2-3 other groups were sitting already. After going through the menu we decided to order the zucchini fritters as a starter and follow that with three flavours pad thai and pad phed pha red curry. The food was absolutely amazing. The flavours of the dishes was pure perfection. Only downside is that all dishes were extremely heavy. However, we just packed up the leftovers and had it for lunch the next day. The restaurant is pretty small with nice decor. Bathrooms were not that impressive and need to be maintained better. The idea of sitting at a shared table is nice. We actually talked to the couple sitting right next to us and shared our food experiences, which was very nice. Another downside is that with the restaurant being so crowded, we did have problems getting hold of our server for the bill and ended up waiting for quite a while.

Khao San Road,"Probably one of my favorite places in Toronto for Thai food... If not my favorite. I remember the first time I went to Khao San Road years ago (when it was at the previous location), I told them to make it actual **spicy**, not North American spicy. That was a mistake. I tapped the table and cried mercy. (For what it's worth, I can eat very spicy food). But ever since then, I've toned it down, ordered food like normal people would and it tastes so very good!Several things I really like about it here. It's bright! Most of the seats are communal, so you get plopped wherever without having to wait too long. There service is also fast as well, so it's not like we'd have to order and wait forever before we can eat.Oh yeah, and the food has really clean and fresh tastes to it. The problem are pretty big. We were commenting that maybe next time instead of doing one entree and two mains, we could swap and get two entrees and one main... (To be honest, we didn't finish our 1 entree or any of our mains, so maybe 2 entrees is too large too). But the entree came pretty quickly, and we had plenty to nibble on until the mains came. We didn't wait forever for our drinks either. Their Thai ice tea was really good, as was the mango juice. We felt the food was reasonably priced. We saw some notice about prices and minimum wages etc on their walls, but I didn't really process what the message was. I just hope they're able to keep prices and services the same here.",4.0,5.0,1287,2017-12-10,43.646411,-79.39348,Thai

Khao San Road,"Wanted to be treated like garbage?Want to get kicked out after paying your bill?If so, Khao San Road is the place for you.I took my date to Khao San Road after seeing high number of reviews on Yelp. As soon as I sat down, I was embarrassed that I took her here. I saw the owner of the restaurant eating food with his bare hands between serving food to customers. It was disgusting. The food portion was very small and the service was the worst. The small portion kind of helped because it was really bad. It was insanely salty. I was thinking that this was really bad for my health. (I remember chugging down water all day after leaving Khao San Road). I always finish my food. In fact I always order second bowl of rice when having curry. (Curry lovers know what I'm talking about). I could not finish my curry. It was that bad.When it was time for me to pay the tip, I gave them what they deserved. I paid the bill. The owner then came upto me and demanded that I should be paying more tip. I refused as it was ""tip"" and I get to decide how much tip I should be giving them. He then kicked me out of the restaurant. It was freezing outside but I had no choice. He then told one of his employees to stay outside to watch me. He kicked me out and found a way to harass me even after I was outside.I had to go to the washroom after my meal, but I couldn't. My date was still in the washroom when I got kicked out. They would not let me wait for my date inside. She was very curious why I was waiting for her outside when it was freezing.This place has unusual amount of reviews even for a well-known restaurant in downtown Toronto.

Khao San Road,"Unimpressed. This restaurant is one of the known places in downtown Toronto for Thai food but I feel like its been overrated. Food here is decent but not the best. I was expecting more from such a high rated restaurant. Customer Service is horrible. You'll spend most of your time waiting for the bill...I've tried the 3 flavour pad Thai with beef here. The pad Thai was extremely sweet. They overdosed on too much sauce. The beef was really tough. It smelt really good but flavour wise the flavour was not much different from any other Thai place. I also tried the red curry here. I'm not sure if the curry was supposed to be that watery. But it was like liquid. I just expected the consistency to be a little thicker like other places. Flavour wasn't as strong either and a little on the sweeter side. There was little chicken and it was dry. As for the rice, the rice was undercooked and really hard even when you soak it in the curry.  Lastly, the Thai iced tea is really good. The drink was thick and strong. Full of tea flavour. Note: if you order the drink with no ice, they give you a smaller cup. Overall, food was not worth the wait. Decent but could do better. As for customer service it is horrible. Waiting for a table took a while, then waiting for food, then waiting for the bill. The bill took like 20 minutes to come. I had my credit card out and ready to pay already and the waiter just gives me the bill and walks away to do other stuff. She could clearly tell I was ready to pay too.... like really? I was standing up, all packed and everything too. Didn't cash me out until another 10 minutes. Now I see why there's always a wait. Because the waiters drag time when cashing out the bills.P.S. There's a bar upstairs while you wait. They serve different appetizers and drinks. We tried the skewer, they were delicious. The pork skewer, the meat was tender and juicy. The chicken skewers was not overcooked and also really juicy and flavourful. This apparently was made by a different chef.

Massaman Curry - A sweet curry with round ball potatoes and peanuts.Tried both the Bangkok and Three Flavours Pad Thai - Medium spice level was not spicy at all. Generally quite sweet.

It's like eating squash chips! Crunchy and tasty, but not sure it was worth the price.Three flavors Pad Thai with chicken ($15.5)Not sure how this was different than the bangkok-style pad thai.

Khao San Road,"After making the mandatory pilgrimages to Suko Thai on Parliament and PAI, and experiencing the awesomeness that your taste buds get treated to at these otherworldly Thai spots, I had the bar set high for Khao San Rd. I'd heard about the line ups and the massive crowds this place drew and was expecting the worst of that as I approached the gates of this trendy downtown spot. Turned out, it was all for not. I got seated right away by a super friendly hostess who asked if I minded to share a table, which I was okay with.I ordered the three flavors Pad Thai with chicken, two chillier of spice. First let me say that I am not much of a spice guy, but I'd heard it is good for your health so I went with the standard and it was perfect, just the right amount of fire. Seeing as I really don't usually like spice, that's saying they found the bliss point perfectly. My accompaniment was a glass of mango juice, which for $3.50 and arriving in a giant glass, was what I'd consider good value.I have only one bone of contention with Khao San Rd., and it's their rolls. To be clear, I didn't order them. I was considering it, but when I saw the price, I couldn't justify it. I am not someone who minds spending on food, and the rolls might be as otherworldly as the Pad Thai is, but $10?? No spring rolls should ever cost that much. They may be great, but they can't be $10. Getting back to the positives, the atmosphere is fantastic too. They were playing some hip hop in the background, but not so loud that it distracted you from the food. The tables and chairs are comfy and at a good level so you don't feel like you're in a high chair, and the staff is very pleasant.Great, and I'll be back!",4.0,4.0,1287,2017-08-19,43.646411,-79.39348,Thai
Khao San Road,"Khao San Road is back and has moved into a shiny new glass box. Fortunately, it's menu remains the same and retains all of the items that made it a foodie legend in the past. This new joint also recaptures the noisy and electric atmosphere of the original. The communal seating returns along with the blaring speakers. The long wait times, however, are still a norm here. Make sure to show up with your full party or the host will not seat you. The number one reason to eat here, in my opinion, is their signature Three Flavours Pad Thai. Probably the best pad thai in Toronto, this dish comes perfectly drenched in sauce that is tangy and sweet and oh so delicious. The Bangkok style pad thai is more ordinary in flavour and just not as amazing, Imo. Stick to the three flavour one =) Their other dishes, however, are equally impressive and satisfying. The Crispy Rice Salad is another signature dish they serve here that leaves a lasting impression. Be warned though, it is more filling than it looks and can work a number on your jaws (really crunchy). I would recommend splitting this app with 4 people even. If there's one dish I wouldn't recommend, however, it would probably be the Khao Soi. Not that it's a bad dish, it just pales in comparison to the one at Pai (not as creamy and delicious). Otherwise, I think you really can't go wrong with their menu!",4.0,5.0,1287,2017-07-11,43.646411,-79.39348,Thai
Khao San Road,"OMG, I waited so long to go to Khao San Road!  I never got to go to their old location, and my girlfriend was raving about how the food was sooo good, just like the one she had in Bangkok and Phuket (I've never been to Thailand). Well, we went.  No line up for two people (larger groups would probably have to wait as the seating is cafeteria style).  I saw that they had two Pad Thais and asked the girl who was bussing the tables what is the difference (she was the closest by) and she retorted: read the ingredients, you will figure it out.  Really? OK.I had the Bangkok Pad Thai, and my girlfriend had Pad Gra Prao, and we shared a garlic shrip appetizer.  Unfortunately, the appetizer was the best dish.  My girlfriend had the Tom Yum soup and she wasn't impressed - didn't taste like in Thailand, no lemmongrass and different flavor. The Bangkok Pad Thai was overly salty and soaked in fish sauce which drowned any other taste.  Despite claims of ""The best Pad Thai in Toronto"" - this was one of the worse ones (I love Pad Thai and have it in every Thai restaurant I go).  Mediocre, at best. I tried my girlfriend's Pad Gra Prao - it seems like the cook dumped an entire salt shaker in it - so salty to be almost inedible.  Drank a gallon of water afterwards.  Otherwise the texture was ok.So, there, I went to Khao San Road and will never return again.  So many better Thai places in Toronto and in the same neighborhood.  Another over-hyped Toronto restaurant for the we-like-waiting-in-line crowd.",4.0,2.0,1287,2017-07-17,43.646411,-79.39348,Thai
KINKA IZAKAYA BLOOR,"TIP#1: Check out the floor seated traditional room! But you HAVE to reserve & request this in advance!TIP#2: Their $5 Sake bombs are super fun!  How to do the Sake bomb...1) balance the Sake shot glass between the chopsticks on top of the cup of beer2) once you're ready, the staff will make a ruckus and do the 'Sake bomb' chant with you & your friends3) after the chant you immediately use your hands to rumble the table to make the Sake shot glass drop into the beer. 4) CHUG CHUG CHUG! //SERVICE//This was my 2nd time at the Kinka Izakaya chain, but 1st time at this Bloor location. The servers were super great. Since it was my friend's birthday, they helped me hide the birthday cake. The energy from the Kinka staff is seriously unmatched whenever we have a birthday celebration or ordering Sake bombs ! //THE FOOD//Their izakaya pub foods are consistently great. I got my old favourites of Okonomiyaki (4/5), chicken karaage (5/5), ebi mayo(4/5), takoyaki (5/5), & karubi (4/5). It can add up to be very expensive but when you're sharing each dish with 2-3 people, it's much more reasonable ! Be careful with ordering their alcohol though! My friends ordered a small bottle of Mikan Shochu & didn't realize it was $41! Since Shochu is a liqueur similar to the alcohol content of vodka, sip it slowly !",4.0,5.0,379,2017-12-25,43.665157,-79.410658,"Japanese , Tapas/Small Plates , Pubs"
KINKA IZAKAYA BLOOR,"Love the food, but I likely won't come back if we have a bigger group. In some ways it seems perfect for groups since the sake bombs are really fun. But they will only give you one bill, it can be a pain to figure out if you have a large group, we had about eight people. It would be okay if you could just tell them what you ordered but that wasn't the case for us so calculating the bill was painful and it took so long for them to come with the machine (waited twenty minutes to pay).One member in our group was celiac so she asked about what dishes she could eat - they just gave her a confusing binder that didn't really clarify what dishes she could order. They were also out of one of the tempuras but didn't tell us so some people were waiting for food that never came. My friend's bimbimbap also didn't come until everyone's meal was finished. The salmon oshizushi and the bimbimbaps are among my favourite things, I'd just be wary of service if you have dietary restrictions or come in a larger group as communication and accommodation aren't their strong points.",4.0,3.0,379,2018-01-29,43.665157,-79.410658,"Japanese , Tapas/Small Plates , Pubs"
KINKA IZAKAYA BLOOR,"I stopped in on a weekend for lunch with a group of 14 people traveling from the states for a long weekend - we fit very comfortably in the dining space and there was more than enough elbow room. With that in mind, I believe that this is a restaurant that caters mostly to large groups. The atmosphere is fresh, traditional yet trendy, and very open - the open dining space can get very loud and very obnoxious if you're not there with a group. Even in a group, the tables are very large and you're not likely to hear anything going on at the other end, or even the other side!The service was just okay - the waitress was very peppy and took great care of us, but the food for the group did not come out at the same time. My boyfriend and I just ordered sashimi and fried chicken, but we didn't get our food until the entire rest of the table already had 2 or 3 dishes in front of them. Sometimes, it seemed like they just forgot about us until we asked (and even then, the waitress seemed surprised). Despite the average service, the food was on another level! The fish was fresh and vibrant and the fried chicken was crispy and delicious. I highly suggest getting the sashimi if you want lighter fare; the scallops were beyond compare! There was not a single disappointed stomach in the room, although there was some concern through the table about the raw beef dishes. One of the most important ""musts"" of Kinka if you're there with a large group is the sake bomb! You balance the sake on top of chopsticks over a glass of Sapporo and take it after banging on the table until the shot glass falls in. It's another excuse to be loud, obnoxious, and disruptive of other diners. Your Snapchat followers will be in awe! Overall, it was a fun and satisfying experience that became one of the highlights of our trip to Toronto.",4.0,4.0,379,2018-01-17,43.665157,-79.410658,"Japanese , Tapas/Small Plates , Pubs"
KINKA IZAKAYA BLOOR,"So I decided to give this place another shot. It has since changed the name, but the menu and concept are the same. This time I had a much better experience. We were in a group of people, so we got to try different dishes. All the dishes were all tasty, if not very big. The standard menus is not very extensive, but there were many daily specials on offer. Here's the rundown:Yakoyaki - Deep Fried Octopus BallsPrice: $5.50Rate: 3/5.Crunchy on the outside and nice and soft inside. But flavor was not big enough. Karaage - Deep Fried Soy Sauce Marinated ChickenPrice: $8.30Rate: 5/5Gorgeous nuggets of deep fried chicken goodness. Perfectly cooked, nice and moist inside. Rivals any Korean fried chicken. Ebimayo - Deep Fried Prawns with Spicy MayoPrice: $8.90Rate: 3/5Nice dish, but somewhat standard. The spicy mayo is the best part of the dish.Saba - Grilled MackerelPrice: $9:50Rate: 4/5Very tasty and flavorful. From the specials menu:---------------------------------Oyster Agedashi - $7.80Rate: 3/5Deef fried oysters, tofu and eggplant. Not bad.Seaweed roll of beef carpaccio with uni Rate: 5/5There were only two pieces, but those were two perfect bites of deliciousness. Outstanding dish, the best of the entire meal.  Taco Carpaccio - $9.50Rate: 5/5Outstanding dish of thinly sliced octopus with nice and smoky flavor. Delish. My second favorite dish. Miso Katso - $9.80Rate: 5/5Beautifully deep fried pork cutlet. Excellent dish.Risotto with Porcini MushroomsRate: 4/5Very rich and tasty risotto. Who know you could get a nice risotto in an izakaya? Pumpkin PieRate: 3/5The pie itself was alright, but not the best pumpkin pie I had. It also lacked some sweetness. But, the coconut ice-cream on top was delish!We shared the above between 4 people, and payed $27 per-person, after taxes and tip. It wasn't a lot of food to completely satiate us, but the price was reasonable. For drinks we had a sake. They do have a house sake ($6.5 for 150mL or $10 for 300mL), but we opted for the Izumi draft sake (from Toronto's Distillery District) at $20 for 300mL. It was served cold and was pretty tasty. There are other selections of higher-end sake as well.",4.0,4.0,379,2017-10-14,43.665157,-79.410658,"Japanese , Tapas/Small Plates , Pubs"
KINKA IZAKAYA BLOOR,"Ever hear the line ""If you're looking for a good time, call..."" Well, call Kinka.  I had the chance to eat at 2 great izakaya in Toronto back to back and both were very good.  I prefer Guu a little more just cause the food quality and presentation is just amazing ... BUT Kinka is definitely the more energetic and louder fun bar with still very good food!  I came in smiling the moment they started yelling and left with a bigger smile.Making reservations here is easy through Yelp and I highly recommend it.  Even on a weekday night, this place constantly had people come through non stop and though the tables do turn over quickly, there were many BIG groups of birthdays just doing sake bombs.  I think we saw at least 4 birthdays being celebrated in a little over an hour.If you're by yourself or just a twosome, try to grab the bar especially near the chefs.  It's LOUD but damn its fun to be near them as they constantly yell and shout.  It's not obnoxiously loud music thats being played but the 12+ staff just zooming around taking care of EVERY table and yelling with the chefs in response.  I've never had faster and still concerned service in a place like this.  The service here is 5+ from everyone... it's fast and fun.  It's never boring, cold, or disinterested.  I will say that the food here comes out just as quick as the service moving around ... we got our first 4 plates in less than 15 minutes.  Thank goodness we were starving so we can eat through the dishes quickly... regardless if you can use chopsticks or not!  They do provide knives and forks here for those who aren't expert at chopsticks or needing a hand to cut.Gomaae - This looks a little like ""the thing from the swamp"" when it first arrives with a black tar looking sauce covering the chilled spinach.  Just mix it up and let the bold sesame flavour hit your tongue.  The instagram trendy black carbon foods need to be sit down to this dish.  This one is a great even you think vegetables are not good.  4/5Salmon Tataki - Solid sashimi dish with several lightly seared salmon pieces with lots of crisp garlic and light tasting ponzu sauce.  I think it could have use a heavier dose of wasabi mayo as it was pretty lightly applied.  It needed that extra pep of wasabi heat 3.5/5Tuna Tataki - Similar to the Salmon tataki, this is another solid sashimi dish.  The fish was good if not a little light on flavour.  The garlic chips did add some but it could have use a bit more wasabi mayo perhaps. 3.5/5Okonomiyaki - This is a solid okonomiyaki but I found the Guu one still the best one in the city.  Kinka's version was tasty but it missed the flavour hit that makes you go wow and it was not as crispy as Guu's.  Kinka was definitely more 'pancake' like with it's softer dough.  It wasn't sauced evenly with the okonomiyaki sauce and perhaps thats why it wasn't as flavourful.  4/5Ikapiri - This was the stand out dish of the night and better than Guu for me.  Large but still tender pieces of freshly fried squid are nicely sauced up with a bit of heat and then topped with crunchy pieces (looks like shredded potato and wonton wrappers).  The sauce was nicely balanced and not really spicy to be honest.  Someone enjoyed this more than me because I couldnt cut it up fast enough to keep up with them eating it! (Disarmed ... riiight). 4.5/5Karaage - Generous pieces of chicken deep fried and served crispy.  I thought the crust was nice and crunchy while the meat was cooked fairly well.  I think it could the karaage crust bit seasoned more as the mayo didn't have a lot of seasoning in it to flavour the entire chicken bite.  4/5Sweet Almond Tofu - This reminds me of all the dim sum versions of the almond tofu.  It has a bit of a chew instead of a soft texture. Its tasty and light dessert but I would want to try another dessert next time. 3.5/5Peach Compote - This came off their special menu.  It's a generous big peach that was poached in a sweetened syrup, cored out, and then filled with some cheesecake.  On top of all that, throw in some coconut ice cream. I liked the peach and the overall flavour but just found each component not quite optimal... icy bits in the ice cream, generous peach size but very little cheesecake.  Cool looking dessert through   3.5/5Kinka is definitely one of those places that you keep on your mind when you want good food and a loud fun place to go with friends.  I LOVED the service here and the atmosphere is so great.  I'd be happy to return to try other dishes.",4.0,4.0,379,2017-08-25,43.665157,-79.410658,"Japanese , Tapas/Small Plates , Pubs"
KINKA IZAKAYA BLOOR,"I guess as really looking forward to this place as the menu choices looked great and the 4/5 stars in Yelp.It was busy but the two of us were quickly seated.We walked out. We got no service; perhaps the young staff only serve those under 40 as the whole crowd was young.The main reason we walked out was it was so loud we couldn't even talk to each other being sat across from each other and had to converse by texting each other on our phones.The staff, especially kitchen staff, should spend less time coming out and banging pots and yelling and cheering customers with birthdays etc and more time serving them!",4.0,1.0,379,2017-11-30,43.665157,-79.410658,"Japanese , Tapas/Small Plates , Pubs"

It was a 7 course meal so here goes.....Sashimi sampler: My fav - lobster tail, salmon and scallop. Was nice, cold and fresh. Seaweed & tofu salad: Light and not too saucy. Fry plate (karage & takoyaki): didn't try the takoyaki, but karage was fried nicely and had a good crunchGrilled pork cheek skewers: A bit chewy for me, but the taste was decent. Baked oysters: Nice and cheesy! Had potatoes mixed in as well which complemented well. Mushroom & Cheese bibimbap: Was quite big considering the size of the other dishes, more toppings would have been nice.Matcha ice cream: nothing too special, but at least its a dessert! Service: expected the almost non stop shouting and enthusiasm, did not expect to be that rushed for time.

KINKA IZAKAYA BLOOR,"This place is pretty cool. I enjoyed my experience here.Interior and exterior of the place is pretty dope. I loved how they blew up photos of the chefs as you walk inside. I love how the kitchen is open and you can see the chefs at work doing what they love. And I really enjoyed how there is one section where you can sit on stools and on the other side it looks like you need to kneel but you can actually sit on the pillow and you're like sitting on the edges of a square/ rectangle. Idk if I'm making any sense lol. It's pretty loud. So it's hard to make conversation. Customer service was wonderful. The servers are really nice, greets you when you enter and when you leave. It was my friends bday and they kindly switched our tables so we can be seated at the unique seats with the pillows I mentioned. They also enthusiastically sang happy birthday and the sake ball chant! My party of 7 ordered the set menu. $36 for: Gomaae: blanched rapini with sesame sauce. Presentation was cool but the taste was okay. Not something I'd order again tho. Karaage: deep fried soy sauce marinated chicken with garlic mayo. This was the bomb dot com. It was soooo delicious. I'd definitely order this again. Crispy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside. And they gave us a good size portion considering each chicken was huge. Top three dishes that I loved. Karubi: salt and pepper short ribs. It was okay. Could be more flavourful. Sashimi salad: it was good, fresh, colourful and tasty. Kaki mayo: baked oysters with spinach, mushroom and garlic mayo topped with cheese. Omg. The bomb dot com again. The oysters were huge! Came to us hot and the cheese so melty. Combo of the veggies and oysters were a hit. So good. My top three dishes that I loved.Kinoko bibimbap: in a stone bowl, rice, mushrooms, cheese and seaweed. The serve mixes it for us. This was another good dish. Gindara: grilled miso black cod. The skin was crunchy and tasty and the meaty part was so tender and delicious. Careful of the bones tho. My top three dishes that I loved. Salmon tataki: seared Atlantic salmon sashimi with ponzu, wasabi mayo, garlic chips and scallions. Melt in your mouth. So yummy. The garlic chips gave a nice texture and the wasabi mayo gave you a really good hit with flavour. And ice cream: coconut, green tea or black sesame. In addition I also got the matcha cheesecake. It included a matcha green tea cheesecake on one side of the plate, whipped cream in the middle and a cute bowl of green tea ice cream on the other side. It was pretty delicious. Pretty good.

KINKA IZAKAYA BLOOR,"Kinka Izakaya is an authentic Japanese restaurant that serves Starters, Cold Dishes, Salads, Deep Fried Items, Grilled and Baked Items, Rice and Noodles Items, and Sweets. The restaurant has dimmed lighting and popular hip hop music playing. There are a bunch of photos of Japanese geishas on the walls. The basket woven wall had empty beer bottles hanging from it.My party of six shared items from each category. I liked majority of the items except Unagi Somen and Sashimi Salad because I am allergic to horseradish and they mixed in the wasabi mayo.For drinks, we shared pitchers of Sapporo beer.For Starters, we had Gomaae, which consisted of blanched spinach drizzled with a thick black sesame sauce and sprinkled with white sesame seeds.For Cold Dishes, we had Maguro Tataki, which consisted of seared British Columbia tuna sashimi served over shredded radish in ponzu sauce and garnished with crispy garlic chips and Salmon Natto Yukke, which consisted of chopped salmon sashimi, natto, takuan, shibazuke, Scallion, cucumber, garlic chips, and raw egg yoke. Like a bibimbop, it came unmixed. It reminded me of a tartare because you would put the mixed ingredients on a piece of lightly salted nori.For Salad, we ordered all three - Seaweed and Tofu Salad, Sashimi Salad, and Gyu Shabu Salad. My favorite one was the Seaweed and Tofu, which consisted of fresh mixed greens, silken tofu, and marinated seaweed tossed in a sweet sesame dressing. The Sashimi Salad consisted of fresh mixed greens topped with wasabi mayo drizzled assorted sashimi. The Gyu Shabu Salad consisted of fresh mixed greens toped with shabu shabu beef and julianned bell peppers tossed in a black sesame dressing.For Specials, we ordered the Unagi Somen, which consisted of cold somen noodles served in dashi broth with BBQ eel, soft boiled egg, shredded egg omelette, scallion, and nori. I didn't like how the BBQ eel was drizzled with wasabi mayo. It didn't make consuming at an enjoyable experience.For Deep Fried Items, we ordered Takoyaki, which consisted of deep fried octopus balls served in tonkatsu sauce, drizzled with mayo, and topped with bonito flakes, and Agedashi Tofu, which consisted of crispy deep fried tofu in dashi broth. I think the Takoyaki would be better if not drenched in tonkatsu sauce.For Grilled and Baked Items, we ordered Kakimayo, which consisted of two large baked British Columbia oysters topped with mushrooms, spinach, garlic mayo and cheese, Gindara, which consisted of a grilled miso marinated black cod served over yuzu miso sauce, and Karubi, which consisted of grilled miso marinated beef short ribs. The Kakimayo reminded me of Oyster Rockefeller. I liked that the beef short ribs weren't too fatty. For Rice and Noodles, we ordered Saba Oshizushi, which consisted of blowtorched cured mackerel pressed sushi with grated daikon radish, and Salmon Oshizushi, which consisted of blowtorched Atlantic salmon pressed sushi with wasabi mayo. I loved the Saba Oshizushi.For Sweets, we ordered Matcha Mousse, which consisted of Green Tea Mousse with a graham cracker crust served with a scoop of red bean paste and a scoop of Matcha ice cream, and Almond Tofu, which consisted of cold, silky smooth, strong almond scented tofu gelatin served in a cup topped with whipped cream and garnished with a gojiberry.",4.0,5.0,379,2017-08-11,43.665157,-79.410658,"Japanese , Tapas/Small Plates , Pubs"

Now in terms of service, it was medicore. They were not really friendly, in fact I felt that they were a bit rude at times, and the funniest thing was they wouldn't allow a friend of mine to charge his iPhone (even though he had the charger and cable, just needed an outlet).

KINKA IZAKAYA BLOOR,"(4.5*) Came with three friends on new years eve. Before anything our main waitress was amazing, the other waitress that helped the main waitress out lacked communication and since me and my friends liked to take pictures before we eat she kinda ruined the natto yuuke we ordered ;/ Onwards we orderd a pitcher of sapporo and the 35/p course meal (along with a salmon natto yuuke bc it wasnt included and i wanted some lmao). They all came in this specific order.1. The chinese spinach slightly boiled paired with a sesame like sauce was such a good refreshing start. 2. Followed was the tofu and seaweed salad, was pretty good but wasn't like eyegoogling amazing or anything. 3. The salmon tataki was a definate melt in your mouth and the ponzu sauce wasn't overpowering or anything like it usually is and i cant taste the fish at all over the acidity. 4. The karaage came annd omg was it like so fucking juicy after you bite into it just like i hd it at the Church location; garlic mayo always onpoint. 4.b. This is where the natto yuuke came in and it was okay, i liked the church street one better because it had kimchi and  okra ;/ this place had cucumber and the yellow pickled radish meh lacks flavour compared to Kinka on Church5. THE OYSTERS ARE ALWAYS SO FUCKING HEART MELTING GOOD.6. The black cod literally melted in our mouths and using our chopsticks to cut the flesh was like cutting tofu wtf.7. The galbi was pretty melt like in your mouth too, was expecting it to be rubbery but it wasn't.8.

Farmhouse Tavern,"Driving along Dupont on a Saturday evening, saw this neat little place while stopped at a red light and decided to pop in for dinner. We sat on the patio and was greeted by super friendly staff immediately. Drink order was taken right away and was quite pleased with the beer selection. The menu was on a chalkboard which was nice and simple and our super informed server was able to answer the million questions I always seem to have while trying to make the best decision for my meal! We started with a couple of appetizers of twice baked beets and venison tartare. Wow. The flavors on each dish were incredible, and both were super fresh. For our mains my Mr. decided on the burger and I had the short rib pasta. Sooo good! His burger was sloppy, but we were warned! My pasta was perfect. Noodles cooked just right and the beef was crazy tender. The reason for the missing star was for the weird plastic outdoor chairs and the steep stairs to get to the basement bathroom!

Farmhouse Tavern,"A solid brunch spot with decent sized patio, tasty food, and friendly staff. True to its name, all portions are definitely 'Farm-Sized' so bring your appetite!Brunch today started with the most delicious CAESAR ($12) I've had in months. Extra spicy (w/ a kick of sriracha and horseradish), thick wedge of lemon and garnished with an oyster cradled in a slice of cucumber and topped with a caper-berry. *heaven* (just wish the oyster had been cold instead of room temp, which made me just a tiny bit apprehensive).BOOZY COFFEE ($7) was nice but nothing special.POACHED EGGS IN SQUASH ($14) is delish! 2 perfectly poached eggs nestled in half a small delicata squash roasted to sweet, smoky perfection (ideal for catching all the golden runny yolk). Served on a bed of mixed greens. VERY filling.FRENCH TOAST ($14) was also fab: thick slices of fresh house-made soda bread fried in oodles of butter and topped with summer sweet peaches and whipped cream. Served with a side of ridiculously thick-cut BACON ($3). The  order only comes with 2 slices but each slice is like 2 regular slices stuck together... halfway between bacon and peameal.A bit pricey for brunch... came to ~$60 for 2 plates, 2 drinks, incl taxes and tip but definitely would eat again.

Farmhouse Tavern,"When I moved to Toronto, years ago, I heard of the name ""Farmhouse Tavern"" more than once. Now that I live in the area, I had a chance to go several times. Their menu changes weekly, meaning fresh and seasonal which I think contributes to the popularity of Farmhouse. Not overly a huge fan of the patio but the décor inside is what gives more of an understanding of Farmhouse. Don't be discouraged it looks small once you walk in the front door, but you're only seeing the ""Tavern"" side. If you turn the corner to where the kitchen is situated, there's additional restaurant seating. Same Menu. The wait staff is superbly knowledgeable but almost to a point that when describing some attributes to the dishes sometimes it may turn you away. Your best luck is going with your gut or taking a peek at what your neighbour ordered. The Butcher's Board is a must but don't be fooled everyone is going to want to take a bite if you order it for yourself.Also, best time to go is on Sunday. You can have brunch and stay all day as every hour they have a new special from, $1 oysters, inexpensive wine and beer etc depending on the hour.",3.0,3.0,204,2017-09-03,43.664787,-79.455335,Canadian (New)

Farmhouse Tavern,"Good food... horrible serviceI came here on a Sunday for brunch and there was no wait.  They asked if we wanted to sit inside but all they had was bar sitting.  So we asked to sit outside.  They told us we can sit anywhere but scold at us when we choose a table for 4... um shouldn't have said anywhere.  So once we got all our stuff and moved they got our drinks.  I got hot coffee.  The person I came with asked for ice coffee but they only had hot coffee.  The coffee tasted watered down so we knew we had to go somewhere else after for coffee instead.  The waitress didn't really ask if it was our first time or explained the menu.  She just told us where the menus were.  They had two menus that were large hanging chalkboards which I thought was kinda cool.  There were 7 different options on their menu.  I went with their Benny w/ Kale ($13).  The person I came with choose their Mother & Child Reunion ($16).  My two benedicts included delicious biscuits topped with some kale, smoked ham, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce.  It was served with a salad.  I thought the entire dish was pretty good.  As for the Mother & Child Reuion, it included a duck leg topped with some cranberry served on a piece of bread served with a fried duck egg and some purple coleslaw.  It was served on a wooden board.  It was also pretty good.  The meat was flavored and cooked perfectly.  As for service, our waitress failed to come by to ask us if everything was okay or if we needed anything.  We never got refills on our waters or asked for more coffee.  We called her to ask for pepper but she brought back an empty pepper mill.  The restaurant is small.  There is a small outdoor patio.  Seating is a little tight.  The guy behind me was literally back to back with me.  On the day we came it was extremely windy.  Although the food was good, the lack of service left a bad taste in our mouths.  Not sure if I would come back.",3.0,3.0,204,2017-07-17,43.664787,-79.455335,Canadian (New)

Farmhouse Tavern,"Seriously one of the BEST brunch I've ever had! I arrived close to 3 pm on a Sunday afternoon. The place was packed but we didn't have to wait long before a table freed up. The staff gave a speedy explanation of their chalkboard menu. I ordered eggs benedict with bacon ($15) and my friend ordered the country breakfast ($15). My eggs benedict was so so delicious! The poached egg was cooked to perfection and they served two thick slices of fatty bacon. The muffin had a beautiful aroma of butter and an extremely crispy bottom. As for the country breakfast, the sausage complimented well with the mustard on the side, the scrambled eggs had a nice touch of dill and again, the bacon was very tasty- with a good ratio of meat and fat and not to mention, it was maple glazed. The thick cut terrine had a subtle, almost bland taste to it and so we paired it with the pear paste. It was fun exploring their choices/pairing of sauces and dish. I would say that their brunch is on the pricier end of the scale with choices starting at around $15 but seeing that I had a great experience here, I am looking forward to returning!",3.0,5.0,204,2017-01-05,43.664787,-79.455335,Canadian (New)

Farmhouse Tavern,"Vegetarians may want to 'steer' clear of this meat heavy space. I have to say, it's my kind of spot. Actually, the only issue if I can say that about this place is I do wish there was just a weeee bit more greens or even fruit with brunch. The sourdough bread was a nice touch but it was kind of tiny,I will say this, the food was spot on. I had basically a meat sampler for breakfast and my friend had the deck. We were both thrilled as beans with our meals and definitely noticed the lack of non meat product.Coffee was good but don't expect fancy coffee. It was pretty decent for a drip version so don't worry. Everyone was awesome that worked there and the chef was pretty chill when we had asked for a substitute.

My date opted for the Barnyard Burger ($21), which was a traditional burger with a sunny-side up duck egg and bacon. Our orders both looked better than they tasted. My grilled veggies were lifeless and charred. And the accompanying tomato sauce was tepid and flavourless. It reminded me of Heinz's tomato paste that had been smeared on top. From the first bite, it was obvious that the veggies had been pre-cooked and zapped. The hand cut fries, which had huge potential, were under salted and the portion was stingy. And the bite of burger that I tried was better, but not by much. I'm not sure what the hype was about...""",3.0,2.0,204,2017-09-16,43.664787,-79.455335,Canadian (New)

Farmhouse Tavern,"It's trying just a little too hard. It reminds me of Joe Beef in Montreal. The scene and the food are a just a touch TOO MUCH farm to table. Is that possible? Maybe. I get the whole rustic aesthetic. It's beautiful. But then the prices. Will people look back on our generation and laugh that we pay $25 for a brunch plate in an unfinished room with a half-painted wall and a door that's hanging sideways with cracked glass? Sometimes you have to laugh at fads. We had to enter the restaurant from a room that looked like it was just one step up from a hoarder's garage sale. The host guardedly barked ""Are you here for something?"" Well yes, maestro. Brunch. Jeesh. Hello to you too!Our waitress was beautiful and aloof, clad in Joe's Jeans and a cropped striped shirt that bared the tiniest swath of a toned waste. Her face was a perfect porcelain. At first I thought she was going to sell me makeup or designer clothing. But then, the descriptions of poached eggs, smoked caesars and foie gras lulled me back to the task at hand. The menu - only on the chalkboard, shockingly brief. Brevity is the soul of wit, yes, but I wasn't laughing here. Benedict, eggs in a nest (a sweet potato nest and side salad...oh no), duck confit, bread pudding. Not a BAD selection by any means, but certainly quite limited and all selections between $15-25. Drinks at least $10. Even for a mimosa. Overall, it was a decent brunch in terms of the quality. The mother and child reunion had its highs and lows: the high was the fried duck egg. Gorgeous egg yolk with the perfect amount of runny vs structure. The low was the MINISCULE piece of foie gras, followed by the overcooked duck confit. The benedict was better, but not spectacular. So-so. And with the high price tag, I'd probably forego brunch at this place again in the future and hang back at a place where the floorboards are finished. Just kidding. But seriously.

The place is dark and hip with bar seating, 2 high top tables for larger groups and a few two person tables. As such, it can get quite packed and you will need to get on the waitlist.We came on a Saturday night and waiting around 25 minutes but the waitress gave us a call to let us know our table would be ready soon and the customers before were getting their bill. For the food, we opted for the Loosey, smoked pork belly mandoo, steamed bun and the kimchi pork belly fried rice. My least favourite would have to be the fried rice. Although it had a lot of ""wok"" flavour, I felt that it was too overpowering and I could not taste any Kimchi and the pork belly was nowhere to be found. The smoked pork belly mandoo was not what I was expecting as  it was a fried dumpling served with a delicious mayo sauce, scallions and a red pepper garnish. I liked the combination of flavours with the crispy mandoo and the smoked pork belly essentially tasted like bacon. As for the Loosey, this is a must try and probably get your own order because it's that good!

My wife was a big fan of the wings; I thought they were a little over-breaded and over-sauced. The pork belly and kimchi fried rice was good but not as delicious as the snackier part of the menu. Buffalo tofu was perfectly crispy and nailed the taste of classic buffalo wings.The room is more welcoming than sister restaurant Hanmoto, but the food is not quite as good.

Wings were the hit of the evening.  Perfectly cooked and juicy, and heavy on the sweet & spicy chili sauce.  And surprisingly, they were FULL giant chicken wings.  For comparison sake, the three giant wings are the equivalent of six wings that you would get from any standard restaurant.  But unfortunately, that's as good as the food got.The Squash Poutine features a savory Japanese curry instead of gravy.  But instead of featuring the dominant flavour of curry and squash, the dish ends up competing too much with the flavours of the kimchi, pickled beets and garlic mayo.  The Tempura Prawns were okay, but the prawns were completely overshadowed by the giant lemon wedge on the plate.  Four very puny-sized prawns covered in sriracha mayo, that looked like they were over-garnished to compensate for their size.  Finally, we finished with the Bulgogi Cheesesteak.  If this sandwich is supposed to be resemble bulgogi, then they need to change their name to ""Odd McDonald's"".  It was basically loose ground beef that was slathered with garlic mayo on a french roll.So have you figured out what I meant about being a ""one trick pony""?  With exception for the wings, the common theme among all the dishes was mayo.  Maybe that's just bad luck with ordering, but I find it hard to believe that no one else hasn't noticed the same dominant condiment in many of their dishes.  I get that it's supposed to be Korean-fusion, but assembling flavours that compete with each other, and slathering everything with mayo isn't fusion.  For fusion to truly work, you need authentic cuisine elements that COMPLIMENT each other.That being said, PERHAPS this place isn't about the food?As an establishment, Odd Seoul has a great vibe and lots of personality.  There's no sign on the exterior.  You could walk by this place many times (which I have), and think that the establishment has been condemned.  I've eaten at their next-door neighbours numerous times and whenever I saw Odd Seoul, I thought it was always under construction.  The interior has a great dive bar atmosphere; from the retro ghetto blaster stereos, to the scarred brick walls, to the empty ammunition boxes at the bar counter.  On a weird side note, if this place is supposed to be a Korean dive bar, then why is the food served on Chinese dinnerware?If I were to make a return visit, I think I'd come back for the drinks. They feature a small, but flavourful variety of cocktails (I recommend the ""Liberace""). Great atmosphere, good music, friendly staff, and good drinks. But if Odd Seoul is really intent on being an interesting place for food, then they should really consider revamping their menu options and putting that pony out to pasture.",4.0,3.0,226,2017-04-10,43.64619,-79.419686,"Korean , Dive Bars , Asian Fusion"
Odd Seoul,"My friend and I shared the squash Poutine (our fav!!), the chicken + devilled eggs, and avo salad (fresh and tasty!). Came out very satisfied with full bellies and a reasonable bill. Highly recommend sharing dishes and getting a variety of flavour and textures (crunchy chicken, soft squash, fresh salad..) and a few drinks from the full bar!",4.0,4.0,226,2017-12-14,43.64619,-79.419686,"Korean , Dive Bars , Asian Fusion"
Odd Seoul,Probably one of my favorite spots in the city! The loosey and the squash poutine are my favorite items! Everything is tapas and meant to share but could crush a whole poutine to myself!

Odd Seoul,"I am a huge fan of traditional Korean flavors, but this place has a western twist. The spicy chicken wings are incredibly addictive, and I've come back a number of times just to have them again! The torched mackerel was tasty also.

Odd Seoul,"Wow! Shockingly awful service and even more shocking bill.I attempted to order one of their cocktails, the Odd Fashioned with Bulleit bourbon rather than the Crown Royal that it came with.The original cocktail I tried to order was $11. Somehow my Old Fashioned was $18.I was charged $14 for an old fashioned a $4 for selecting a premium liquor... Sidenote: Bulleit bourbon appears in one of the other $11 cocktails and no other drink on the menu starts at $14.I brought this up to the waiter, and he just said that's how much it is and too bad.Side-side note: the service was insane from the moment I walked in and I probably should have just trusted my instincts.I walked in took a seat at a group table in the mostly empty bar and very unhappy looking waitress asked me if I could move somewhere else (which was fine, but no one there seemed to be in a good mood - which really just isn't a good sign that things are being run well.After being seated, I was handed off to another waiter, who seemed much friendlier, but who had some of the most intense body odor I've experienced outside of walking past a particularly smelly homeless person. But I was like, hey, at least he's friendly and the drink I got was reasonably good, as was the food.Again, the trouble came with how he handled the cocktail price... I mentioned that it seemed inordinately high, compared to the prices of the listed cocktails and that he might consider telling a customer if they are about to order a drink that is almost exactly like the listed cocktails, but for which they will be charged $18 instead of $11 dollars for. I'm very glad I didn't order more than one of those!I'm not personally going to miss the extra few dollars, but I feel that the pricing was completely ridiculous and that they are trying to see what they can get away with. As soon as I walked out the door, I felt like I should have actually fought the charge, but it was very unexpected, as I've never had a bar charge me so much for a cocktail (and I live in NYC, so that's saying something).",4.0,1.0,226,2016-12-19,43.64619,-79.419686,"Korean , Dive Bars , Asian Fusion"
Odd Seoul,"Awesome place!! Came here around 9PM last night for some late night eats and drinks. It did not disappoint. Very reasonably priced and great shared dishes.It gets busy so try to come early! We had to wait around 30 minutes for a group of 5 of us, but it was well worth the wait. 1.) Food:I highly recommend the Bulgolgi Cheesesteak and Loosey sandwiches. $5 a piece, we ended up getting three orders of each because they were so good!!! One of the best tasting bulgolgi I've had in a while and it's perfect with the cheese. They come in servings of two sandwiches. We were also pleasantly surprised by the squash poutine (delicious, try it you won't be disappointed) - the squash goes very well with the kimchi.I was underwhelmed by the O.S. wings and the Smoked Pork Belly Mandoo. I personally felt the O.S. wings were way too drenched in sauce for my liking (but two of my friends loved it). I had expected the mandoo to be like traditional dumplings but they ended up being deep fried ball-things, which tasted good but just not what I expected.2.) Drinks:We got two soju infusions (which they make in house) which were awesome. At $18 per bottle there is more than enough to share approximately 3 rounds between the 5 of us (awesome price!). We tried the Cucumber (highly recommend!! it is so yummy and refreshing!) and the Grapefruit. 3.) Atmosphere:Great vibe, small place. Didn't see much of our server, which was okay. As I mentioned it's a really small place so come early if you don't want to be waiting a long time outside. We were there for around 2 hours and by 10PM there was a line.4.) CostWe ordered around 12 dishes in total, had one beer each, and shared two soju infusion bottles. Total cost was around $40 per person. We eat a lottttt and were completely stuffed by the end of the meal and felt it was very fairly priced.All in all, really dig this place and will come back again :)",4.0,4.0,226,2017-08-19,43.64619,-79.419686,"Korean , Dive Bars , Asian Fusion"
Odd Seoul,"We walked past the place trying to find it, there is no signage so you've got to follow the numbers on the doors and mailboxes. We finally spotted the place because their name is fortunately on their health inspection sign (they passed, no worries). We were seated quickly and told there's limited seating time of an hour and a half, understandable as the entire place looked to have space for only about 25 patrons, including the bar. The menu is simple - a one pager without about a dozen tapas, a few larger portion mains, and a selection of cocktails and ""communal"" drinks. We got great explanations of the food items from our server and ordered a few tapas and a main dish to share. I found the service to be polite and honest, perhaps there's been improvement following the many bad reviews stemming from their service in the past.For tapas we ordered the squash poutine, OS wings, the Loosey, and tempura chicken with deviled egg. Everything was flavourful and apparent in their fusion aspects. If you're into the kind of fusion where the main ingredients are western but the flavours and cooking styles are eastern, this is the place to be. For those looking for unexpectedly new combinations that just work and you wish you'd known about all your life - probably not the spot.The squash poutine was squash home fries topped with a bunch of sauces that reminded me of Chinese food - the sauce to go with your fatty pork on rice - and takoyaki. There was also a bed of cabbage - to remind you of kimchi? Overall it was okay, a little bit skimpy on portion for the price. I definitely recommend the Loosey, which is a miniature beef sandwich with slaw - the meat was flavourful and juicy, and the toasted bread went perfectly with it. It also easily splits in two for sharing, which was convenient for ordering with friends. As to the tempura chicken...tasted like fish batter on chicken. If you ever want a very chewy filet-o-fish, this is it. The deviled egg was great, and I enjoyed the humour of placing chicken and egg at the same time on one plate. It was generally disappointing. For the main dish we got Brick Chicken - it was a fried chicken base with Korean barbecue sauce, kimchi, and slaw, served with radish bun sheets and white rice. The radish and the spicy chicken went together surprisingly well and I enjoyed the refreshing bitter-sweet-savoury combination a lot, which rounded nicely into a spicy kick at the end. Unfortunately a lot of the sauce is wasted as the slaw slowly soaks it up - if you're hungry you can mix the rice in to get the last of it, though the bottom is mostly spicy sauce from the kimchi. This plate was a highlight of the items we got for the creativity and execution. We also got a communal rice wine drink which was cutely served in a pot with small drinking bowls instead of cups. The bowls worked well to fit the slices of lime, though overall the rice wine was overshadowed by the lime and I felt like I was drinking an infinite vodka sour with the burn taken off.For the price at the end I felt I didn't get my money's worth in portion size, nor the excitement of fusion Korean that I was hoping for. A cute place for sure, but I feel better quantity/quality for price can be found in other locations in the city.",4.0,3.0,226,2016-07-09,43.64619,-79.419686,"Korean , Dive Bars , Asian Fusion"
Odd Seoul,"My husband and I loved this place and can't wait to bring our friends.It's a cosy and fairly dark place and you will likely face a long lineup but Ossington is a great place for a stroll while you wait. Pricing is also very reasonable.We got the Avacado Slaw (amazing- will order again), the squash poutine (definitely recommend), the Kim Chi pork belly (won't blow you away but good value and tasty), and the loosy (greasy but worth it!).Overall we really enjoyed our experience and are looking forward to going back.",4.0,5.0,226,2016-12-23,43.64619,-79.419686,"Korean , Dive Bars , Asian Fusion"
Aloette,"Located just below Alo, the #1 restaurant in Canada at the moment, Aloette is Patrick Kriss' more relaxed, low key restaurant with a retro diner feel, lower price point and surprisingly generous portion sizes while still maintaining the same great service and quality as its sister restaurant. We dined as a party of three and were so stuffed that we had to pack some of it home.To start we were offerred complementary homemade cheese bread. I absolutely loved the bread as it was not overly cheesy (the cheesey bits seemed to be on the crust only and the bread itself was light and fluffy. It came with yeast butter which was rich, buttery and delicious.For appetizers, we had the Beef Tartare ($14) and the Scallop Tostada ($14). Topped with a creamy horseradish and dijon sauce and then covered with capers, scallions and warm crispy fried onions, the tartare was a delicous mix of tangy and savoury. The beef was fresh and not too ground up making it perfect for spreading onto the gem lettuce leaves that accompanied the dish. I really liked the different textures in this appetizer. The crispy lettuce and fried onions really added a nice crunch and freshness to the beef tartare. And to top it all off, the portion size was quite generous - more than enough for three people to share.The Scallop Tostada was also extremely tasty. The homemade tostadas were light and crispy. They were then topped with Hamachi sashimi, diced Granny Smith apples, pickled pearl onions, jalapeño and cilantro resulting in a tangy sweet burst of flavour. One order comes with three tostada - perfect for a light snack!For our mains, we had the Aloette Burger ($18), the Roasted Pork ($20) and the Ribeye Steak ($36). The the juicy burger comes sandwiched between two house made buns and is topped with sauteed onions, shredded lettuce, cheddar cheese mayo and fried Beaufort cheese. On the side, there's a pile of addictive double-cooked fries, a pickle, and the tangy dressing which has a bit of a kick at the end. The fries were incredibly good and we were told that it takes two days to make since they need to soak the potatoes overnight in order to remove the starch and sugars required to make the perfect crisp fry.The ribeye was rich and buttery and glazed with a chimichurri sauce. The fresh, slightly spicy, garlicky and citrusy sauce really brought out the deep earthy flavours of the beef. The steak was topped with few sautéed shishito peppers which added a grassy, smoky and citrusy component to the dish. To finish off the plate, there was another generous serving of fries.My favourite of all the main dishes was the Roasted Pork. It had a good fat to meat ratio and was extremely juicy and tender. The pork was the topped with , sautéed esacarole, chopped cerignola olives, and nduja (a spreadable mixture of pork, fat and chilli) resulting in an amazingly earthy, zesty and spicy flavour combination. A must have!As sides we added on the Brussels Sprouts ($9) and Aloette Fries ($9). You know a restaurant is great when they make Brussels Sprouts that you can't stop eating even when you're super full! They might not be much to look at but this would be the one dish that I would definitely order again and again. The Brussels Sprouts were roasted beautifully so that they were soft and tender on the inside but perfectly browned one the outside with lots of loose leaves that are nice and crispy. The sauce was a tangy sweet maple gastique with chopped walnut and whole mustard seeds giving it some interesting textures. The flavours were a mix of tangy and savoury with a little bit of sweetness from the roasting. Absolute perfection! The acidity of this also really helps to cut through the richness of the other dishes you may order!The Aloette fries with smoked gouda hot sauce and jus, was the one dish we could have done without. Because the fries were covered with the melted creamy gouda, it overpowered the delicious fries themselves and made the fries less crispy. I think I actually preferred the fries on their own. The flavour to me was actually a little mild and I had difficulty detecting the smokiness of the gouda.For dessert, we tried the Lemon Meringue Pie ($10). Personally, I found this just ok (but keep in mind that lemon meringue is usually not my dessert of choice).  The lemon flavour really came through in the pie and the filling was actually quite tart. I was impressed with the meringue which had a nice subtle lemon flavour and the sweetness of the torched marshmallows helped to balance out the tartness of the pie. Probably a good choice who prefer tart desserts.",4.0,5.0,52,2017-12-23,43.648539,-79.395937,"French , Bistros , Diners"
Aloette,"I may be the outlier here or a victim to the over-hype, it's hard to say. I have not been to Alo (their sister resto) but have heard good things. The same goes for Aloette, I've heard a lot of buzz surrounding the two places. So we finally were able to give it a try...First off - The menu was limited to the point where I was quite indecisive on what to order; so we opted to try a couple of apps (scallop tostada & tuna tartar) and split the Alloette Burger between the two of us...The tuna tartar was pretty good and a decent portion. The scallop tostada was tasty, but they were small and not a lot of scallop came with the order. As for the burger; it was super popular. I sat near the kitchen and almost every table in the place had ordered one. However; in my opinion it was just ok... If you are selective with your burger (as I am), you may not be too impressed. It's slightly bigger than a slider and a bit bland. The beef patty was cooked well done and dried out, which leads me to assume the quality of beef is of low grade - condiments were a must...Additionally, our server told us that our order was enough food for two, but I could have had more...For what it's worth, the others at my table had the black forest sundaefor dessert and absolutely loved it!I wouldn't necessarily write this place off per se, I would be open to trying other items on the menu. But I wouldn't make it my priority to return any time soon...",4.0,3.0,52,2018-01-28,43.648539,-79.395937,"French , Bistros , Diners"
Aloette,"This spot is cozy and the food is on the mark! We've been to Alo and wanted to check out Chef Kriss' new diner. We went during the first week they opened and didn't have to wait for a table at 5:15pm. Been back another time and it was only a 5-10 min wait. It's a great casual spot - the menu is limited but changes every now and then. I had the braised lamb couscous and loved it! Great flavours that blend really well together with sliced radish and oranges mixed in. The poutine is average but then again, I've never had great poutine in Toronto. The service is perfect and drink offerings are abundant. I love having different wines that the sommelier of a reputable restaurant selects and this place offers exactly that.",4.0,4.0,52,2018-01-25,43.648539,-79.395937,"French , Bistros , Diners"
Aloette,"Great Location as it's right at Queen and Spadina. VERY SMALL so make sure you get there early. We started off with complimentary cheese toast and butter. Absolutely delicious, wasn't too intense, and it was very comforting. We ordered the aloette burger (5 stars) had melted beaufort cheese, onion, lettuce and pickles. The quality of the meat was outstanding and I liked that the bun had a crunch to it. We opted for the Aloette fries which has melted smoked gouda, hot sauce and jus - fries were perfection, I would say the hot sauce has an interesting flavor but it wasn't spicy for me. Also ordered the Mac and Cheese as a side. Not bad, not my favorite as it wasn't cheesy and I wish they used smaller noodles. overall this was A-Ok! I would come back if I was in the area.

Aloette,"WHAT TO TRY?!?The roasted pork, the ribeye steak and the crispy squash. And the complimentary bread is great too!We debated between the roasted pork and the Cornish hen and decided on the roasted pork at the end. We're happy that we went with the roasted pork because it was simply phenomenally delicious. Beware, it is on the fattier side because the pork is the pork belly so that's why it tastes meltingly oozing good. Full of flavour and the right proportion of fat to meat in alternate layers. Some chunks of pork salumi was also in the dish too. The ribeye steak just melts in your mouth. Ribeye steak has more marbleized patterns of fat to meat because of where it is on the cow so of course the juices are soaked into the fat of this type of steak. Meat was tender and the thickness was just right. Wasn't too thick and we got two slices of the steak! Marvellous. Fries were crispy and has a nice crunch. Wasn't hard and wasn't cold, so you know you're getting fresh fries to order.  The chimichurri sauce was a nice addition to the steak as well because it compliments well with the steak. Crispy squash is not something you see on a menu everyday. It's a nice side dish to have on a cold winter evening. Squash reminds me of the fall and cold weather and thought it was a fitting dish. It's unique because it's garnished with roasted pumpkin seeds and brown butter is poured on here. Has a sweet finish so if you don't like your sides sweet, you might not like this dish. But it's very rich in the taste of butter..reminds me of cream cheese actually!The ambiance in here is spectacular! Very cozy and makes you feel like home with their utmost on point customer service. Alo takes pride in their amazing detail oriented customer service and you can see their attention to patrons' needs in their service here too. Waiters and waitresses are always making sure glasses are full, spills are wiped and cloths are folded when customers leave their seats among other things that they do. Goes a long way when customers are having a great meal that is complimented with impeccable customer service!LAST TIP?!There's no reservations allowed and it's only walk in. So if you want to grab a seat, either come a later time in the evening like 8-9 or on those cold winter days, that's when the traffic is not as high and you have a better chance at getting a spot. Otherwise, wait times can be upwards to an hour or more!!!",4.0,4.0,52,2017-12-28,43.648539,-79.395937,"French , Bistros , Diners"
Aloette,"Aloette is the Sister of Alo located in the same building. A casual French bistro and a complete different approach to food compare to Alo. I love the concept and the playful menu.The interior is chic and welcoming. Since it is first come first serve with no reservation, I suggest to come by early for dinner or a late lunch to minimize wait time. Since it is new and everyone wants to dine here, so don't be frustrated and surprised with the long wait for an available table.Just like Alo, the service here is friendly and attentive. The dish here is great for sharing or even enjoy by yourself.

Aloette,"I have yet to actually try the well known Alo restaurant ( I really should start using my gift certificate soon lol), but since I was downtown for an appointment and one of my friends raved about this restaurant, I decided to try it for lunch with two other friends (one who's been there before once), and another friend who is also trying this place out for the first time.My friend told me that the last few days he walked by there wasn't much wait time.. so of course the actual day where we ended up going, there was a bit of a wait lol. Which was not too bad, about 20 mins, right at 12:30pm lunch rush. So we left them our contact and off we went to do some walking and shopping and they texted us when the table was ready. This restaurant does not do any reservations - walk-ins only.This restaurant replaced the old nail salon that used to be under the Alo restaurant, so I think it's a clever move on their part to convert the bottom level to a fining dining with a bit of a bar/rustic look and with price points that are more affordable than the Alo. Of course, for the average person grabbing lunch, this is certainly not the cheapest meal, but definitely one of the best :)We ended up ordering 1 appetizer, 3 entrees and a dessert. So let me break down each dish for you:First off... their complimentary bread with the burnt butter... holy jeez it was amazing and to die for! I'm still thinking about it as I'm writing it... I almost wanted to ask for more!beef tartare - portion was quite good for its price, the beef is minced but not too grounded up - perfect to spread on the lettuce wraps that it comes with for a bit of crunch. delicious! the beef was very well seasoned and I loved the crunch from the lettuce. Each of us were able to have about 2-3 pieces of this assembly.cornish hen - portions again, quite substantial. It doesn't really come with much sides, aside from a mix of olives and peppers at the bottom. I normally don't eat olives, but this... this I will devour :) the garnishes complements the hen very well, and definitely one of the most soft and moist chicken I've had in a while!Salmon - portions were good and the salmon was moist but firm as well - perfect texture, and not overcooked. The garnishes and sauce that came with it was quite nice! I liked the crunch from the microgreens and the sauce was delicious!Macaroni and cheese - this... wow. it's super filling - the portion isn't very large, but it's definitely very rich. I liked how it's baked on a cast iron mini skillet so there's a bit of a crust on the pasta as well. it comes with a spicy tomato/ketchup sauce and I'm pleasantly surprised at how well they go together and the heat is just a notch, perfect for the taste without overpowering the mac and cheese itself. Aloette fries - for those who like poutine... you will definitely like their take on the fries. Sausage gravy and cheese - it was amazing. The amount you get is quite good for its price (i'ts a side that we ordered separately because the add on fries with the beef tartar doesn't have the fixings), and we were already pretty stuffed after eating these four dishes that we actually had some trouble finishing!Since we were so full... we decided to share a pc of lemon meringue pie. It was amazing! If i had more time i woudl've gotten coffee to enjoy with it. the lemon tartness is quite present, and balancing out the sweetness of the pie itself. The top is torched marshmellows... quite a delightful pairing and between the 3 of us, the pie is quite sizeable, and we coudln't finish because we were THAT full. On top of that, they changed our dishes and cutlery between courses. Service is definitely wonderful.Their menu selection is not very large.. so every item we ordered off the menu was spot on perfect, which is expected of a restaurant when they cater only to a handful of dishes. But I will say this: Price point - yes it's about 35 per person plus tip... but definitely an amazing meal and I was quite satisfied :) Order anything on their menu and I don't think you will be disappointed. I would definitely recommend trying if you haven't already!",4.0,5.0,52,2017-12-08,43.648539,-79.395937,"French , Bistros , Diners"
Aloette,"The restaurant is stunning, every detail has been thought out. There's even a nook in the middle of the two booths to fit the water carafe.The food is decadent, and delicious! I would recommend the beef tartare, and the hamachi appetizer has a curry-like sauce. For entree, the burger is top notch, and the pork is super flavourful and a bit on the greasy side so sharing is recommended. Here is where the one star is missing. The service is attentive but if anything, a little too much. The waiters would come and get things from you while in the middle of the conversation. The table was dirty when I sat down, and we were not given napkin until asked. Regardless, I still had a great time, and would come again!

It would be hard to chose my favourite menu item since all plates were absolutely delicious and perfectly put together, each with their own special flavour and texture and all that yummy goodness. I would have to say though that the ribeye steak completely blew my mind and I'm getting all warm and fuzzy feels thinking about it today. Bone marrow butter - that's all that needs to be said. The chef knows what he's doing when even the iceberg wedge wows you. I would never order it, let alone write about salad in a review but it pleasantly surprised me with its combination of chive cream, avocado, pumpkin seeds, and parmesan cheese. The result is you can't go wrong with anything you order.The design is stunning - Reminds of an olden day fancied up cable car. The customer service is top notch - everyone works together to make this dining experience a memorable one that will want you coming back for more... and I will most definitely be coming back for more!Just some tips: make a reservation since the wait list can get filled up; parties can't be bigger than 4 people; even if you're full, get the dessert!",4.0,5.0,52,2017-11-03,43.648539,-79.395937,"French , Bistros , Diners"

Aloette,"Aloette is a causal french bistro locates on the ground floor of same building of its well-known sister, Canadian's best restaurant, Alo. Although Aloette is supposed to be more down to earth, it doesn't mean the level of service or food are lesser quality.I was greeted by the friendly manager when I entered the bistro, and they offer coat check service. The restaurant was small and cozy; tables can fit group of 4 at most. The decor is classy and resemble Alo's style. I was seated at the bar and was excited to see the beautiful dishes coming out from kitchen.The menu is simple yet it covers the seafood, meat, vegetarian options in appetizers and mains. The drink menu offers choices of cocktail, beer, wine, pops and juice. I tried the Beef Tartare appetizer with a Kale Celery juice. My food and drink arrived at the same time and came with a complimentary bread and spread. First of all, the portion of the beef tartare was pretty generous. The beef was very fresh and nicely topped with sauce made with horseradish, caper, Dijon. The sauce was little on the salty side. The Kale juice was refreshing as well. The bread and spread on the house was warm and fresh. Service was attentive during my whole meal; my glass was never empty. My waiter (I believe he is the manager) came regularly to ensure everything was fine. Even chefs were friendly and gave me friendly smile. Since it was the first official day of service, Chef Patrick Kriss was there and he greeted me.I will definitely go back with my friends to try all the dishes on the menu.",4.0,5.0,52,2017-10-18,43.648539,-79.395937,"French , Bistros , Diners"
Aloette,"Don't understand the hype because it was just okay. Wouldn't say it is worth the wait unless you are nearby the area and can come back when you are up especially since they don't take reservations. The menu is kind of small and I had difficulty in choosing a dish (I normally don't prefer to order seafood or steak mains which took up at least 50% of the menu) so I opted for their famous burger and upgraded to Aloette fries to share.Burger was pretty salty but decent. Aloette fries on the other hand are highly questionable. It is like fries drizzled with some cheese that you can't taste but made the fries more soggy and greasy, and lots of sriracha. Doesn't go well at all and honestly the regular plain fries tasted better. Many other customers actually left a good chunk of their fries as I saw the staff throw out lots of leftovers from 3-4 people. If you go, JUST GET REGULAR FRIES!!The bread and dip they give to start is great though, haha.",4.0,3.0,52,2018-01-03,43.648539,-79.395937,"French , Bistros , Diners"
Aloette,This was a planned trip with Yelp Eating Buddies (YEB) one of the trio had tried this spot before so recommended we go for an early dinner as the waits can be taxing. So on a bitter cold afternoon at an odd time for dinner the place was packed to the brim and we grabbed the last table. I guess the popularity/rave reviews of Alo has trickled down to this spot literally :) The beer list is OK while the cocktails/wine list seemed decent. After going through the menu we decided on the followingBeef Tartar: Decent at this price point and. Spiced wellAloette Burger. Ho Hum IMO as the cheese was so salty I could barely taste anything after few bites. Side of fries was goodCornish Hen: Decent again. I am a fan of oyster mushrooms and I think they elevated this dish.Desserts we ordered bothLemon Meringue Pie: Very good IMO. The lemon curd had the right amount of tang which is mostly amiss at other locations/stores. Meringue on top was good as well.Apple Pie Sundae. A deconstructed version of apple pie à la mode. OK though beware this will be very hard to share.Decent price point for a bistro so 3.5 stars all said and done though I think will return to try brunch at the very least.,4.0,3.0,52,2017-12-28,43.648539,-79.395937,"French , Bistros , Diners"
Aloette,"First day!  Grand opening!  Hooray!No kinks to iron out.  Just like Alo, service was amazing. Excellent, personable staff. Incomparable for a casual restaurant.  We tried 3 appetizers: hamachi, tartare with fries, and clams.  We had 3 drinks.  They were all good.  Keep in mind, this isn't upstairs.  It's definitely way more accessible to the masses. Prices are very reasonable for a casual night out.  Also, they take no reservations!  First come, first served. I want to say we really appreciated the fact that Chef Kriss made his rounds and personally greeted his patrons.  He thanked us for coming on this first day.  We didn't feel like customers, we felt like guests.  It was that added touch of humble gratitude that makes me a true, dedicated fan.We will definitely be back to try the mains!",4.0,5.0,52,2017-10-17,43.648539,-79.395937,"French , Bistros , Diners"
Aloette,Walk in only restaurant however very organized setup! Came in on a THurs evening w/ a girlfriend at around 6pm & put out names on the waitlist. Got an immediate txt saying im on the waitlist - in a matter of 30mins i got a txt saying my table was rdy. The balsam spritz was really refreshing & the foam was a creamy orange float - so delicious!! The bread and yeast butter was soooo good - i kept the butter spread for the remainder of the meals. Got the rib eye as my main - med to medium rare and it was tender and juicy! Dessert we got the apple pie sundae and the crumble was what stood out the most - definatelty a dessert to share! Overall great experience w/ great staff. I dropped my napkin on the floor & the staff noticed and picked it up without me knowing and handed me a new one - that is what you call great cx service (:,4.0,4.0,52,2017-12-22,43.648539,-79.395937,"French , Bistros , Diners"
Aloette,"This was actually a really difficult review for me to write. To be quite honest, I was a bit underwhelmed by the food, as I had very very high expectations after reading so many rave reviews and knowing Alo's reputation. I enjoyed most of my dishes, but wasn't really blown away by any of them, and some of the dishes I actually didn't enjoy. Overall, I would give the restaurant a 3.5 (3 for the food, and 0.5 for the value/price point + service & ambience of the restaurant). My friend and I tried 5 dishes and left feeling very very full, and after splitting the bill in half paid around $40 each before tip.The restaurant does not take any reservations, and apparently they cap their waitlist at 5 parties. Also, they only serve parties of 4 people or less. I came on a Thursday and put my name and number on the waitlist at around 5:40, and only had to wait about 15 minutes before they texted me telling me a table was ready. The menu isn't huge, but has a good amount to keep it interesting without being overwhelming. It also has great variety and a couple of really interesting-sounding dishes. We ordered the charred chorizo ($12), burgundy snails ($14), ribeye steak ($28), broccoli ($9), and brussels sprouts ($9). I enjoyed the snails, steak, brussels sprouts, and the complimentary bread that came before our meal (one piece per person) which was warm, fresh and fragrant. The steak was cooked perfectly, but I was a bit disappointed that the bone marrow butter didn't seem to add anything special to the steak. I thought the chorizo was actually too dry (perhaps overcooked?) although I enjoyed the eggplant and halloumi in the dish. The broccoli was a huge letdown, because I had heard it was really good, but found the dish WAY too salty. I think there might have been too much sauce, because by the end of our meal, it had just soaked through all of the broccoli and left it all soggy - we weren't even able to finish it.I sadly would not place Aloette on my list of favourite restaurants in Toronto, BUT given the price point and sharing-plate style of dining, I wouldn't mind returning a second time to try some other items. The service is stellar, and I felt well-attended to from the second I entered until the moment I was handed my coat and bid farewell. The ambience is also great, because it does feel relaxed and fun, but still classy.",4.0,3.0,52,2017-11-18,43.648539,-79.395937,"French , Bistros , Diners"
Aloette,"Just finished dinner at Aloette and I'm ridiculously happy and basking in latent food-gasm glow. We sat at the bar and had one of the most fun and well executed dinners we've had in ages. The chorizo was a varied plate with peppers, confit garlic, rice crackers and LOVE . The thoughtful presentation and harmony of flavours put this dish above and beyond what other restaurants are doing for small plates.The bread with whipped brown butter was absolute heaven. I generally don't eat bread, but this is something special!Clams Casino seem like they would be a kitschy throwback, but instead are satisfying and inspired.Aloette Fries will put any poutine to shame.Finally, the lovely snails... nestled in baby greens with pork belly and king oyster mushrooms--they were joyous! Excellent with a glass of the Greek varietal that is offered for $10/glass. Ridiculous pairing!The wine list is playful and impressive with several less known varietals for decent prices.Charmed and Overwhelmed.",4.0,5.0,52,2017-10-20,43.648539,-79.395937,"French , Bistros , Diners"
Aloette,"It's tough to get a table at this busy place. But it's totally worth the effort. The place has decor like it's food.

Aloette,"Aloette is one of my favourite restaurants in all of Toronto right now. I have been to Alo (located upstairs, owned by the same chef Patrick Kriss) and while I enjoyed the tasting menu there, the experience was a bit too intimate and the service a bit too attentive for me! In my opinion, Aloette offers equally delicious food and equally stellar service in a much more relaxed environment.They don't take reservations so it's first come, first serve for everyone. I came with my fiance on a Wednesday night around 6PM and we were lucky to get two seats at the bar right away. The place quickly filled up within the next 15-20 minutes! We got a gin and tonic and one of the cocktails, the balsam spritz. They give everyone cheesy bread with whipped yeast butter on the house to start. This was soo good! Definitely top 2 best breads I've ever had. For food, we shared the charred chorizo, burgundy snails, and the aloette burger. The chorizo and snails were such unique and flavourful dishes - I would suggest giving both of these a try. The burger was a bit more generic (although it did come with fried cheese) but it was still tasty. It came with a very generous portion of fries which tasted okay - we usually don't leave any fries behind but we were so full that we couldn't finish the whole plate even between the two of us.Highly, highly recommend. I can't wait to try the other items on their menu.",4.0,5.0,52,2017-11-11,43.648539,-79.395937,"French , Bistros , Diners"
Chadwick’s,"The restaurant is pretty small and very popular, so I recommend going early. We had to wait for a seat (I think we were there around 11:30-12 on a Sunday), but it wasn't too bad, I expected a longer wait. The seating is a bit squished, so be prepared to get comfortable with your neighbours. The service was courteous and friendly and the vibe is casual/hipster. I tend to prefer more space while I eat, but as soon as my food came, I stopped caring because it was 100% worth it. I got the eggs benedict with brisket and potatoes. It was amazing! Every single bite was packed with rich, delicious flavour. It was the perfect amount of brisket to bread/egg ratio and my egg was delightfully runny. I don't know what they put on their potatoes but it was like crack.Definitely ask for hot sauce on the side, but only if you REALLY like spice. The server said ""be careful, it's super hot"" and I was thinking ""hah, sure ooookay,"" but it actually was really spicy, so be aware and don't scoff like I did!",4.0,5.0,153,2018-01-18,43.673524,-79.411871,"Canadian (New) , Comfort Food"
Chadwick’s,"Perrrrrfect timing. Walked in here around 1pm and the place, albeit small, had 9 seats open up for my large group. All of my group's dishes were ~$12 - 18/person + drinks and gratuity. Teas and drinks were decently priced, I think my entire table got something.I got the Brisket Hash and all I remember is having a lot of potatoes on my plate ($16). This was a splurge considering how much money we spent on this mini vacation, but wasn't really worth it to me. I think another friend got a $12 plate and that seemed more worth it.Drinks had to be ordered first because of whatever process the restaurant has set up. This made ordering insanely slow and a bit awkward. Also, the restaurant runs out of dishes halfway through the day, so I would recommend coming here early if you're craving something.

TBH, I didnt really like the popcorn, it was missing that CRUNCH, texture was a bit on the stale/soggy side... but everything else was good :) HOWEVER... not sure if I liked the whole combination in this dish...I mean everything tasted good on its own, but I didn't think everything went well together, maybe someone else loves it?Overall: Great food and great service in general, definitely a good brunch spot!",4.0,4.0,153,2017-12-21,43.673524,-79.411871,"Canadian (New) , Comfort Food"

There aren't an overwhelming number of food options which I like, but they have a build your own benny for more options (price can add up quick though). I had the drowned omelette my last time here, which was good and had a lot of strong flavours. They'll also give you hot sauce on the side, which really kicks it up a notch.

It was a freezing that day and my 2 girlfriends and I got seated right at the back corner table - it was snug, but we were warm and appreciated the extra seating for our purses #girlproblems. We started off with coffee and water. Coffee was quite good. But this was where I found the service lacked. Typically, water or coffee is refilled or you are at least asked if you want to refill. But ours never was. We waved the servers a couple of times to ask for a refill and finally on the 3rd request they got back to us. The restaurant was busy but refilling drinks seems like a natural thing to do at a restaurant from a servers perspective. Maybe it's different here? Of everything on the menu, I was trying to decide between The Lonely Burger or Rancheros. I ended up with the Rancheros. It was perfect - light but filling and delicious for my 5'3 athletic appetite. The beans and the runny egg were a great combination together. Even with the slow service, I'd go again to give it a second and possibly even third try.

Chadwick’s,"Local, comfort food with a bit of an Asian influence in this cozy Annex abode.We started with the Mac & Cheese, which was served in a bowl of elbow macaroni swimming in cheese sauce and garnished with crispy shallots. This wasn't your basic Kraft dinner but it did have the nostalgia of eating it as a kid. The sauce was VERY saucy with a watery consistency. We kind of wished we had bread to dip in the sauce because there was that much sauce!We were kind of glad we split the starter three-ways and didn't order a second starter as the mashups we ordered were rather large.I ordered the Smoked Beef Brisket Mashup, which was served on a bed of mashed potatoes topped with a cilantro salad and garnished with fried garlic and shallots. Alternatively, you can order your mashup as a poutine or lettuce wrap. For $17, it is a rather larger portion; big enough to go halfsies or pack up for take-out. The creamy mashed potatoes are not side order portion and is just as much the star of the dish as the brisket. The brisket is cut in chunky pieces and there's a generous portion of the brisket as well. All in all, a delicious and filling meal.Sadly, we did not have room for dessert but it'll have to wait for a future visit.Had it not been for You Gotta Eat Here, I would not have ventured in this part of the Annex. We went for a late dinner on Tuesday night so it was rather quiet with a few patrons having dinner and drinks. Unfortunately, they didn't have anything that was featured on the show (Lamb Shepherd's Pie, Tourtiere Turnover, or Polenta).

The dishes are Asian inspired with an American twist. Every dish is really creative, tasty and made to perfection. The staff are nice and friendly. I had the following dishes and would absolutely order these items again:Smashed cucumber:  this cold dish is similar to what you can get at all Koreans restaurants with it's own twist of peanuts and black sesame. If you like this dish at your local favourite Korean restaurant then this still worth a try.Kare trippa: this was my favourite dish of the night! Tripe simmered in a curry sauce served with toast. The tripe was the melt in your mouth kind of softness and extremely tasteful. Even the toast alone was good.Katsu: porkshop served with a peppercorn sauce and cabbage salad. The porkchop was really crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The meat is not dry at all.Corn: I normally don't order corn at a restaurant but I am glad I gave this a try. This dish is served off the cob and the corn is sweet (the perfect kind of sweet for a good corn) with kimchi and feta cheese. Ssam: Korean bar snack called bossam. The steak was tender and melts in your mouth. SO GOOD!Parisian gnocchi: a twist of European made with oxtail sauce. Such an unique dish. I also had the tomatoes and the egg. Unfortunately, I do not remember the names of these items. The tomatoes and egg were really good especially for something as simple as these items.

Uncle Mikey’s,"My husband and I just got back after one of the best meals we've had in an incredibly long time. Uncle Mikey's is a great date spot, with a relaxed and unpretentious ambiance, very attentive and friendly service, a soild drink list, and really tasty food.We split the soy egg and onigiri to start, both of which were delicious, then we each had kimchi rice bowls -- his with pork belly, mine with tofu. Yeah, we could have had different dishes, but honestly, these were so good that we would have probably ordered a second one anyway. The kimchi, crispy onions, and pickled cucumber were the absolute perfect mix. Add rice and a little sriracha and you have something that's light enough but still satisfying and probably equally appealing in the dead of summer or on a cold winter night.For dessert, we had the ice cream with crispy rice and the grilled pineapple with lime, mint, and meringue. I don't remember the ice cream flavour, but it was a little caramel-ish without being overwhelming, and the topping added just the right amount of crunch. That said, the pineapple was probably the winner. It was just so fresh and simple, but also really memorable.We're so happy to have Uncle Mikey's in the neighbourhood. Everything on the menu looks incredible and we can't wait to go back and try more. It's closed tomorrow and Monday, but maybe Tuesday?

Jatujak,"I rarely come to this area so I never thought I'd get to try this restaurant.  I saw it while passing by and thought, I'm just gonna go!  I had a lunch special with the $3 add on (I really enjoyed my ginger tea).  The dressing on the salad was a little heavy handed and spread to my spring roll.  Boooo.  My rice noodles were great!  Full flavours and definitely reminded me of Thailand.  I asked for spicy and they did not disappoint.  I will admit, I wasn't too fond of having to pick out the pieces kaffir lime leaves but they certainly added to the taste.  Overall, a nice uptown option for Thai.",4.0,4.0,208,2018-01-19,43.736122,-79.307335,"Food Delivery Services , Thai"

Jatujak,"Jatujak is one of my favourite Thai places to go to in the city.  It's located in a peculiar location: A strip mall just south of Lawrence and Victoria Park.  Despite this, once inside, you are welcomed into a quaint and decently spacious restaurant serving up some tasty and authentic Thai dishes.I've frequented Jatujak a number of times now and have tried their Mango Salad, Chicken Pad Thai, Khao Soi, Gaeng Masaman, Mango Sticky Rice, and Thai Iced Tea. The mango salad is served with red onions, cilantro, peppers, and a tangy vinagrette atop a crispy chip that kind of resembles a shrimp cracker.  Very appetizing and especially good when mangoes are in season.The chicken pad thai is sweet, salty, and tangy.  Just exactly what pad thai should taste like, at least to a westernized palette like mine.  Well-balanced portion of protein, noodles, bean sprouts, and peanuts.  Not too saucy and not too dry.  If chicken is not your flavour, there are other options for protein, such as beef, shrimp, etc...The Khao soi features crispy egg noodles in a rich yellow curry with your choice of protein.  Very hearty and flavourful.The Gaeng Masaman features a delicious curry with peanut, taramind sauce and onions with your choice of protein.  I had the beef to go with it and it was very good and filling.The mango sticky rice had a very nice, colourful presentation.  A must try and a perfect ending to a hearty meal.  Not too sweet, and a very pleasant texture.Finally, the Thai iced tea was good and refreshing.  It was a tad on the sweet side, though.All was prepared fresh and delicious.  For the price-point, it is definitely well worth it considering its downtown rivals cost more and offer longer wait times and poorer service.",4.0,5.0,208,2018-01-11,43.736122,-79.307335,"Food Delivery Services , Thai"

Jatujak,"I love Thai food and I absolutely love Jatujak thai food! Everything here tasted amazing!!! It's hard to find a resto where I thoroughly enjoyed every single dish. Starting with the shrimp chips, super crispy and sooo good with the peanut sauce that came with it. The mango salad was perfectly seasoned, not too spicy. The tom yum soup was very flavourful, perfect on cold days like today. We also ordered the curry puff and I would highly recommend it. On to the main dishes, I think we almost ordered everything on the menu.  If I haven't stress enough, I loved everything but my favourite was the green curry and the basil eggplant wth tofu. For dessert, the mango sticky rice was warm, moist and uber delicious! Best way to finish a meal. The service was great, all the dishes came out fast.

Jatujak,"Jatujak is a mid-town Scarborough Thai restaurant located in a small plaza that's easy to pass by unnoticed. If you are heading south on Victoria Park, it's almost an immediate right turn after Sweeney Drive.This restaurant is not big so making reservations might be beneficial, but you can also walk in casually, just expect to wait a bit especially if you have a large group. We came on a Saturday night once as a group of 4 and 90% of the tables had a reserve sign on. Thankfully my friends worked their magic to somehow secure a table.Compare to downtown Thai restaurants, I enjoyed Jatujak very much. Their portion size and flavours were great. Its hard to find good Thai cuisine nowadays.My boyfriend ordered the Pad Thai with Chicken (+$1). Personally, I thought it was super delicious with a hint of sweetness and sourness together. I can't describe how delicious it was. Too bad it wasn't my order. However, my BF felt the Pad Thai had less fish sauce flavour than needed.As for my dish, I had the Khao Soi with Chicken and asked for less spicy. The noodles were great and the served amount was perfect, unlike some places that gave less noodles yet with a big bowl of soup. The sauce is awesome too - not too thick, spice level mild and just right, and the aroma was fantastic. I did notice there were a lot of onions cooked in this Khao Soi, not sure if it's like that or they added it to make it more original. Overall, I thought the chicken meat was least satisfying. It was decent and thinly sliced but nothing special.Another dish our group ordered was a curry masan. The sauce was different than your typical curry or the Khao Soi. It was really tasty and interestingly, I noticed they filled the rice bowl to the max, almost spilling the sauce inside.Just to fill my taste buds with more Thai flavour, I ordered the Nom Ye green milk (thinking it was Thai-styled iced tea). It tasted like Melona Popsicles haha. It was another visit that I finally tried their iced tea and it was refreshing!Come dessert time, we ordered the Mango Sticky Rice which was really well done. The presentation was excellent being multicolored. Although different  in colour, they all taste identical - the warmth and sweetness, accompanied with just the right amount of syrup. Likewise, the mango wasn't sour yet everything on the plate was chewy.In general, Jatujak service was good. The waitress was smiling and kind, and she also helped take a group picture for us amidst the busyness. They refilled the water jar consistently and didn't rush us to pay or leave either.",4.0,4.0,208,2017-12-14,43.736122,-79.307335,"Food Delivery Services , Thai"
Jatujak,"Decided to pop in here as i was craving a Thai iced-tea and well, food went hand in hand with it.Decided to order two separate dishes, a curry and a pad thai and both were delicious. The serving was the perfect size and the peanut sauce on the side was even better.The curry could have had a little bit more flavour/spice to it but other than that it was good!Definitely recommend the Thai iced-tea it was once of the best i have had!",4.0,4.0,208,2017-12-04,43.736122,-79.307335,"Food Delivery Services , Thai"
Jatujak,"When you first step in, there are about 5-6 small tables, but they have a larger room that you can enter once inside the restaurant. We had about 12 people in our dinner party and there was 2 other groups of the same size. Just call ahead to make a reservation for big groups.Last but not least, the food is goals. In terms of Thai food standards, they have won based on their khao soi, green curry, pad thai, pad see eew, and holy basil with egg. Don't worry, I'm not a hype girl so I can be honest with what I didn't like. I wouldn't recommend the fried rice (too plain), crispy chicken (not enough flavor), or mango sticky rice (looks pretty but doesn't taste like much). Also, the Thai iced tea looks pretty, but is hella sweet. It's pre-made so they can't change that but do try it! If anything, you have a pretty picture for the gram. In Scarborough standards this place is 6 stars out of 5. Perfect for family when celebrating a special occasion or even for date night. I've been here countless of times since I discovered it and would go back again!!",4.0,5.0,208,2017-12-10,43.736122,-79.307335,"Food Delivery Services , Thai"
Jatujak,"This most recent visit to Jatujak was our second time in over a year and we all left the restaurant very full and satiated. Since my first visit, they seem to have opened additional dining space which is attractively decorated, spacious, and great for larger groups. We ordered mango salad, which was served in an interesting fried crispy cracker like shell. The mango salad was fresh, savoury, and refreshing. We also ordered Thai iced teas, chicken penang curry, beef massuman curry, mango crispy chicken, and pad thai. All of the dishes we ordered were flavourful and generously portioned. The curries and crispy chicken were served with small bowls of rice. In my opinion, the pad thai at Jatujak is better than the pad thai at sister restaurant Kub Khao as Kub Khao's version is too sweet for my taste. Not to mention that the shrimp pad thai came with very large, nicely cooked pieces of shrimp. This latest visit was better than our first experience at Jatujak the year they first opened as they did not have air conditioning on that hot summer day and the chicken in our curry had an off-putting taste, as though it was not fresh. Thankfully all of our dishes tasted great this time around. We probably over-ordered for the 5 of us in our party but at least hubby and I had enough leftovers for another meal or two! Sadly we were too stuffed to order dessert but I hear they have a colourful and delicious mango sticky rice.

Jatujak,"Great alternative to its downtown counterparts. Second time visiting Jatujak, pretty much made a similar order to my first dine in. - vegetable spring rolls - would skip not worth $6.00 imo - Jatujak pad thai - shrimp - Gaeng karee / red curry - shrimp - extra white rice - extra lime for the pad thai - side of hot sauce - would recommend, not your typical white packet hot sauce  Pricing to a small degree is higher than surrounding locations but the taste, quality, and consistency is there. You can definitely taste the various flavors especially the coconut milk. Good quantity of large shrimp. Overall you will have an enjoyable meal. The staff are great, and the overall restaurant is quick on their feet. You can either go downtown, pay for parking, and wait in line. Or you can go here which is conveniently located in the GTA ( depending on where you live ), with equal or better tasting food.

Jatujak,"[4.5 star] Jatujak is my favourite go-to Thai restaurant.  Despite being located in a sketchy strip mall, the restaurant is very clean and beautifully decorated with hand-drawn chalkboard art. Its interior atmosphere is perfect for casual date nights. Don't be fooled by the small storefront as there's another seating area tucked at the back of the restaurant; great for seating larger groups. Service was good and food was excellent. All main dishes are reasonably priced at around $10-13 (additional $1 or $2 depending on your choice of protein). Very generous with their portions, especially the added protein, for both dine-in and take-out orders. - Both the Geang Kiew Whan (green curry) and the Geang Karee (yellow curry) was rich in flavour and packed with protein and veggies. All curry comes with steamed jasmine rice. I would definately recommend the green curry if you like the extra kick of heat. - The chicken Pad Thai is very standard, but is cooked very well. It has a balanced, sweet yet tangy flavour. Noodles were not overcooked and had a nice bounce. - Mango salad is served on a crispy shell-like chip. This dish is very tasty and refreshing. Although already near perfect, I'd prefer no raw onions and cilantro added in the salad.  - The yellow curry used in the chicken Khao Soi is delicious and flavourful. However, unlike other resraurants, there was significantly more protein served in comparison to the egg noodle. - Thai iced tea is served in a cute mason jar. As usual, too sweet for my liking. - The mango sticky rice dessert is served warm, and often in a heart shape. The tri-colour sticky rice (no difference in taste) and mango is topped with toasted sesame seeds, and is paired with a not overly sweet syrup. This dessert is definitely a must try becuase it is both delicious and picture worthy. I would definitely recommend Jatujak, a Scarborough hidden gem.",4.0,4.0,208,2018-01-02,43.736122,-79.307335,"Food Delivery Services , Thai"

Also large, bright and airy. Service here is *quick*. The food was good as well. The portions are pretty big, and the prices are reasonable.We got some spring rolls, tom kha soup, a pad thai and a fish curry. Flavour wise, everything was good! The fish was wrapped in some leaves, and presumably was steam cooked. It was pretty interesting. I think it was a little over cooked, but I still enjoyed it! As mentioned, the portions were large, so we had plenty to take home for my lunch the next day =)I also had a thai iced tea, which was good as well.

Jatujak,"Let me be clear, the chief reason for my visit is so my girlfriend could get her hands on the extremely photo-worthy mango sticky rice. That aside, Jatujak is a charmingly low-key restaurant with chalk-drawings of the food on the wall, wallprints of traditional Thai figures, and a large flag of Thailand on another wall.As it follows with my bad habits at a new restaurant, I over-order to edge out a little more on variety, getting the pad kee mao, khao soi, curry steamed fish, chicken wings, Thai iced teas, and the mango sticky rice. Overall my impression was that flavours were authentic; good heat and fragrance. Surprisingly, my favourite was the steamed fish curry. Served in a banana leaf basket, it was like a delicate and fragrant omelet with a bowlful of rice and some orange slices for garnish---a pleasant contrast from the oiliness and sauciness of our other choices. That pad kee mao was also a standout, with decently sized juicy and flavourful shrimp, and reasonably (and satisfyingly) greasy fried noodles and veggies (as if pad thai and 乾炒牛河 had a well-behaved lovechild). I initially felt the Thai iced teas were overwhelmed by condensed milk (my girlfriend comments that it does not live up to the real thing), with the much desired tea flavour arriving weakly in the aftertaste. However, sipping on this in between bites and dishes, I found it was more than suitable as a palate cleanser and a ground to which to return from heat---acceptable.The mango sticky rice was indeed beautiful as my esteemed fellow Yelpers have captured before. Not being a fan myself, I found it a mildly sweet finisher of appropriate portion size and excellently plated.

This is my first time to have Tom Kha soup. I like this creamy coconut flavour with a variety of Asian herbs I'm not able to name. Tom yum soup is also recommended. I prefer this one to PAI. Right, for the appetizer I ordered a shrimp chips to share with my friends. The sauce coming with the shrimp chips tastes awesome!

The noodle was clumped together so had to be separated before eating and obviously I made a mess (sorry!).

Jatujak,"We moved to the area recently, and I'm happy to have found a good Thai place. I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Décor: 4/5We came here on a weekday. So the place was busy, but not crazy. We got seated right away. The place is actually bigger than I expected with the first room, leading to a second bigger room. The restaurant can fit quite a lot of people. The second room has better lighting than the first room. I liked the way place is decorated with the cool mural on the wall and the umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. The room had a modern feel to it with the high ceiling and concrete walls.Service: 3/5Overall the service is a bit slow, but the food is good.Food: 4/5We ordered the satay beef for an appetizer, which was nice and soft and had a nice flavour to it. While it was good, it wasn't my favourite dish of the night.For mains we also ordered the Jatujak pad thai with shrimp, which I really enjoyed. The sauce had a nice balance to it, and I'm glad that it didn't have a ketchup taste to it that some pad thai's can have. The shrimps were nicely sized and they give you quite a few. The noodles were cooked perfectly. The portion sizes are pretty big and if you ordered this for one person you would be very satisfied. The highlight of the meal for me was the dessert. For dessert we got the mango stick rick, which was delicious. Presentation for this was cute laid out is a heart. The colourful rice was nice, warm, and well cooked. The sauce that comes with it is pretty sweet, but balances well with the sour tang of the mango. It's very filling and I would recommend sharing it between two or even three people, especially if you carb loaded on your main meal.

Big Crow,"Big Crow offers one of the most unique dining experiences in the city. Tucked behind the Rose and Sons diner, Big Crow is nestled in a small shed at the end of a dark alleyway. Upon entering, the place has a warm, cabin-like atmosphere - marked by log benches, heavy wood tables, and a cozy feel. We ordered the mac-n-cheese ($11) to start. It was clear that Big Crow's chef likes to keep things interesting, putting a small twist on traditional classics. The mac-n-cheese itself was more of a cream sauce macaroni pasta, as it was lacking some stick. The bread crumbs and parsley sprinkled on top added a nice touch. As a main, we shared the baby back ribs ($39), chicken drums ($16), hunter's sausage ($16), and a side of potato salad ($6).The ribs were smoked to perfection. The cherry tomato and basil pesto toppings were interesting. Not my first choice for rib seasoning, but it was a nice change from the standard BBQ. Chicken drums were spectacular. The Alabama style white BBQ sauce drizzled on top added a tangy finish. The hunters sausage platter with sauerkraut and dijon was perfect for sharing. This is the right dish to pick if you're a sausage lover. Oh ya - the potato salad was also delicious :) We finished off with the sticky toffee pudding and it may have been the best dish of the night. Perfect way to end the meal.

Use your nose and follow the sweet scent of smokey meat. Yes, the prices are a bit steep but the portions are large. A full rack of ribs plus one side was enough for 2 people. But if you are super hungry or want to splurge, get more by all means. Without drinks, the bill ended up being $75 with tax and tip---yeah, not cheap!The ribs were nice and flavourful but I still think Barque is better! Sorry! Our Cesar salad was good too, but nothing special.

Big Crow,Went here with a few friends and although initially their was some confusion to the location we found it tucked away behind a funky looking hamburger joint. Walking towards the entrance you instantly catch the wiff of burning wood and gets the mind thinking of  all the delicious meat that is cooking.The server was instantly awesome finding us 5 of us space without having a reservation and believe me this place does have a constant flow of people.Initially looking to get dishes individually she again came up trumps and advised us to share dishes and get one each. We went a few dishes further and got most the main items.The Salmon poke was great and just the write amount of salmon and not drowned too much in whatever it was. The chicken drums were kind of dry and did not care much for those. The Korean ribs were awesome as was the full rack of ribs we got. Those had to be my two fav dishes. For 5 of us it came to a decent overall price so definitely worth the time and money to go to this location.,4.0,5.0,133,2016-10-19,43.675718,-79.403566,"Canadian (New) , Barbeque"

Located in a barn like setting, Big Crow gives you the feel of being in a classic French Canadian sugar shack.

They have a set menu for 35$ which includes: 2 appetizers (salad and cheese bread), 1 main course (ribs, chicken, and few others I forgot), plus a small dessert.

The reuben sandwich - huge slices of meat, soft bread, the grainy mustard ties all the flavours togetherThe dirty bird - so tender and flavourfulA couple a nods:The frito pie - basically your Taco Bell fries supreme toppings on Fritos.

The broccoli - got a nice kick to it and a nice change from all the meat entrees A couple of no-nosKetchup chips - it's Covered Bridge ketchup chips and served in a bag for $11. Not worth the money. Baked beans - nothing fancy here. Could definitely do without it. It's nice to go with a group of 5-6 so you can try a few dishes. Cocktails were delicious too. I tried a few of them and you can't go wrong with any. It all depends what you're in the mood for. They range between $10-14",4.0,4.0,133,2015-12-07,43.675718,-79.403566,"Canadian (New) , Barbeque"
Big Crow,"My husband and I were so looking forward to a delicious meal as Big Crow is hailed as one of the best BBQ restaurants in Toronto. We eat out quite often and in comparison to some of the other BBQ joints in the city, we were very confused at why most of the reviews were so positive. We ordered the Corn bread, Mac N Cheese, and a full rack of ribs. We saved room for dessert, but after seeing that each dish was so mediocre, we didn't bother with ordering dessert.The ribs: the middle few pieces were juicy, but for the most part the ribs were dry inside and out (as it was only a dry rub). I like hipster places and thought the cabin was very cute, but for the 3 dishes plus a drink, the bill came to $84.

Cluny Bistro & Boulangerie,"Note: This review is only for the boulangerie. I came here during the Christmas market and was intrigued by it's patterned foyer. One thing for sure: the people who decorated this place sure knew what they were doing. To the left, to the left, the bou-lan-ge-rie is in the room to the left. This is a French pastry shop that is in front of the Bistro. It was a warm tiny shop with a pretty good system in place from the door for crowd-control reasons I suppose - one way in, one way out. What caught my eye were the croissants and then the tiny French pastries just beside the cashier ($3.5). Of course, I went with the Mocha Éclair because why would I get a croissant? Maybe next time as a way to compare with the croissants at other places and Pillsbury ones. The pastry was smaller than the palm of my hand. Although it was not big in size, the looks made up for it (I promise I'm not always this shallow). Overall, my experience was very pleasant as soon as I stepped into the shop and when I left.

Straight ahead the double doors will lead you to the restaurant. Overall, I enjoyed my experience here. The decor was probably my favorite, there were lights from the light tunnel right in front of me, the ceiling had beautiful wood detailing. Now on to the food. I tried the fried asparagus which surprised me, it was phenomenal! We ordered a second portion. The burger is totally Instagramable! So it's a cumbrae's beef burger with braised wagu beef and a whole slab of fried cheese. Sounds amazing right? well the burger was a little bit too thick in my onion and a bit overdone, the wagu beef ontop was delicious! Once you pressed down on the bun, a flow of melted cheese comes oozing out, what's left is a hard and overpowering cheese residue that I didn't enjoy. Also very very very messy!

Cluny Bistro & Boulangerie,"On a recommendation from a friend, we ended up here for a late breakfast while enjoying the Christmas market. There were five of us, including a three year and it was freezing outside. We got there at roughly 10:30 and there was a huge lineup. Apparently they had just opened so we were told 20-25 minutes and that they would send us a text. We walked around. Enjoyed a couple of tantrums and then got back to the resto. At about the 40 minute mark we were led to our seat and ended up in the bar area. The omelette selection is apparently pretty rigid. There is the one of the day and one other one. They are not big on substitutions. We ordered a breakfast sandwich and a farmers platter. The sandwich was very good. The farmers platter was good although not as good as I was expecting for $25. One plus is that they have their own bakery and bake their own breads, etc.  We did ask for another bread basket but it mysteriously never showed up!  My cappuccino was made with almond milk, which I am glad they had and was decent. The servers were all fine. No issues there. The decor makes you feel like if you were in some cosmopolitan European city. I'll go with Paris. So overall, a decent spot. Perhaps a little pricey for what you get.  It was a little hectic when we were there.

Cluny Bistro & Boulangerie,"It has been a while since I have dined at Cluny, and I am very happy to say that the offerings here have improved with the recent arrival of their new executive chef Murray McDonald.Being at The Distillery district, it is understandable that some people would think the prices are a bit inflated. Even so, I would argue that it is not by much. True, the food here is pricey compared to what you get at Mill St Brewpub just right next door, but you get what you pay for and the food is at a totally different caliber. The decor here is extremely gorgeous, with a large outdoor patio, cosy bar area and a large dining room with a seafood station and a bread station.For our visit, we had a large seafood platter - with whole lobster, a cluster of snow crab legs, oysters, mussels, clams, a plate of diced salmon with guacamole and escargot. It was definitely the star of our dinner there given how large and impressive this platter was. There was even dry ice in the middle and we were wonderfully entertained by the smoke that came out when water was poured down into it.The bone marrow starter was wonderfully different than others I have had given that it was topped with escargot and was extremely tasty. The goat cheese and fig was simply delicious and I would highly recommend it.The Peruvian ceviche was a delight and colourful to look at, but was a slight miss given that it was perhaps a tad over-salted. The gazpacho was light, refreshing and a get way to get your appetite going.We had the char broiled octopus as a shared main dish, which IMO was a steal at $27.50 with other places charging as much as $60 for a similar portion. It could be a tad more tender, but I enjoyed it a lot nonetheless.For dessert, we had a chocolate bomb which is cracked in front of you revealing a mango/passionfruit sorbet inside, along with chocolate sauce mixed with berries and pop rocks. I thought the pop rocks made the dessert interesting, and it was definitely neat to watch the shell crack open. But unless you are a huge chocolate fan with a lot of diners with you, I would perhaps not order this given how large it is.Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Cluny immensely, and would definitely visit again.",3.0,5.0,379,2017-07-18,43.650588,-79.357896,"French , Wine Bars , Cocktail Bars"

Cluny Bistro & Boulangerie,"Made a reservation here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and decided to try out the summerlicious menu. The decor is quite interesting and definitely unique, but I felt a bit cluttered and it was quite dark. They could probably use more fabric to break down the noise levels. With glass and tiling everywhere and he vast open space, I think it amplifies the noise level quite a bit. My boyfriend started off with a seafood chowder. I thought the broth base was quite nice and very flavourful. There's quite a variety of seafood in the dish so that was nice to enjoy. I had the swordfish ceviche. I am a sucker for seafood and i love acidity and freshness of ceviches. I was not disappointed with this dish at all. They did an amazing job with the swordfish slices and there's a crispy shrimp cracker to pair it with. I love that the sauce was very acidic and they had some fresh greens over top. There are dollops of guacamole that help break that acidity down and bring a new layer of flavour to each bite. I enjoyed it very much! The mains were not quite as impressive sadly to say. I had the chicken cordon bleu crepe topped with a poached egg which was paired with a very large side of slaw. I really liked the salad and again, the flavouring was on point. The chicken was sadly bland, but mixed with the slaw, crepe, yolk, ham and blue cheese, it was a nice meal. My boyfriend had sirloin which came with brussel sprouts and layered baked/roasted turnip. The vegetable sides were very well caramelized and flavourful. But the steak itself was rather plain and had no seasoning. It seams they do an all star job with the sides but really neglected the proteins. I guess we had different stars to our dishes that night. The desserts were interesting. I had the honey butter cake which tasted like a home made lemon cake I use to make. It was really quite delicious and I loved the cake texture. They put a yogurt gelato on top which brought in some tart flavour. And around the cake they had these lemon custard drops which were tart and I thought paired nicely with the sweet cake. My boyfriend had the tiramisu like cake or truffle chocolate bar. It was topped with some basil I believe, and it tasted quite nice. It was a bit sweet for my taste but that's milk chocolate for you. Service was nice. Our wait for the food was a bit lengthy but not to the point where it would be anything negative. I guess it's worth it because they do take the time to present the food nicely on the plate, and that can affect how it will taste as well. Our server was Alice and she was very attentive and friendly and she was there enough to check up on us but left us our space to enjoy our date night :)I would want to come back and try more of their main menu and brunch as well.

Cherry Street Bar-B-Que,"A great spot for BBQ, ribs and hanging out on the patio (if you can find a spot). We came on a summer night and the weather was perfect for sitting outside. At night, they have pretty patio lights that make the space very intimate and welcoming. Also, there is bar conveniently situated outside for easy access to cold drinks and cocktails. The food is delicious and you can tell they took a long time smoking and cooking their various meat options. The prices are comparable to eating at a restaurant in central downtown, with a sandwich floating around the $11 mark. The ribs are on the more expensive side ($21 for half rack, $42 for full), but they are generous with their portions and worth a try. The restaurant location is a little bit of a hike, especially for those using the TTC. It's by the lower Donlands, at the very end of Cherry Street. I don't know what you would be doing here, unless you were going to Cirque or the nearby T&T.",4.0,3.0,96,2017-11-24,43.645459,-79.352504,Barbeque
Cherry Street Bar-B-Que,"The food here is pretty tasty and is well priced. Before alcohol, probably less than $40 total would get you stuffed. Similar to other BBQ places, you order first and find a table to eat at. Its generally pretty busy, especially when the patio is not open; it may be hard to find a table. We came once in the middle of summer and it was easy to find a seat inside. Came back again in the fall and the inside dining area is packed. The brisket is fine. Tasty, but definitely not the best I've had. The pulled pork was okay, but would not get again. Their sides are all amazing tho, especially the potatoes. We've come back here just for the potatoes. If you don't mind walking for 4-5 minutes, there is lots of street parking around the corner.",4.0,4.0,96,2017-11-07,43.645459,-79.352504,Barbeque
Cherry Street Bar-B-Que,"This restaurant is opposite to the Big Top for Cirque du Soleil.  Therefore, it's a convenient option for show-goers. It's a little hard to get to if you're not already in the area, however.  For all you TTC riders, I hope you will be able to board the 72 bus at Pape Station instead of finding the 72 bus stop around Harbourfront.  I was surprised at how far apart the bus stops were and how few people in that area could pinpoint the stop's location for me. Ambiance-wise, you will enjoy this place if you are used to the loud, casual pub scene. The tables are placed close to one another, so you're sure to hear your neighbour's conversation and thus have problems hearing your own. I actually like the loud pub scene while having a few drinks, but my company didn't like struggling to hear our conversation. Despite the positive Yelp reviews, I was sadly disappointed with the food.  Price-wise, I found the items to be on the more expensive side even though several Yelpers hailed the restaurant for its affordability. This opinion was mainly based on the fact that you have to pay separately for the sides, each of which cost anywhere between 5-7 dollars.  Also, the menus are handwritten on the walls, so I am sure the prices change depending on the market. We ordered the brisket, mac and cheese, and the sausage in a bun. The mac and cheese was a clear winner for us that night. It was creamy and had a deep, rich flavour.  On the other hand, the brisket was unbearably dry.  They serve the brisket with two slices of white bread and a side of onions, pickles and pepper, but the brisket's dryness was emphasized when sandwiched between these ingredients. Lastly, the sausage in a bun could have been a winner if the sausage wasn't so salty. You know the Costco hot dogs? It was saltier than those! Unfortunately, two hours after eating here, my company and I both got stomach aches. We didn't eat anything after leaving the restaurant, so we suspect that the restaurant did not prepare our food properly....Overall, we will not be returning.  We will most likely opt to get our munchies fix at the nearby T&T Supermarket.",4.0,1.0,96,2017-11-10,43.645459,-79.352504,Barbeque
Cherry Street Bar-B-Que,"I can count on 2 fingers the amount of times I've been to Cherry and Commissioners in my life.  One of those fingers includes this review so no, this is definitely not an area I frequent often.  I have been to the Southernmost Point marker in Key West more than I've been over the bridge on Cherry Street in my life.It was one of those days where I take the entire day off and spend it eating and drinking with a fellow Yelper and when the day ends at Cherry Street BBQ for the last meal of the day I can say that it was topped off properly.  We had a light late lunch That went well into the 3pm time of the afternoon.  Thankfully it was light and on the way down from Greenwood and Gerrard we hit up a 3 places to grab a drink along the way.  Cherry Street BBQ was going to be the last stop and everything leading up to it just complimented the meal even more but even without going to the other places this BBQ joint had it going on.  Did I know it even existed?  No, I did not.  If not for my friend that decided this was a place we were going to check out I would never have even known because as I said, I pretty much never go to this area of town, ever.Stranger in a strange part of town I suppose.  It was like being a tourist for a day without having to travel.  This place that felt completely new to me was something I never knew of so it was going to be a complete surprise.  We ended up eating on the patio because the weather was nice.  You have to get in line and order inside and then  you get a number with a stand to take to your table where they will in turn bring out your order to you.  The menu on the wall gives quite a few options for straight up BBQ or some sandwich versions of meat between bread.  For the meat options (what we were interested in) it pretty much had all pricing in half pound increments.  Essentially you'd be paying by the half pound for say ribs (3 bones), brisket, sausage (which equates to a single sausage) or for the ribs they were also available in half and full racks.  There were 3 of us so I tried to order accordingly.  We decided upon a full pound of brisket, a half rack of ribs (6 bones), and a single sausage.  It seemed like an appropriate amount for 3 of us.  The platter came out and they included some sliced bread  (normal thickness, not Texas toast thick slices) and it all looked really good.  The sausage we simply cut up for sharing.  It seemed either very fatty or we weren't even sure if there was cheese inside it was hard to say.  The casing kept it together until we started to slice is up and it became somewhat crumbly.  The sausage I think was quite salty but I loved that about it.  My wife would have certainly found it far too salty for her liking but it was really flavorful and savory just eating it on its own.  The ribs were unlike any ribs I've had before.  The meat almost seemed as if it was cured because it had the look of dry ham but it almost looked like the color of bacon.  Those are two areas of the pig not necessarily related to ribs at all.  The ribs were dry and almost red in color but fully cooked.  The meat seemed to almost chip off but it still stuck to the bones.  The best description I can use to put into words is that ribs seemed to be ""candied cured"".  Not juicy, tasty but very different almost like jerky still on the bones... unusual but I liked them and ended up eating most of the ribs.The brisket however was downright delectable.  The rub on it rubbed me the right way.  It had kick but it was full of flavor, not overly spicy (for me) but so juicy and tender I probably could have chipped away with it with a plastic spoon.  I mean this brisket was simply melt in your mouth goodness.  I have to say it's probably the best I've ever had in my memory because it was just so juicy.  I'm so used to getting dry, tough brisket that it has to be smothered in sauce to lubricate the meat but not this serving.  I was completely wowed by the brisket, the juiciness, the seasoning and the texture.  For the shared meal for 3 which was the pound of to die for last meal on the planet kind of brisket, savory sausage and candied cured type ribs it came out to a bit over 60 bucks plus tip.  The pricing seemed a bit high for the portions but the quality as far as I was concerned was above and beyond quite a few BBQ places I've been to in my life all over the place including the deep south.  The brisket easily won me over, that I have no doubt.  We had issues with our BBQ sauce dispenser which was being able to squirt out the sauce.  Something kept plugging it up.  There was only one variety of sauce available as opposed to the half dozen you may see in places in the south.   Cherry Street BBQ is a well kept secret because of its seclusion to the rest of the city being in such an inconspicuous place and because of that it's probably one of best kept secrets in town.",4.0,5.0,96,2017-07-26,43.645459,-79.352504,Barbeque

Cherry Street Bar-B-Que,I went here on a weekday for dinner. Parking is very limited and no more parking on the side street. So I just park by T&T and walk over. Patios wasn't open due to raining weather. When entering I didn't expect it to be very small. You would go up and pay for what you like and they give you a number. Finding a seat was very difficult because allot of tables were reserved and there weren't many tables since the place is very small.  You would also have to go up to the bar and pay separately for your drinks.  I didn't like the layout.Food: I got the ribs and home fries and my bf got the brisket sandwich with mac n cheese. The ribs was good and had good seasoning but it wasn't the best I ever had. (3 slice of ribs) The brisket sandwich was very tasty! I would def recommend any meat on a bun and their home fries.  Mac n cheese was okay. Overall it's a really nice place with good sandwich but I wouldn't visit again since it wasn't worth it for me.,4.0,3.0,96,2017-07-15,43.645459,-79.352504,Barbeque
Cherry Street Bar-B-Que,"This place was on the radar for a while and given that I frequent T&T Supermarket nearby its an always on after thought after I get my har gow fix at their food court. The line ups are always a good sign but I guess this might be due to a dearth of a BBQ spot in this neighborhood. There were quite a few people sitting outside though there was no line up at the ordering counter. Hmm they could use an improvement here as someone would just pass by and say I would be with you in a min and just disappear. This went on for a bit till I got my order in. I stuck with the beef brisket (the beef rib wasn't available that day)  and ordered a side of mac & cheese on the side.  The order comes with a side of white bread and pickled items. Hmm I didn't enjoy the brisket as even though it was falling apart it was not seasoned to my liking. Maybe the sandwich would have fared better for this spot, I might come back here to try the beef rib otherwise 2.5 starsP.S.

Cherry Street Bar-B-Que,"Stopped in here with bae before watching the Cirque de Soliel show across the street (thanks Yelp!).When we arrived around 6pm, it was already very busy with almost no seats available. It seems most people grab take out from this location. They also have outdoor seating and they had heaters on when we visited but with temps dropping, I assume that portion won't be open much longer. We got lucky and found two stools open in the corner at the end of the bar. Decent beer selection and they also offer Jack Daniels' shots for $3.50. Side note, the highlight of the experience for sure was the bartender - a really nice dude! I'm not so much into meat these days (I guess I am more of a reduct-arian?) but there were a few veggie options to choose from. We ended up ordering the beef brisket, mac n' cheese, beans, coleslaw and a pulled pork sandwich. They give you a number that you take to your table, then deliver the food a short while later (came out fast).Bae enjoyed the meats, saying they were a-ok but nothing to write home about (ie not the best he'd ever had). I love love love mac n cheese and found this version to be sort of bland. Felt like it needed salt? Beans were good but our batch was super spicy and I don't mind heat. For the coleslaw, they do a vinegar based version. I am more of a creamy coleslaw gal but the tanginess of the slaw cut the heat of the beans nicely.Good choice if looking for a quick meal in the area.",4.0,3.0,96,2017-11-09,43.645459,-79.352504,Barbeque
Cherry Street Bar-B-Que,"Cherry Street Bar-B-Que only scored a 3 stars because for one big main reason: our food came just enough warm. By the time we were done with the first item, the rest was barely warm. Surely the flavour was good but to be honest, I was expecting something better when I compare this restaurant with other places I had the luck to visit south the border.We had brisket, side ribs, baby back ribs (1/2 rack) and half a chicken. To drink we had bourbon and lemonade and (I believe) 3 speeds by Amsterdam brewery.The brisket was really good while the ribs were just ok. Ribs, when are perfectly done, should come off the bone like butter. These, unfortunately, did not and by the time we started to bite into it, they were just slightly warm.The chicken tasted good but, being our third item to eat, it was totally cold by the time we got to it.The sides we had were the mac-n-cheese (o-k) and the coleslaw that was delicious, perfect to balance and settle down the ingestion of all the food.Overall the restaurant offers a menu with a wide choice of different cuts that should satisfy even the most picky meat eater.They have 2 smoke pits at the back.The setup is cool and the bartender was both knowledgeable and friendly. The drinks we had were without a doubt, a good suggestion by the bartender.Despite the Cherry Street Bar-B-Que is located in a beautiful and unique building, is a bit out of the way though and the parking may be... ""troublesome"".I will give this restaurant another shot just because the vast majority of the reviews are very good.",4.0,3.0,96,2017-08-06,43.645459,-79.352504,Barbeque
Cherry Street Bar-B-Que,"I really like Cherry Street BBQ; the atmosphere is right, the food is good, and the service is good. There's not much to dislike about this place. They serve up some good BBQ here.I came here with my partner on a Friday evening and the place wasn't all too busy. There was plenty of space indoors in the main hall with the majority of people sitting outside on the patio with live music. The atmosphere was lovely, you can see the Toronto skyline in the distance, and it was the perfect combination of liveliness and quaint-ness. You order at the counter, and the food comes to you after. Water is self serve, there's paper towels, and extra BBQ sauce at your table - it's all very convenient and everything was just right here. We went with 1/2 lb brisket, pulled pork with sides of potato salad and quinoa salad. It also came with some pickles, onions, jalapenos, and some slices of bread - which I really appreciate because it completed the meal. We were big fans of the pulled pork which was juicy and succulent although it was a tad on the salty side. The brisket on the other hand was a bit confusing. I'd say it was somewhat disappointing. It was definitely tender and broke down easily but was more dry than I expected - which masked a lot of qualities of the brisket. The flavor is much more subtle than the pulled pork which was good. I'm a really big fan of their BBQ sauce which has a really nice sweetness to it and ended up almost drinking it because it was just that good!The sides were also decent (especially the quinoa salad - a very good healthy option to make by the way!). It was really balanced with the ingredients in there but the potato salad on the other hand was more acidic than I expected. But I suppose when you eat everything together, it balances out. The portion size could have a been a bit better for the potato salad, but the quinoa is fine as it was packed.Overall I really like this place and would definitely recommend it if you're in the area.",4.0,3.0,96,2017-07-30,43.645459,-79.352504,Barbeque

Cherry Street Bar-B-Que,"Pros:MMMM, Meat!!Cons:Line ups can be longCame here after a day at Taiwanfest on the recommendation of a friend and was totally not disappointed!  It's hard to find BBQ places like this in general these days.  So to find one this good is always a blessing!As soon as you come in, you will basically walk right up into the line up.  It's that busy here.  You won't be assigned a seat here.  You come in, order, and then find any seat that's available.  There's a large patio outside and some seats with a bar inside.They have a pretty simple menu here but everything they do here, they do very well.  We came as a group of 4 with 3 children so we ordered a bunch of things to try them as much as possible. We ordered the brisket, side ribs, beef ribs turkey and a bunch of sides.  Just look at the pics I took.  Me trying to describe everything just wouldn't do it justice.  It's all done very well.  Even the mac and cheese and home fries are so good!!  The beef rib here is a mammoth piece of meat. There's no way around that, give it a whirl, you won't be disappointed.The service here is very friendly.  The servers go around chatting everyone up.  It's a very homey atmosphere here.  I was surprised to see how kid friendly this place was as well. We didn't have any trouble eating here with 3 children.  The music on the patio can be a bit loud though, so eating inside is the way to go if you have little ones with you.I love this place.  These places are few and far between so when you find a great one, it's a great feeling.  I'm definitely coming back whenever I'm in the area and feeling like BBQ.",4.0,5.0,96,2016-09-09,43.645459,-79.352504,Barbeque

Lao Thai Restaurant,"This is a tiny casual spot right in the same building as Metro on the corner of Queen and Gladstone.  It is quite easy to miss but it is right behind RBC.I visited for lunch based on pretty good yelp reviews.  I wanted to check it out for myself.  We were greeted by Liz, the friendly owner/chef/server.  Yes this is a family ran spot with just her and her mom.  The place is tiny with just about 20 seats.  She seated us right away.  Upon 1st look of the menu, you would know this is not a typical Thai restaurant as it fused with Laotian style of cooking.  It is a very small menu.  The prices might seem a bit high for lunch for such a tiny spot but it is par with the thai restaurants in the area.Food:  We ordered red curry chicken and green curry beef.  Each were $12.50.  Liz brought family style rice in a large bowl and the 2 large bowls of curries.  Now, at first I was a bit verwhelmed, thinking we may have ordered too much for lunch.  However, what would've been a heavier dish is more watery.  She called it a soup.  Both were light dishes filled with vegetables and some meat, not too much meat mostly veggies.  The heat of the dishes are rated 1-5 with 5 being the hottest and I opted for 3 for my green curry.  It was quite hot but not enough to put one off.Service:  the service here is excellent.  I noticed the extra things that makes the service stand out.  The owner upon bringing our meals offered ""if you need more rice let me know and I'll top of up.  You can't have too much rice with this soup.""  I notice her bring a fresh spring roll to a couple beside us on the house because based on their conversation the couple were regulars.  The owner was very proud of their restaurant and their food that she was a walking advertisement.  She checked in us often but not too much.  When we finished she offered not just to pack our leftovers but also gave us more rice for ""lunch"" the next day.The topper here is she asked us what we thought of the restaurant overall from the food to the sign outside.  She's only been open for 5mths.  Already with regulars, plenty of them picked up take out.  The sign I told her was difficult to see.  We got lost looking for it.  The sign blended with the vlank signs for the unleased places next door.This is worth a try and definitely many lunch breaks.",4.0,4.0,36,2017-11-03,43.642792,-79.427495,"Thai , Asian Fusion"
Lao Thai Restaurant,"I have walked by this quaint little restaurant many times but never got a chance to try it. The restaurant itself is very small and has about 6 tables, each seating up to 4 customers. We got a cute little corner booth. I believe the restaurant is family owned so there was only one waiter taking all the orders, bringing out the food and drinks and refilling our water. Although there was only one, he was efficient and very fast.We ordered the Chicken Souk Gai, Beef Pad Thai, and the Chicken Red Curry. Let me just start of by saying that the portions are GENEROUS! Especially for the price range. It is very affordable and you will definitely feel like you ate a feast leaving this restaurant.The Chicken Souk Gai is a laotian style spicy garlic ginger chicken soup. It is absolutely delicious and perfect for the winter because it just warms you right up. Let me just say for those who don't like ginger, don't worry because the flavoring isn't too strong, in fact it was just the right amount. The pad thai was so good, we were about to order a second plate but realized we definitely would've over eaten. The Red curry is standard red curry, so it wasn't the star of the meal.I would definitely go back and try all the other items!!",4.0,5.0,36,2017-11-13,43.642792,-79.427495,"Thai , Asian Fusion"
Lao Thai Restaurant,"The WOW dish here is the Souk Gai, a quite simple soup with a powerful, clear ginger broth. Supremely addictive, and gets better with each spoonful. It had a lot of chicken in it (these were really tender thigh pieces), green onions and tons of ginger shavings. It's served with rice on the side or to add to the soup. We shared this since we both wanted to try it, but I'm eager to come back and slurp this up all by myself, especially on a cold day.We were super hungry and wanted to try more things since it's a brand new place in the neighborhood, so opted for the Gang Keo, which is green curry (we chose chicken) and the Pad Thai (we chose shrimp). The thing that struck us with both dishes was how everything tasted very healthfully prepared, distinctly NOT overly greasy or salty. The curry sauce was coconutty, but wasn't quite as thick and satiating as other green curries I've had. There was a mega-dose of veggies in the curry, huge pieces of broccoli and cauliflower, not overcooked. I would choose a different meat next time, as this had white chicken pieces, which were a bit dry for my taste. (In contrast to the chicken in the Souk Gai).The Pad Thai was very saucy, which I liked a lot, and the shrimp were large and done right (not overcooked or rubbery). A small drawback here was that it wasn't spicy at all. We were asked (warned?) about the spiciness of the Souk Gai when we ordered (we said we liked spicy), but we weren't asked about the spiciness of the other dishes we chose, so we didn't know we should ask for spice in each of them. (Other customers came in to order take-out at the counter while we were there and they were asked how spicy they wanted their Pad Thai.)This seems to be a family-run restaurant and the service was super friendly and welcoming, and laid back. Comfortable chairs, too. We couldn't finish everything so we got it packed up to go and were offered a top-up of rice to take home, which was a kind touch. The leftovers the next day were great!Glad to have Lao Thai in the neighborhood!",4.0,4.0,36,2017-04-30,43.642792,-79.427495,"Thai , Asian Fusion"

Lao Thai Restaurant,"Lao Thai Restaurant was an excellent place to grab lunch on a Saturday. There was more than enough room for guests. Service was super friendly and attentive to anything we needed.To start, we order the papaya salad and nam kao. Papaya salad was amazing. We got the level 2 spicy which was not too bad, could have got the level 3 and had no issues. The nam kao was definitely the favorite at our table. The dish was super fresh with the crunchy texture along with the soft texture of the rice. We needed more lettuce to eat with it which we had no problem getting. You definitely get great portions of food for the prices here. In addition, we ordered the souk gai and gang geo. Both were great and served with rice. We ordered so much that we ended up having enough leftovers for later.Will be back to this place for the great service and delicious food.

The freshness of all three dishes was something that stood out to me. Not only were they packed full of flavour, but they also felt quite healthy as they were chock-full of herbs and vegetables and were light tasting and not at all heavy. The stand out dish was definitely the Souk Gai - definitely something to order when you're feeling under the weather and sooth your soul (and tummy). From the friendly welcome to the amazing cooking, my initial sense is that you can't go wrong here.

We ended up getting the pork belly, pork jowl and beef skirt steak. The side dishes were good. It came with the steamed egg and 2 soups. The kimchi was fermented well and taste was just right. The pork belly, jowl, and the skirt steak were all great cuts and very tender. We got a bottle of makgeolli to drink. There's not much selection, but with a place like this, the smaller the menu the more catered it is for the food.The service here was pretty quick and friendly.

Kookminhakgyo,"Kookminhakgyo is a Korean BBQ restaurant located just north of Yonge/Cummer in a small plaza. The parking lot is not big so depending on the time it may be difficult to acquire a spot. My boyfriend and I decided to get KBBQ on a Saturday night and came around 5:45pm. The place was already packed with people enjoying their selection of meats but we were lucky enough to only wait around 5 min as a table was leaving.The overall seating space in the restaurant is small and there are only around 10-11 tables. The stools can be used as storage as well to put your coats/purses (just open the top of the stool!). The restaurant has no ventilation so you will definitely leave smelling like Korean BBQ. In terms of food, we ordered the pork shoulder, beef skirt meat, and a rice with a soybean paste soup. When you order meat, it comes with a variety of side dishes (kimchi, radish, lettuce, etc.), a steamed egg (which was delicious!), and bean sprout soup. We also got a makgeolli to share. The meat is definitely of higher quality than other KBBQ places I have tried. Overall, portion wise, what we ordered was enough for the both of us. The staff are very friendly and attentive.

These are all things that you will get with your meal Kookminhakgyo!When it comes to the food, you can expect THICK cuts, which, combined with an all-pork menu, give me constant wet dreams. The service was absolutely fantastic, too. The servers came by every time we needed anything (before we even asked) to fill up our side dishes, check in on our water, and generally make sure we weren't burning the place down. That being said: while the food is good and the service great, the big issue here is the ventilation. That mofucker was steaming like a sauna. I am partial to the nearby Daldongnae: they've also got great meat and service, but I don't come out of it smelling like I sprayed on pork deodorant.

Kookminhakgyo,"Kookminhakgyo supposedly means ""national school"" in Korean, and you can tell it's the theme that they were going for once you step inside this small restaurant. The walls are decked out with grade school drawings and you can even find a makeshift classroom desk with an abacus on it. The 80's Korean hipster vibe is how most would describe their decor here. The cuisine is traditional Korean BBQ that is cooked by patrons on a round drum table. The seats themselves are barrels too-you can lift the seat covers to store your belongings in them. A good idea since the place is small and the seating arrangements here are often cramped. The menu options are mostly comprised of different cuts of pork-belly, jowl, shoulder butt, and skirt meat. The only non pork options are beef skirt and beef finger ribs. Definitely not a place for non-pork lovers. The quality of the cuts were good, however. I was especially impressed with the thick cuts of pork belly that cooked great on the grill. The meat here does not come pre-marinated, so you'll have to rely on the two sauces that they provide for extra flavoring. I preferred the red soybean paste sauce over the salty oil one.All orders come with a set of side dishes that include kimchi, picked radish, pickled onions/jalapeños, spicy soup, and steamed egg. They also provide you with unlimited lettuce wraps and diced spring onion to make ssäm wraps with your meat. The servers were very attentive as well and often checked in to make sure we never ran out of lettuce/side dishes. Overall, a very good spot to experience some authentic Korean BBQ. The place seems popular and does not take reservations, so plan accordingly in order to get a table/find parking.

Kookminhakgyo,"This is my 4th time at Kookminhakgyo but my first time writing the review.  My sister recommended this place due to great reviews on Yelp.  This place is in a plaza and it's hard to find since the sign is mainly in Korean.  There's free parking in the plaza but very limited.  If you can't find parking you have to resort to street meter parking.  They don't take reservations here and the wait can range from 15 mins to 1 hour long.  I would recommend when you're 15 mins away call them and leave your phone number to hold a place in line. They really do call you back when your table is ready.  If you have a party of 2 it's easier to get a table fast.  As you can see from the pictures the place is tiny.  The ventilation system is not that great so you'll leave smelling like you were at a Korean bbq place!  They have there cute barrel stools that you sit on but also forms as a jacket and purse storage. You can put all you stuff in the barrel then put the cushion lid back on and voila you have a stool!  They give you amazing appetizers.  You get the shredded green onion salad which you put the spicy sauce on but you can use it for your lettuce wrap.  It also comes with Kim chi, spicy radish and sour jalapeño peppers with onions.  The meal also comes with a pot of steamed whipped eggs and Kim chi soup.  We ordered an extra vegetarian Bi bim boo, stone pot rice.  For our meat we ordered the steak skirt and pork belly.  The meat quality was great and lean.  There was a lot of food for the two of us. So stuffed at the end. The service is amazing.  No matter how busy the servers were they would always get you what you needed really fast when you ask for side dish and lettuce wrap refills.  This place is authentic and amazing.  It my 4th time here but it won't be my last.  I highly recommend this place if you're craving for Korean BBQ. It's not the cheapest place but for the quality and the amount of food you get I say it's well worth it. We didn't drink alcohol and our bill came to $70 for the two of us including tax and tips.",4.0,5.0,121,2017-12-17,43.789107,-79.417852,"Korean , Barbeque"
Kookminhakgyo,"The experience here is 100% must go. It's got a rustic korean street food flare to it and the meat selected for grilling is perfect late night beer, soju, and makgeoli food. Back to the meat, it has to be the best selections of pork by far for alcohol. They do also serve two other types of beef cuts but they mostly serve pork.Me and my friends ordered the Kookminhakygyo Assorted that included Pork belly with and without skin, pork jowl (fucking amazing), pork skirt steak, and pork shoulder butt.IMPORTANT*** You have to cut up your pork belly otherwise the cooking will get no where and fret not, they have scissors for you to do so and you can control how big or small your pieces of pork belly can be. You can cut up the other pieces of meat but I preffered not to.They also get you a STEAMING pot of Egg Souffle (that's what me and my friends called it because we have no idea what it was called - Korean Steamed Egg I believe) and it was SO FLUFFY!!! So mouthwateringly delicious and hot and refreshing! I love the extremely light flavour and broth/extra flavouring they used to steamed it with if they did at all and this is a must! In fact we ordered another one because it was so good.The whole grilling experience comes with thinly sliced green onions and garlic, pickled onions and jalapeños, bean sauce and salt and sesame oil to dip, and lettuce to wrap. The side dishes were radish and cabbage kimchi and the soup was a light kimchi vegetable soup with very small amounts of beansprout in it.We also ordered two Vegetable Bibimbaps for our Vegan/Vegetarian friend. Our first order had radish kimchi in it so they couldn't eat it because they can't tolerate spicy due to health concerns, however the server was very nice and the kitchen staff was very accomodating to remove the radish kimchi and add more of the other vegetables present for my friend in our second order.Last but not least, never expect shit service here because the service is here is AMAZING. The servers are SO WONDERFULLY NICE. They were always smiling and very courteous and even though the place was jam packed at midnight on a Saturday, the service was very fast because these servers know what they're doing. I love being around these servers and they make me feel right at home as if I'm cooking my own food show with help!Definately my go to place for late night grilling of fine pork selections in an authentic and homey restaurant!

Kookminhakgyo,"This is one of the better korean restaurants specializing in Table BBQ. Although the meat is not marinaded the value and quality makes up for it. Unlike other Korean restaurant where they make you order minimum two portions, you only have to order one here! I ordered the pork belly without skin and beef rib finger -something (Kalbi) which came with 3-4 banchans, a hot bowl of steamed egg and a spicy bean sprout soup. accompanying the meat was lettuce green onions and various sauces. Without the green onion or sauce the meat would be very lacking and bland luckily everything went hand and hand. The quality of the actual meat was amazing you could taste how fresh it was! The service was good, our water was never empty and we had bottomless lettuce and green onions as well! Very nice of them considering they give you a lot to begin with. It's a small restaurant and table turnover isn't that quickest considering everyone gets the table BBQ, make sure to go at a off time to effectively get a table! Free parking outside of the restaurant but it's a zoo out there park at own risk. Not much decor that was really worth noting sort of a no frills type of vibe going on, which doesn't matter to me considering I'm there for the food. I would come again but with more people considering they have a group of 4 combo I would like to try soon!",4.0,4.0,121,2017-04-23,43.789107,-79.417852,"Korean , Barbeque"
Kookminhakgyo,"We came to this place on Sunday night at 11 expecting it to be empty but they were really busy.  First impression was old school feel with metal barrels as seats, you can even put your jacket inside the barrel, pretty cool.Their meat items are not marinated, all flavour comes from their spicy sauce which tastes like buffalo sauce.  I still prefer marinated meat for BBQ therefore minus one star for not marinating the meats.  The meats are of high quality and freshness though.  Some people prefer fresh meat barbecued and dipped with sauces instead so it's up to you.When you order BBQ meat items, it comes with a bunch of side dishes like steam egg, lettuce, bean sprout soup and others.The plaza is pretty small with few other shops and I could see issues with parking during busy hours.",4.0,4.0,121,2017-04-12,43.789107,-79.417852,"Korean , Barbeque"

Kookminhakgyo,"Wow...so much hype - I was expecting so much more.  I never went to junior school back in the old country - which I guess is the generic name that this place is named after.The place is like a few other place.  Round drum tables with a gas fired centre for BBQ.  You also sit on drums as seats.  Cute down to earth concept but the table gets really really crowded and accidents will happen.The fam and I decided to give this place a try over our usual BBQ spot - Kobi.  The place was packed and there was a waiting list, however, we said it was ok to take the first table near the entrance.  The first table usually gets waiting people almost on top of you, however, the day was nice and most people opted to wait outside - which made it bearable to sit there.First of all, the place is made for PORK lovers.  We ordered the pork platter that came with all kinds of cuts for four people.  The meal comes with the standard bahnchahs, an egg side, a kimchi guk with sprouts, BBQ fixings, and we ordered an extra soon-tufu as well.I did mention the place was tight.  Since we were sitting on the front table, I used the window sill seating area as an extension of the table.  We were lucky as there was no space whatsoever. The cuts of pork was fresh and cooked well on there bbq.  The bahnchan and fixings were pretty standard fare and nothing outstanding.  The lettuce for the wrap was less than fresh and I don't think they do a good job washing it.  The egg dish was good.  The kimchi guk was nothing to talk about and the soon-tofu jigae was ok at best.We left the place full - as the pork platter was really quite large.  We would have liked to have some kalbi instead of only pork.The parking here is at a premium.  Be ready to wait for a spot or park in a side street and walk.The price is fair for the meal, however, the tight quarters, table space issues, and hard parking makes it a difficult place to go as a family.  This place is as the name goes - it really is for the youngsters - who don't mind wearing pungent odours on the rest of their date.For me, I'm going back to Kobi.Cheers!",4.0,3.0,121,2017-06-25,43.789107,-79.417852,"Korean , Barbeque"

Mr.Tonkatsu,"tldr: A solid Korean-style Tonkatsu shop. Full katsu sets (salad, soup, rice, and katsu) for good prices $15. Ample seating. Punctual service.This shop serves Korean-style katsu dishes. Korean katsu is flakier than traditional Japanese katsu. This shop is similar to Wako Donkasu in LA (for you LA yelpers). The meal sets are the go-to. Sets include cabbage salad, rice, miso soup, and katsu of your choosing. You can add curry on the side among other extras.

Mr.Tonkatsu,"The Chicken Katsu did not taste like any other katsu from other restaurants! The portion was just perfect; not too little and not too much. Before receiving the food, they give you a bowl of sesame seeds which you have to grind up and put in the sauce once your katsu arrives. You are given a bowl of miso soup on the side of your katsu. The Chicken Katsu tasted a bit strange, sorta like the BBQ pork you can get in chinatown. The restaurant had no wifi, which is a bit of a downside to many people. Most of the items on the menu were a bit expensive. Overall, it was a very decent experience, but I would most likely not come back in the future.",4.0,3.0,27,2017-12-29,43.664331,-79.384517,"Japanese , Korean"
Mr.Tonkatsu,"I think the options here are great if you eat meat, but if you have anyone in your party who doesn't, the options for them are limited.The food itself was ok, though somewhat heavy (naturally because it's fried). The portion is large, but it included only a small amount of carb. If the ratio of meat to carb was different, maybe it will feel different. Rice is cheap...just add a little bit more!We sat right next to the kitchen. It was a cold day, so it was nice that it was warm, but I can imagine if it's not cold, we probably would've asked to get moved.Overall, it's nice to see the area getting more restaurants like this.

Mr.Tonkatsu,"Solid!I have had tonkatsu in Japan, so I knew what to expect, as well as the fact I may be let down. The first thing I'll comment on was the service.  This can go very many different ways, and often times as a white chick dining in an Asian restaurant, I feel a bit ignored or under appreciated as a customer. This wasn't the case here, and I even felt comfortable and welcomed enough to ask some direction to ensure we ate the meal the way it was intended to be eaten:- salad dressing sauce on the table goes on the cabbage- ground sesame seeds go in the brown sauce that comes w the KatsuI like how w the meal, we got unlimited Miso soup, rice and cabbage. The Sapporo paired PERFECTLY w the pork - we both preferred the less expensive pork loin to the pork tenderloin.  The soba noodles were not worth the extra $1.50 or whatnot, i wouldn't recommend them (and I'm a soba fiend).

Pork tenderloin was ok and the curry sauce is flavourful. Have to dip the pork with the curry sauce if not it won't taste as good without the sauce. Is too pricy if is a $20 lunch and is not filing.

The curry chicken was great but it wasn't something unique - I've had good katsu curry elsewhere too and while this was still delicious, it wasn't special.  The cheese tonkatsu on the other hand was just absolutely delicious.  The cheese was stringy and delicious and the fried layer was so light, fluffy, and delicious.  You also had a ground sesame (grind yourself) to put into the sauce too, which made it all the more delicious. The meals come with a salad and soup and are a very good portion.  Service is absolutely fantastic - the waitress kept checking in to see if we needed anything more and even gave us more sesame to grind.   Overall, I would definitely come back here for lunch.",4.0,4.0,27,2017-08-02,43.664331,-79.384517,"Japanese , Korean"

Extra cutlet cost $8 but you have to order with the base cutlet set.If you don't feel like spending $13 - $15, a cheaper but also delicious option from this restaurant would be the donburi for $10.

Goods & Provisions,"We went to Goods & Provisions to celebrate an anniversary with delish Spanish food. The cocktails were killer, the bartender made me a couple of virgin darn and stormies with a delicious candied ginger garnish. My husband loved their negroni. We ate a little bit of everything. The sardines were excellent and the patatas bravas were the best I've had outside of Spain. The shishito peppers (pimientos de padrón) were also very nice, though there were more hot ones than I would have anticipated in a typical order and they could have used a bit more salt. The pork belly was excellent, a quail's egg never goes amiss! The octopus was flavourful and perfectly cooked. The brussel sprouts were very nice, smokey and spicy but the smoked trout seemed a bit out of place.

On New Years Eve, we decided to grab a drink here to avoid the chaos in Nathan Philips. The atmosphere was very smoothing. I enjoyed the decor along with the music-music from the 60's and 70's were playing.  We both grabbed a drink each. I wanted a drink that was sour and sweet at the same time but I did not want a boozy drink. The server recommended me to get the Mezcal Sour. I got the Mezcal Sour and my friend got the penicillin. We both enjoyed our drinks. I wished my drink was more balanced, I felt that it was missing a little something. The servers were attentive but not intrusive. I enjoyed myself there. As a plus, they gave us champagne on New Years, which was a nice touch!

The Brussel sprouts were good - spicy and sweet. I'm not exaggerating when I say I have no idea what I was putting on my fork. You can't sell a forty dollar steak in a place where people can't see it.

Goods & Provisions,"A cool-looking place with good atmosphere, but I was, frankly, disappointed with the food. Tuna tostadas start promising in the first bite, but then you realize the flavour burst is all just salt overpowering the tuna. Wild boar empanadas were blah. The best things on the menu were the spicy brussel sprouts - inventive and delicious! The octopus was cooked perfectly (though could have arrived easier to share given this is a tapas joint). And the desserts were good too. Wine list is way overpriced ($50 to $75 as I recall, and given what they are I think this place is really stretching the markups). And the most bizarre thing was no coffee or tea available. Huh? Just weird.

Goods & Provisions,"What a stylish and sumptuous little gastropub. I had a wonderful time at Goods and Provisions. The staff are friendly, welcoming and attentive (nothing that should not be expected). Ambiance is dimmed lighting, eclectic antique decor that is well designed without feeling forced. The cocktail list had the regular tales on the classics, with personalized touches. I really loved the The Old Fascist, which is like an old fashioned with smokey spiciness. I couldn't resist Hand in Glove because of the reference to The Smith's Song--the owner's a big 80's music fan and they played a great mix of tunes I hadn't heard in years (not the overplayed), as well as some older bluesy rock. Finally, the food. My friend and I did not eat a lot. Wish we'd had more, but now there's more reason to return. The tuna on tostada was a ceviche-style tuna dish that was out of this world delicious. Best of the kind I've ever eaten. We also shared pork belly and quail egg on brioche. Scrumptious. Finally we had wild mushrooms on toast--if you're a mushroom fan, don't pass this one by. It's the little touches that make a great restaurant stand out. When our waiter learned it was a first date, she brought us two coupe glasses of cava. Bravo!

Patria,"Definitely a 4 star restaurant! Firstly, this place is absolutely beautiful, the restaurant seems massive, it has high ceilings but still achieves a warm and romantic atmosphere. The ambiance is really great, especially on a cold night, you feel like you've been transported to a cool vacation spot. The food is also really good!We ordered a number of dishes, and I wasn't particularly disappointed in any of them, but some were definitely better than others. The ambiance, like I noted was excellent, but on an absolutely freezing night we were seated very closely to one of the entrances and the breeze kept hitting us every time someone opened the door, which was quite frequent. We had asked to move but they mentioned that they were totally booked up so we were out of luck. I think they should opt to not let people sit there on nights like that since it was quite uncomfortable at times. After we started eating and drinking it was definitely less of an issue however. We ordered just about half the menu it seems but some highlights were: the pan con manchego, the selection of meats, beef tartar, the Croquetas de Setas, the queso frito, the lamb chops, the rib eye, scallop paella, and for dessert, the curros and semifrio. Some items I could probably take or leave were the wagyu meatballs and the patatas bravas. Not bad, but not super memorable. The rib-eye and the croquetas were the highlight for sure and for dessert, the semifrio was amazing, full of flavour and texture! The food is all beautifully presented as well as fresh tasting, with an expert focus on bold flavours and textures. We also ordered some wine and sangria and they were all great! The reason for the 4 stars instead of the 5 is the price point. I really can't understand the justification for the high prices and tiny portions. For a group of 5, you'll probably need to order 2 or more of each menu item for everyone to try one piece. For the most part, the tapas have 2/3 pieces of food per order so it can get expensive when you start order 2-3 of each item. It's definitely not for the faint of wallet but it's an experience to try at least once or on a special occasion. The service was very good. Our drink glasses were filled regularly and the server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the food, which was good as this was a new experience for me. He let us try a few wines before ordering a glass which was also a nice touch. I've never had spanish wine but everyone seemed to enjoy theirs. The sangria was delicious. Overall, I'd probably only come back if someone was footing the bill, I'd be hard pressed to spend what it takes to get full at this place, even though it's exceptionally good.

Patria,"The first to arrive was the Queso Frito, a sharing dish of goat cheese, orange blossom honey, walnut, and figs.  This was a really tasty dish!  The round goat cheese was covered with the orange blossom honey and crispy on its surface.  When K cut through the cheese, there was also some hot goat cheese that oozed out.  It was so good!  The walnuts and figs were a good addition to the dish.  I was really impressed with this cheese dish!I have had good charcuterie in Spain and the Spanish charcuterie here at Patria sure didn't disappoint.  We ordered the platter, Selección De Embutidos, of ibérico lomo, ibérico chorizo, jamón serrrano, and salchichón.  Within the platter itself, I couldn't distinguish which meat was which but all I know is that it was all really good!  I enjoyed a glass of Red Sangria.  It had red wine, port, sweet vermouth, Spanish brandy, spiced poached pear reduction cloves, orange juice, and pear nectar.  It was amazing!  One of those really good red sangrias. K enjoyed a bottle of Sidra Bere, crisp and refreshing apple cider from the Basque Region of Spain.  I wasn't a huge fan of this rougher tasting apple cider.Up next, we received our small plate of paella.  The Paella Patria had gulf shrimp, mussels, calamari, fish, snap peas, clams, and saffron.  Mmm, this was an amazing paella!!  It might be one of the best paella dishes I've ever had.  It was so full of flavour and the seafood were all so fresh and plentiful.  It was so good!We finished off with a meat dish which was the Albondigas, wagyu meatballs with spicy tomato piperade, onion, and manchego.  K really liked the wagyu meatballs!  I thought they were good; the meatballs were very densely packed.We enjoyed really good and friendly service from our server that night.  He checked us on us periodically and was very upbeat.",4.0,5.0,362,2017-10-23,43.645424,-79.396221,"Spanish , Wine Bars , Tapas Bars"

I don't normally like chorizo which was in the brussels, but it was delicious. Our waitress was really nice. We asked to try a wine that was similar to a pinot noir and she brought us two to try, one that was $85 a bottle and one that was $50 a bottle. I really appreciated that because we definitely did not want to spend $85 for a bottle, so it was nice of her to bring a less expensive option.Also, there was no complimentary bread on the menu but we asked for it and she gave it to us anyways!Overall, would definitely come back here.

It's really dark in the restaurant, which makes it pretty romantic. But, it is really loud, so don't expect to be able to have deep conversations with whoever you go with. You'll kind of be yelling across the table. The wine list is pretty extensive, and expensive! But they have great wine. The server will tell you you need like 4 dishes per person, but that's way too much! We were a group of 4 and got 7 dishes, and two small paella which was perfect. We got the seafood paella and another one that I don't remember. For Canadians or Europeans the salt level might be good, but for my American pallet, it was not salty enough. So, as rude as i'm sure it was, I asked for salt. It was funny because I don't think this happens much, since it took them like 15 minutes to bring it. And it was loose salt in a little dish.

Patria,"Just after my trip to Barcelona and experiencing the great Spanish food, I had to see if I could find a place in Toronto that could match a bit of the amazing tastes I had.  I will say that Patria has the atmosphere done right with it's beautiful modern dining room that is rich in textures and monochromatic steel greys.  It just allows a nice canvas to let the food pop out and some of it is quite good.Reservations are not always necessary but its easily done via opentable.  I grabbed an early table and though they do have a shaded patio in one of the larger alley ways, the crazy Toronto heatwave had me begging to stay in AC.  The tables are nicely spaced out with a lounge like area near the bar and a more formal dining seating area closer to the kitchen.  I love the fact the have a 2nd story alcove meant for a larger private party.  We saw a wine tasting dinner going on up there and think its would be a great spot.  I would say that this is a great spot for a date night.  Though the fellow patrons was a mixture of a demure group for a bridal party, several Kardashian-lite groups, and some people walking in California surfer beach attire (lose tank tops, baggy shorts, unkempt wavy hair, and flip flops... this was the girls. Explaining the guys is a novel itself).  I would have expected more of an upscale experience but to each their own to enjoy good Spanish food.The menu was easily explained as tapas by our friendly server.  We noticed there was definitely two teams working the tables really well together. The servers who took orders and mostly did the food delivery but a very smooth and fun set of secondary servers who worked the entire room to deliver food and take care of any small items (water refills, new plates, serving paella, additional mixing of plated dishes...).Jamon croquettes - Patria did a good take on these traditional tapas dish.  It was hot with a nice crispy exterior and the creamy interior being the way to bring the rich flavour of the jamon ham to your tongue.  4/5Wagyu meatballs (Albondigas) - A solid take on meatballs as they were tender and not dry.  The manchego cheese and tomato sauce was needed to give it an added flavour but could have used a bit more. 3.5/5Bacon wrapped dates (Datiles) - This was a really good dish.  I first had this dish in Chicago and it was mind blowing.  Every time I see it on the menu, I order it.  This is a good dish with the sweet and savoury being fairly balanced.  The salty crisped up bacon wrapped up the sweet gooey dates that holds the melted manchego cheese.  Whats not to love.  I would have liked it if it had a bit of spicy chorizo added inside the dates (thats what I had in Chicago).  4/5Empanadas - These are quite pretty and another solid dish coming out of the kitchen.  The tender meat was plentiful inside a nice crust that was baked really well.  4/5Seafood Paella (Paella Patria) - On my trip, I had super terrible and phenomenally amazing paella. Kudos to Patria for not skipping the seafood in the paella.  I would say that this isnt a traditional take or flavour of the Catalonian seafood paella I had.  It is a nice dish though.  It was missing some of the spices and the well known crispy rice crust that gives the paella a wonderful burst of texture and flavour in each bite.  3.5/5Patatas Bravas - Crispy cubes of potato that are drenched in a bright tomato and molten egg yolk sauce.  For a side, this was quite enjoyable.  I got it for a filler but found myself going back to this more than I planned.  4/5I have to admit that I was super worried that we would not have enough to eat and it was pricey from the other reviews.  I can safely say we left satisfied but not overly full which is right in my mind.  It definitely hits a bit higher on the price point but no where ridiculous did you sign off your first born.  I would say the service, tastes, and atmosphere does make it a worthwhile stop for any date night or first tastes (or second!) into good Spanish food.",4.0,4.0,362,2017-09-28,43.645424,-79.396221,"Spanish , Wine Bars , Tapas Bars"
Patria,"Having been to Spain earlier this year, I had a craving for Spanish tapas and Patria did not disappoint. Patria is a chic upscale tapas restaurant located on King Street West in Toronto. Great atmosphere. Attentive service. A tad on the pricey but justified by the quality of the food.While all of the tapas were delicious, there were a few standouts. To start, I would recommend the Pulpo A La Gallegos, featuring Spanish octopus. It was prepared with the octopus sitting on fingerling potatoes. The brussels sprouts with spicy tomatoes, aioli and chorizo was also delicious.I would also recommend the paella - which is a house specialty.  The paella is served in the traditional way, in a wide, two-handled pan, with a thin layer of bomba rice that tastes like super-concentrated seafood and is just perceptibly caramelized and crunchy wherever it touched the pan. The cuttlefish and langoustines on top taste silky and almost creamy. Ensure you leave room for dessert. The fried milk with rose petals ice cream was inspired. We also tried the churros and mousse de avellana - both were excellent as well.",4.0,4.0,362,2017-10-27,43.645424,-79.396221,"Spanish , Wine Bars , Tapas Bars"
Patria,"I think this was my favorite restaurant in Toronto. We loved it. We settled into the bar area, just us initially although the rest of the space was bustling. The high vaulted ceilings give the place a dramatic feel as do the oversized renaissance-esque paintings looming over the bar in the background. It's a cool, dimly lit space. My husband ordered the Barrel aged wise guy - rum based cocktail, pre mixed. It smelled smokey and the run was fragrant but not overly syrupy. He next opted for the manhattan. He was happy. Nothing earth shattering but good. I had a White sangria which was mild and lightly flavorful. It had diced apples and a few small pieces of strawberry. Not super sweet as many American versions are. I wasn't in love with it so I ordered a red sangria instead for my next beverage. Overall in Toronto, I found the wine seriously lacking which is why I ditched my standard pour to try the sangria. Again with the red it was very mild, not incredibly sweet and the taste of the wine was minimal. It was just OK. Better than the white but not stellar. I think I was missing more of the fruit flavors typically accompanying sangria. After the sangria the bartender offered me a sampling of a Tempranillo for $15 Canadian that'd caught my eye. Par for the course it was young & almost tart. I passed but this was a common experience with every wine I ordered in Toronto so I don't hold it against them. The interior is Beautiful and set back from the main strip. A kind, attentive female bartender who seemed interested in her cocktail crafting took care of us and the entire restaurant. She was a busy woman but handled it well. I loved their menu & wish we'd eaten here instead. The menu was heavy with Spanish tapas listings to include many dishes featuring manchego cheese. We ordered the bacon wrapped dates and they were exquisite. Everything you'd imagine from the name. The sweet, warm texture of the date complimented by the crisp bacon and warm, creamy manchego. The salty, pork flavor from the bacon paired perfectly with the sweet flesh of the date. To top it off it was drizzled in authentic maple syrup. Part appetizer, part dessert. All parts phenomenal. I seriously enjoyed them so much I thought about ordering a second helping. I didn't & instead ordered the almonds which were a small portion given the price and were underwhelming. I'd skip those and probably get the olives next time.",4.0,4.0,362,2017-08-28,43.645424,-79.396221,"Spanish , Wine Bars , Tapas Bars"
Patria,"I've been here a few times over the past couple of years for dinner and brunch. Having tried many items on both menus, here are my top recommendations:Datiles ($10) - if you like sweet and savoury things, this is perfect for you. The sweetness of the dates offsets the savoury bacon and manchego, and the spicy kick from the pepper is nice. It come with 5 dates. I order this every single time. Paella Patria (small $30/large $55) - make sure you put in your paella order right when you're seated as it takes 45min to make. While their paella is good and contains a good ratio of seafood to rice, I do find them kind of small, especially for the price. I've typically shared a large paella between 4-5 people, and a small between 3 people, and ordered a few more dishes to share.Huevo de pato y pisto ($13) - This is easily the most reasonably priced dish at this place and worth the price, but only available at brunch. It's essentially a scramble of peppers, cheese, and chorizo, topped with an over easy duck egg, served with a side of bread. Their bread is cut thick and is so fresh and soft. The yolk mixes very well with the flavourful scramble, and compliments the bread. Red sangria ($35 for a jug) - I usually don't like red sangria as much as white sangria, but I really enjoyed this one. Very refreshing and not too sweet.Many of the smaller dishes, such as the bread, croquettes and empanadas, come with 2 pieces only, but they can add a third for a proportional cost if you're sharing between 3 people. They kindly waived the minimum spend and set menus for me when I had my birthday dinner there with 12 people. I've had mixed experience with service there. Service was surprisingly slow at brunch, even though there were about 4 tables seated only. This was after the waitress condescendingly told me it was unnecessary to order the paella first as the 45min wait at dinner is because it's much busier then. Still ended up waiting that long for the paella to arrive anyway so I wasn't pleased... Overall their food quality is consistently good but I find it to be a tad expensive for the portion sizes. I like the ambiance of the restaurant so I would still recommend this place for a nicer group dinner or date night.",4.0,4.0,362,2017-09-24,43.645424,-79.396221,"Spanish , Wine Bars , Tapas Bars"

I made reservations for two for a Saturday evening to celebrate Valentines Day.We were quickly seated and had our coats hung up the staff. We looked through the menu and decided to go with razor clams ($20.00 plus tax) which was a special of the day, pulpo which is essentially a grilled octopus on a bed of roasted potatoes which was also a special of the day ($17.00 plus tax), jamon croquetas ($10.00 plus tax) and the Patria paella which is essentially a seafood paella ($55.00 plus tax for two). I had a pint of Estrella Damm which is a Spanish beer ($9.00 plus tax), since it's a Spanish restaurant, they only offered Spanish beers.The pulpo ($17.00 plus tax) which was a special of the day was essentially grilled octopus on a bed of roasted potatoes was okay, perfectly cooked, beautiful presentation but a little under seasoned.The jamon croquetas ($10.00 plus tax) which was croquettes with serrano ham inside lightly drizzled with an aioli sauce. This appetizer was fantastic, perfectly breaded, nice inside and fantastic aioli sauce.The razor clams ($20.00 plus tax) which was also a special of the day was done really well, perfectly cooked and covered in a cilantro based sauce. It was beautifully presented and the sauce worked really well because it masked the usual fishy smell of razor clams.The Patria paella ($55.00 plus tax for two) which is essentially a seafood paella was amazing, probably the best you will get in Toronto. It consisted of shrimp, mussels, calamari, fish, snap peas, clams and saffron. The rice was cooked perfectly and flavourful, all the seafood items were also cooked perfectly, an amazing dish overall.The service was fantastic, your water was always quickly refilled, your dinner napkin was always quickly folded when you left the table, and the server were really helpful guiding you through the menu and letting you know how much food would suffice and not being overbearing.Overall, Patria is a fantastic Spanish tapas eatery situated in a hip area of Toronto, definitely priced at a higher price point and the portions aren't large and you will probably need to order quite a bit to get full but keep in mind it's tapas. The service and food is fantastic and perfect for first dates, couples night out or dinner with friends before a night out on King St West.",4.0,4.0,362,2017-02-16,43.645424,-79.396221,"Spanish , Wine Bars , Tapas Bars"
Patria,"Patria is a solid upscale Spanish restaurant. The decor is very elegant and stylish. Service was very good. We came here to celebrate my friend's birthday. The server was very helpful to recommend their signature dishes. We have ordered Paella Patria - very flavourful yet not salty which was the common problem other Paella I have had. The Paella with lots of fresh seafood - shrimps, mussels, clams, fish, scallops. It was well executed. Seleccion de Embutidos - selection of different Spanish charcuterie. They were displayed from he light to strong flavours. That was the best way to sample their charcuterie for the first time. Gambas Al Ajillo (from daily special) - wild gulf shrimps with garlic, parsley and chili. The shrimps were very fresh and the herbs didn't overpower the shrimp taste. It was delicious. Mousse de Avellana - Hazelnut mousse, salted caramel, dulce leche cream, caraquillo, candy roses. The presentation was beautiful and the dessert was very light and delicious. Highly recommend to get it. For the price point, it may not be my everyday go-to restaurant, but I will definitely go back for great special occasion.",4.0,5.0,362,2017-07-11,43.645424,-79.396221,"Spanish , Wine Bars , Tapas Bars"
Patria,"I was choosing restaurant for a special occasion-my birthday and Patria was an actual win-good value, great food and amazing interior (per pictures and review read). It was my first time here, I've reserved a table for 2 via opentable, it was an option for special occasion and requested seating (couch set, near those majestic portraits). When I've showed up at Patria for my reservation, it was pretty empty, but the hostess showed me our tiny table near the kitchen and when I mentioned it's my birthday and I would like a nice table,she replied that she has full reservation for today's evening and I can not be seated where I wanted. Anyway, I've got what I wanted but had this taste of ""unprofessionalism""-not sure if I'll come back, but the food was good (tapas plates), our waiter was nice and did a brief explanation for the menu selection",4.0,4.0,362,2017-12-05,43.645424,-79.396221,"Spanish , Wine Bars , Tapas Bars"
Insomnia Restaurant & Lounge,"The food and atmosphere overall is great. It did seem more intimate / more suitable for one on one dining and drinks, I did not see many groups of friends at a table. My first experience with Insomnia was through food delivery. I wanted to come in and experience the full package so my boyfriend and I had reservations for a Saturday night. We were greeted and seated immediately, right by the windows facing Bloor st. The restaurant was dim and romantic, but the street lights coming in added a nice touch to the ambience.Our server, Raza (not sure how to spell her name, sorry!!), was very friendly and informative. We ordered everything she recommended and we loved every dish. She also mentioned how their Old Fashioned is more traditional, and how they have a regular who comes in exclusively for the old fashioneds. I've had my fair share of Old Fashioneds and this is one of my favourites (they use 1 big square cube of ice rather than regular ice cubes!).To start we ordered the mussels, and Raza recommended we get their complimentary bread to dip. The bread isnt listed on the menu with the dish as the mussels are noted gluten free, but it is a very highly recommended option! The mussels were soo good, and didn't have any grimey seafood scents or flavour. The sauce the mussels were soaked in was creamy, but not overly rich. We also tried the calamari, and it was good, but the mussels were my favourite out of the two.For our entree, my boyfriend was debating between chicken and waffles or their spicy penne. Our server mentioned the owner of Insomnia is also the co-owner of Dirty Bird, so the chicken and waffles are the same recipe. He immediately chose the chicken and waffles. I heard Insomnia is known for their signature Insomnia burgers, but I was in the mood for pasta. Raza said the rose sauce shrimp linguine was her favourite, so I went with that. I highly recommend the shrimp linguine with rose sauce, especially if you're hungry. The portion was huge, and I really wanted to keep eating it but I couldn't finish. I got a second drink after my old fashioned, called Smoking Gun. It wasnt too sweet, nor tasted overwhelmingly of bourbon. It was a luxurious orange chocolate cocktail with an even better aftertaste, and I love how they fill the beverage up to its rims!I would say Insomnia is the perfect date night spot, or a great place to enjoy a cocktail or two (they also have a long list of intricate cocktails + the usual beer and wine) catching up with your friends.",4.0,5.0,704,2018-01-27,43.665131,-79.410852,"Lounges , Breakfast & Brunch , Comfort Food"
Insomnia Restaurant & Lounge,"I'll say first that we very much enjoyed the food. We started with the mussels, chips and dip, calamari and chicken wings. The mussels were in a beautiful sauce. The struggle salad is also great! However my Caesar was ridiculously watery, why do they put so much ice in a tomato based drink?! (a problem that is not exclusive to Insomnia)For my part, I got the winterlicious menu and chose: pulled pork taco, chicken and waffles then carrot cake. The taco wasn't too sweet but nothing special either. The chicken and waffles had great presentation and delicious flavour in the chicken however the waffle was soggy and the coleslaw flavorless. The carrot cake was very nice.Also the wait staff was accommodating when one of our members sent back a main because they didn't realise it had a sweet sauce; they re-made it with sauce on the side.My issue is with the seating and bathrooms: they have some regular tables at the front but at the back for larger parties they have low chouchy chairs which aren't comfortable and our group ranged from 29 to 67 and we're all tall so no leg room. Next time I will make sure to ask for a regular table. The bathrooms are the typical rundown downtown basement washrooms but for a place that's trying to be somewhat classy, a fresh coat of paint and new locks on the doors would go a long way (and to empty the garbage), the solutions are too cheap to be ignored.",4.0,3.0,704,2018-01-28,43.665131,-79.410852,"Lounges , Breakfast & Brunch , Comfort Food"

Insomnia Restaurant & Lounge,"Went there for brunch at 9:45am. Make sure you have reservations. We had reservations made through Yelp and that made a difference. There was lots of people lining up. The service was also very good. Our friend had the french toast, a little too much cream cheese to her taste. I had the Huevo Rancheros, it was amazing. Our daughter had mini french toast, she did not really like it and ate our delicious home fries and had extra orders of turkey bacon. Even though there was a long lineup, we were never pressured to hurry or leave. We did not complain about the french toast but the took it out of the bill which was a nice touch.

Insomnia Restaurant & Lounge,"This was a really pretty restaurant near Danforth Subway St. They had Christmas decorations on (not too much) and it looks fantastic. Customer Service was amazing. Our server's name was Rasa. She recommended the vegetarian meals. I also happened to get a $10 discount (only for a total of over $50) from YELP. The manager approved this even though our total was $40. He saw me struggling with my big winter jacket and my packed gym bag and offered to put it away. FoodApp: Curried Crab Cakes - This was so delicious. Not sure what sauce they used but wow. Absolutely loved those cakes.Main Course: Although I was told the fish tacos were popular (vegetarian choice), I opted for the Wild Mushroom Penne. Wasn't crazy about this. Felt it was dry and didn't really entice me with the flavor. Hence the one star off.Dessert: They gave me a free dessert for my birthday.

Insomnia Restaurant & Lounge,"This was the first restaurant I tried in Toronto and it set a high bar for the quality of food in Toronto. I highly recommend the chicken waffles. I loved their rendition: from the display to the taste. The chicken was thick and tender, sandwiched between light fluffy waffles and covered in this unique sweet and sour syrup. We also ordered the Manami eggs benedict which had your choice of bacon or peameal (I was unfamiliar with this bc I'm from the States. It's similar to baked ham) on a curried rice patty instead of the traditional English muffin. Together it made for a salty, crunchy, and delicious dish. Other notes: Service was very slow. We waited a long time to get our waters and give them our orders. Fortunately, the atmosphere made for a comfortable and casual time (so no rush!) The interior was decorated for Halloween, and they have couches and comfy seats in the back.

Insomnia Restaurant & Lounge,"This Bloor West restaurant seems like it have lots to offer. From a stunning everchanging decor and intriguing menu that draw you in. We had to order three plates just to sastify our curiosity. The Oven-Baked Pancake, The Heaven on Earth French Toast and a mini brunch with their self-proclamed legendary sauce and potatos.So. well. Okay. Wow. First.A Pancake is literally a Cake-like batter cook in a Pan. If you oven-baked a ''pancake'' its a cake. So be ready to receive a full size of Overcooked and flavorless cake served to you, with a side of sirup that is so existential if you dont want to eat a dry piece of cake.The Heaven on Earth French toast wear its name quite terribly, with a thick ''french toast'' serving as bread for a sandwich of cold cream cheese and berries. With so much bread, its impossible to taste any of the filling and even if you could, the block of plain cream cheese does not balance well with the berries and blend bread. Its quite unambitious.The legendary sauce is a peppery, vinaigry ketchup,overall not bad. Kinda flirting with the flavours of a BBQ sauce, it was intriguing at least for me to try to find which spices they were using. The Rest, potatoes and eggs were merely average. Which is not saying much for such simple sides. Imsomnia might not be the worst brunch i had in Toronto, but the Gap between expectation, the chef's ideas and execution is so large, its score is largely affected by it.

Insomnia Restaurant & Lounge,"4.5 stars ... it's very good! One of the best brunches in Toronto This place is often found on many Toronto best brunch list and after going, I can see why!  Insomnia has earned its spot on the list in all ways... great atmosphere, friendly and FAST service, wonderful food, and not too hefty on the wallet.  Is it my number one spot? It a close call between here and Le Baratin.  Either way, you cannot go wrong with either spot.This place is incredibly popular ... there were many people waiting for a table throughout the time we ate here... we're talking at least 12+ always standing outside.  They have limited reservations before 10 am online but after that, it feels like a bit of a free for all.  Either come early or be lucky to grab an online rez.  When we arrived @ 10 am, we were warmly greeted and sat within minutes of arriving.We had a great day so the windows and doors were open and allowed the warm breeze to filter through the place.  It's such a cute spot with a lot of open space, exposed brick and nice touches like the branches above your head.  Considering how many tables they turn over, I was surprised on how spotless everything was.  Our table was beside the window and we had a lot of room ... perfect for shots!  The menu is big and a lot of it sounds sooo good.  We ended up getting the famous Heaven on Earth French Toast and a gluten free Manami Benedict with a side of their equally famous home fries.Heaven on Earth French Toast - This is a generous (it can feed 2 people ... or one hungry big guy) portion of really well made french toast.  Nothing is more sad than a dry or soggy french toast.  At Insomnia, the custard fills every nook and cranny and it's crisped up so nicely so you have that great texture of crunchy and smooth custard in one bite.  It also have a good inch (yes a full inch!!) of berries and cream cheese filling!  This is one glorious indulgence and it comes with real maple syrup too!  Is it the best French Toast I've had... mmm no, Le Baratin takes it just cause Baratin French Toast stands on its own without any syrup or add ons.  Insomnia french toast by itself was well cooked but it was mostly flavourless as it relies on the berries and maple syrup. Maybe just adding a touch of vanilla or cinnamon would elevate it.Manami Benedict - Perfectly poached eggs with oozing yolks over curried rice patties is such an interesting idea that I had to have it.  It was very good but I have to admit that the fries possibly stole the show.  Medium sized chunks of super crispy potatoes then covered in a tangy tomato based sauce ... oh its good!  It also came with a side salad and that was a nice little bite to feel like you're eating kinda healthy.Overall, service was fast, pleasant, and kept our coffee filled to the brim.  Loved this spot for brunch and would definitely come back for the fries.  I would like to come back for dinner.  Definitely a great spot for brunch!",4.0,4.0,704,2017-05-30,43.665131,-79.410852,"Lounges , Breakfast & Brunch , Comfort Food"
Insomnia Restaurant & Lounge,"They don't take reservations for brunch after 10AM, so my party of 6 waited about 45 minutes to get a table. Nice part is, you can elect to get a text message from Insomnia when there's only about 10 minutes left of wait, so you can step away to window shop nearby, etc while waiting.Once again, solid food at great portion sizes. Note: they don't do Summerlicious lunch on weekends! My friends ordered different versions of the egg benedict - salmon (Charlotte) $16 and bacon (St. Alban's Classic) $15, which comes with homefries and mixed greens. They said the hollandaise sauce was very, very good, but the poached egg itself unfortunately retained the vinegar taste and as a result the texture is unpleasant. While I am a huge fan of the homefries here, my friends thought it was only ok and didn't like having so much sauce on the fries already (sauce on the side next time, plz).I tried to order the vegan quinoa wrap, which looks huge and phenomenal, but was told that it is not on the brunch menu :'( It was one of my friend's birthday, so we received a small slice of carrot cake on the house.

Alo Restaurant,"Alo is reputed to be one of the top restaurants in Toronto (even all of Canada) and it's super difficult to get a reservation for their tasting menu. It requires camping in front of a computer each month. Luckily they have a bar area that is walk in only, and serves select dishes from their regular menu. The bar area is quite cute as well! Another option is Aloette downstairs, which is more like a relaxed bistro/diner vibe. I went to Alo's bar area to try out their food and drinks. Their cocktail menu is quite detailed and expansive, so we just asked the bartender for some recommendations.The service is excellent! The servers are very friendly and knowledgeable. Their recommendations are super honest, and made sure to keep us reminded of the kitchen close time so we could place our orders on time. We tried scallop and tamachi(yellow fin) as appetizers. Both are very light and refreshing. These are definitely the highlights of the meal! For main, we had the salmon and fried cauliflower. The salmon was just the right amount of raw for us to taste the fat. Dessert was cheesecake, and Chateau de Bourgogne (sweet cheese) and grilled sourdough bread. Both are quite interesting!

Alo Restaurant,"I highly anticipate going to Alo since it is the number one ranking restaurant im Toronto and a friend made a reservation 2 months ahead of time.  I really want to know what the fuss is all about.  Upon entering, we were greeted by a friendly staff who direct us toward the elevator.  The restaurant is on the third flour.  The decor is really just like a high end bar similar to the setup in a hotel.  The open kitchen was quite interesting as you can see how each of the staff works to prepare you dishes.  It was a tasting menu consisting of nine dishes.  The staffs were really professional, but there were smiling much.  I guess that's the tone they want to set at the restaurant.  I did find the music volume to be too loud for my liking as I need to talk louder in order for my friend to hear me.  The appetizer with cube foie gras was interesting, and the choux pastry with savoury filling was quite good.  The presentations were awesome for all dishes.  They were all carefully plated; however, I did find a lot dishes lack just a touch of salt.  The highlights for me  was the soft melt -in-your-mouth ribeye steak.  It was just done to perfection with proper seasoning.  And the coconut dessert, caramelized white chocolate and yogurt was light yet memorable.  I actually did not like the style of serving as I felt a the servers were not warm and friendly; however, they were all extremely professional.  The hidden washroom was kind of weird as the sliding door outside needs some lubricant as it did not slide easily.  For $150 plus 15% tips, I expected more tasty food, but it was an experience to remember.",4.0,4.0,168,2017-11-30,43.648539,-79.395937,"Bars , French"
Alo Restaurant,"My review is based on the dining experience at The Bar at Alo. Ambience -Although the restaurant locates on the top floor of the old building. The interior is very modern and chic. The fine dining area is totally separate so the customers at the bar won't interrupt the diners. The music in the background was not too loud and still allowed us to converse comfortably. There are seats around the bar table and individual tables for bigger group (2-4 people).Things for improvement - The seating is comfortable yet I don't feel the tables are too durable because it was easily moved. I was quite cautious and try not to knock it over. :(Service - We arrived at Alo after 10 PM for some drinks and snacks; we were greeted by a friendly staff and directed us to bar section. Overall, the service was very friendly and attentive. The waiter was very nice and recommended us a few appetizers and drinks based on our preferences. She even advised to order less dishes than we planned to (we were excited to try as many dishes as possible! :D). We are very thankful for her advice because food portion was just right after the dessert. Drinks - They offer wide selection of cocktails and wines. We opted for non-alcohol drinks which are limited to 3 choices. We got the Black tea lemon, passion fruit orange. Both were refreshing and we enjoyed them. Food -Food menu is simple and mainly seafood, a few meat choices (Pork, beef) and very few with veggies. We ordered two seafood dishes and dessert. Overall, it's no doubt they use fresh and premium ingredients. The culinary skills was top notch. The savoury dishes were delicious but didn't blow out my mind.Yet the dessert was so good although the presentation was not as appealing as the other dishes.

Alo Restaurant,"Finding the words to write this review has been so hard--Everything I want to say sounds incredibly cheesy and #cringe but this restaurant is a real  gem and deserves allllll the superlatives. Alo, you are the best of Toronto! Now on to the food: I concur with many other reviewers that the seasoning here is more on the aggressive side. There were a few dishes that I thought were too heavily seasoned--while it was not quite salty enough to be off-putting, it was definitely noticeable. That being said, everything else was near perfect. The veal was outrageously tasty, the scallops were mind-numbingly delicious, and that toro tartare? Amazing! I love that they change up their menus and I'm definitely planning on coming back the next time I am able to get a reservation. (This is a mission in and of itself, mind you.) After tax and tip, the bill came to $160 for dinner and a drink for one. In speaking with my friends who came with me, I think it's important to note that Alo isn't for everyone. While the food here is superb, I do think that the cost also speaks for itself. Some of us thought it was worth the price (me!!!) but others thought it wasn't. Speaking as an economist, I do think you'd have to be relatively price insensitive to enjoy dinner here. In other words, if you're a huge foodie who spends 100% of your pay check on food anyways (me!!!), why not give up a month (or two) of Starbucks runs and eat at the best restaurant in Canada? TLDR: COME HERE ASAP!",4.0,5.0,168,2017-09-04,43.648539,-79.395937,"Bars , French"
Alo Restaurant,"Alo tasting menu - $115 as of November 2017.I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Alo. Upon stepping out of the elevator onto the 3rd floor, I immediately felt like I had stepped into another world. Part uneasy, part excited. There is the bar on one side, a very dark space, followed by the kitchen and the dining area - small and intimate. Service was excellent. The room was quite cold near the end. Be prepared for a 3 hour meal - the dishes come out fairly slowly.Food-wise, there were some hits and misses, depending on personal preference. My favorites were: - Canapes - foie gras cubes (one with some puffed rice, one with caramel) and gougères - a pastry cheese ball- Amuse Bouche - venison tartare - Oyster on potato puree - I loved the creamy potato puree but the oyster was fishy- Homemade pasta with fontina cheese, chestnut, squash - Hokkaido scallop - can see the technique from the thinly sliced green tomatoes and grapes on topNot a fan of the mains:- Pork belly - wasn't particularly soft, didn't like the pairing with coriander sauce- Rib eye - parts were overcooked and not a fan of the sweet sauceThere was a pre-dessert (lemon and cucumber puree sorbet - very refreshing), and 2 desserts - an apple based and a white chocolate based. Both were similar in that they included some sort of icecream/cream, meringue/chocolate and had a modern presentation.

Alo Restaurant,"I have to thank chef Patrick Kriss and front of the house Amanda Bradley for bringing World Class fine dining experience to Toronto!As someone that ""travel to eat"", I had been planning most of my oversea trips around Michelin starred restaurants: Osaka, Hong Kong, Macau, Chicago, New York... Toronto as one of the major cities in Canada had also been lagging behind Montreal and Vancouver for Higher End, Michelin's worthy dining establishment.Until Alo opens its doors back in July 2015.Planning - ReservationReservation can a challenge but worth your effort. Plan accordingly as Opentable reservation is available 90 days out. I was planning to visit Alo as a solo diner but one of my friends was kind enough to join me so I can have the opportunity to try out every offerings on Alo's Tasting Menu.Tasting MenuEverything is seasonal. I recommend visiting in different seasons to appreciate what Alo's team offers. For 2 people, I would suggest ordering one each ""appetizers"", ""main"" and ""dessert"".Presentation was top notch! Pleasing for the eyes and so colourful too! Every dish was a piece of art.  And of course, we all let our cameras eat first and took some photos!We ordered some tea to go with our desserts. 9 different kinds of Solane Tea is served here! You can even smell them before ordering!OVERALL IMPRESSIONA combination of interesting taste profile and texture. The whole meal did take almost 3 hours so hopefully you like your dinner mate. Service here is top notch. The hospitality team (front of the house) is just amazing! Attentive and polite: a 5 star dinner service!Will I be back?! Yes, in a heartbeat!My meal at Alo Restaurant is one of the most memorable meals I had in Toronto.PRO TIPIf you want to have a taste of Alo Restaurant without making a reservation, the best is drop by their bar area for a drink and a snack.

Alo Restaurant,"My husband Matt B. and I started dating on 10/14/09, and we happened to be in Toronto for the first time on 10/14/17. It was a quick trip, so we decided to make the most of our one night in town, pinning an epic meal at Alo to the semi-special occasion of our eighth dating anniversary.This took a bit of planning, namely a calendar reminder to get on OpenTable at 10AM PST on the first Tuesday of September, when reservations opened up for the whole month of October. I was ready and waiting when the clock turned, and this still felt like a crap shoot. I snagged a 9:45 reservation and felt lucky to have it.We showed up a few minutes late, but fortunately, this wasn't a problem. We checked in downstairs and were led into an elevator, which we shared, incidentally, with chef and co-owner Patrick Kriss. The restaurant was on the third floor, and it felt kind of nice and tucked away from the rainy city outside. We were greeted immediately, our jackets and umbrellas whisked away. We waited for a couple minutes in the bar area before being led into the lovely main dining room. It was a great space, comfortable and sleek, with an open kitchen and a relaxed but upscale ambiance.Service was flawless all the way through. Both our waiter and our sommelier were friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive, and the sizable staff made sure every possible need was anticipated and met. I must've mentioned this was an anniversary date, because we were welcomed with complimentary glasses of sparkling rose.Alo is tasting menu only, at least in the dining room, so we had few decisions to make. One of these was whether we wanted a wine pairing with our meal. We went for it, and it definitely enhanced the experience. The wines were all great and the pairings considered and well presented. Also, wine pairings are super fancy and fun.The food was exquisite. We started with a quartet of beautiful little bites: warm gougeres with aged cheddar and apple purée; foie gras with candied maple and bourbon; foie gras rolled in tiny rice crispies. Then a trio of larger amuse bouches, served with a splash of brut. Toro tartare with toasted nori emulsion and yuzu kosho, served on a shiso leaf to form a bite-sized green taco; a brothy, umami-rich dish of baby white shrimp with jellied dashi, kombu, and fermented bamboo shoot; salty, silky Ibérico lomo draped over fragrant musk melon and field tomatoes.The next few courses brought seafood and pasta, leading us into the meat of the meal. Delicate Hokkaido sea scallop sashimi came with green tomato and Himrod grape, dressed with brown butter, lemon verbena oil, and edible flowers. Light but decadently flavored, served with Chenin Blanc from Vouvray. We had a Greco Di Tufo, an Italian white wine, with our grilled Lamèque oyster with pomme purée, smoked butter, and nasturtium. This was a nice dish with some good contrasting textures, the oyster and a sprinkle of bread crumbs layered with the rich, creamy potato. The pasta was superb--substantial, pliant packets of ricotta agnolotti in a buttery, cheesy parmesan chanterelle sauce, served with chanterelle mushrooms, Piedmont hazelnuts, pickled endive, and a robust Piedmont white wine.Then, the fish and meat. Alo was exceptional through and through, but the Ora King salmon was the high point of our meal. This was the best piece of cooked fish I've ever had. It was cured with shio koji and finished in the oven, and it was phenomenally buttery and flavorful, just unreal. Served with Japanese sweet potato purée, maitake mushroom confit, honshimeji mushrooms, and wakame, along with a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. The 60-day dry-aged ribeye was also superb, a tender-to-melting piece of beef with sunchoke, spinach brown butter purée, braised pearl onion, and sauce Choron, a tomato-spiked version of Béarnaise. This came with our first red of the night, a hearty Rhône blend, as well as some pain au lait--soft, fresh milk bread with fleur de sel and house cultured butter.We said yes please to the optional cheese course, a gorgeous round of creamy, lightly tangy Délice du Bourgogne layered with cured plum, pistachio, and tarragon, served with toasted baguettes and a Tuscan Cabernet Franc. A crisp palate cleanser of cucumber lemon purée and sorbet with juniper, kaffir lime, and champagne took us into dessert. There was apple purée with yeast caramel crumble, caramelized sheep's whey ice cream, and Granny Smith apple, a nice, lightly fruity dessert paired with a French dessert wine. Then, to end this incredible meal, a delicious assembly of macadamia purée, caramelized white chocolate crumble, coconut ice cream, macadamia espuma, and finger lime, with a sweet, strong apertif wine.Alo is #1 on Canada's 100 Best Restaurants list for 2017. I've eaten at maybe ten restaurants in Canada, but I believe this wholeheartedly. This was a marvelous, extraordinary dinner. If you're visiting Toronto (or feeling fancy in your own city), plan ahead and book your table.",4.0,5.0,168,2017-11-02,43.648539,-79.395937,"Bars , French"

Alo Restaurant,"Alo was a flawless dining experience. No wonder this restaurant is ranked as the best in Toronto and one of the top in Canada and the world!  Upon being greeted by name, I felt welcome as a guest. I was truly impressed by the professionalism but yet non-pretentious atmosphere. The attention to details is unparalleled. The staff moved around as if they were in a choreographed dance. Choice of napkin, dark or white? Choice of complimentary water, sparkling or still? Each member of the staff had a role and there was never any overlap. Perfection. For drinks... We didn't opt for the wine pairings. (You should!) I ordered the berries and crushed ice (how does something so simple taste so good?) and my husband ordered an old fashioned (amazing).Moving on to the food... 4 bites for the amuse bouche. Each had a balance of taste and texture. Were they petite? Yes. But those small morsels just left me wanting more! At this point, I knew the actual dishes would be impeccable. If I were to describe every single dish, this review would never end.  They were all hits, there were no misses. That aged beef ribeye tartare was out of this world. Agnolotti were pockets of flavour explosions. Everything was presented beautifully, cooked perfectly, and seasoned well. We were definitely full by the end of the tasting menu. My only regret is that I didn't come to this restaurant sooner!  It was well worth the two month wait!  I will most definitely book again for the fall to try a different menu. Alo deserves 5 stars and nothing less. I loved it!",4.0,5.0,168,2017-06-18,43.648539,-79.395937,"Bars , French"
Alo Restaurant,"Review based on visit from July 28, 2017 at 5:30pmHaving trouble making an RSVP on Opentable because it is such a stupid gimmick? Let me tell you how to book: If today's date is July 29, then you can only receive slots up until September 27 (only allowed to book 60 days in advance). Stake out the site; as soon as 12am strikes, refresh your browser and you shall see new time slots. Make sure you decide on a time first i.e. 6pm & have your credit card ready--they go like hotcakes. Think of it as bidding. Service: Exemplary!  Choice of complimentary distilled or sparkling water offered and even a choice in the colour of your napkin; white or light blue. Server was always there ready and waiting to fill our glasses; never had to ask for anything. They even made an effort to pull out your chair to sit down; so charming.The tasting menu we opted for costed $105 per person (no wine pairing which would had been an additional $75)--I was happy they were able to accommodate my pescatarian diet and emailed me to ensure they've covered all my dietary restrictions.Each plate of food was presented in a beautiful and exquisite way.====Menu====[Very good] Hamachi Canapé: Bite-sized which clean and natural flavours[Ok] Sturgeon Caviar Puff: It was tasty, but the puff was an empty shell of air. [Good] Foie Gras Champagne Jelly: Light champagne flavours and nutty foie gras flavour combined. [Meh] Brown butter radish: Bland and less impressive than other items. That being said, it still doesn't take away from the experience.[REALLY GOOD] Truffle Gougère: At least we think it was truffle...not sure since it wasn't on our menu list. But wowzers!! It was so tasty. At first bite, the filling was warm and just oozes into your mouth. Loved it![Ok] Toro, Coconut Chili: The cool coconut was refreshing with the toro. Taste was a bit bland, but the natural flavours were really noticeable. [Good] Baby White Shrimp, Sturgeon Caviar, Cherry Tomatoes: Came out in a dainty bowl with an exquisite spoon made of shell. Again, all natural flavours from each seafood melded with the tomatoes. Tasty indeed.[SOOO GOOD] Hokkaido Sea Urchin, Corn, Yellow Plum: This was soooo good! The chilled corn purée on top complemented the sea urchin so well. [LIKE FALLING IN LOVE] Medai, Sudachi, Myoga, Ice Plants: No salt on the Medai fish aka Bluenose Sea Bass so you can savour it in its freshest form along with citric notes of sudachi  on your tastebuds. Didn't find that the ice plants nor the black crunchy herbs had any flavour, but it gave the dish some nice texture[Too salty] Pain au lait topped with a bit of seasalt and house-made churned butter: Bun was too buttery and even saltier eaten with the chanterelles potato.[Good] Agnolotti, Beaufort Cheese, Australian Black Truffle & Brown Butter Sauce: Delicious with cheese oozing out at each bite from the agnolotti. Not sure why, but really couldn't taste the truffle even though it was on top. The addition of croutons gave it some nice texture.[THE BEST!] King Ora Salmon, Buttermilk, Meyer Kosho, Cincinatti Radish: Best dish of the evening! Salmon poached just right. Flesh was cooked just right[Delicious meat option] Steak, Shitake Mushrooms, Umeboshi, Ponzu Jus: Steak was about 36mm in size. Friend described it as tender & not over-seasoned. [Pretty good] Ocean Trout, Shitake Mushrooms, Umeboshi, Ponzu: Crispy pan-fried trout in a bed of delicious buttery sauce. Flesh peeled off and cooked just right.[Ok] Cucumber Champagne de Juniper (Pre-dessert): Never heard of pre-dessert in my life, but it was the size of a chinese ceramic spoon and very refreshing. Can be consumed in 1 bite.[Meh] Strawberry, Chamomile, Orange Blossom: It was good where the whipped cream and cake was not overly sweet. The red strawberry decorations were just ok--nothing too special.[Ok] Toasted Cocoa, Hazelnuts & icecream: Nothing much to say other than it was good, and the icecream was extra creamy.====Note that the card terminals does not allow you to calculate tip before tax which is quite perplexing because it means you are being taxed for your tip. Paid around $140/person for the whole meal without alcohol which is very expensive but you get the quality you pay for.I've tried it once--liked it, but probably wouldn't come back again anytime soon.",4.0,4.0,168,2017-10-09,43.648539,-79.395937,"Bars , French"
Alo Restaurant,"So I've  been here about 5-6 times in the past couple of years. Cant believe i havent made a review after all this time. I guess its a good thing since now i can provide a pretty honest  review.Service: it deserves a 5 star it is always excellent.  They have never missed a step here servers always professional. The wine pours from the tasting is generous. No complaints here.Food is mostly good. Overall most of the dishes ive had here are  4-5 star rating. Ive had a few miss and those dish were pretty mediocre in flavour. So i can see why some folk on yelp would give it such a low rating.  After waiting for months and end up having an unfortunate bad experiance.  I guess there really no average dishes for me here either it was extremely good or just meh. The food was either too bland or not overly exciting. Maybe they are just trying too hard to keep things fresh? I would say 80% of the dishes ive had here were great and i would come back. I gave this place a 4 star rating mainly because out of all the times ive been here i remeber twice my food was just average, but the other times the food was great and it totally lived up to the 5 star rating everyone has been giving them.",4.0,4.0,168,2017-10-24,43.648539,-79.395937,"Bars , French"

Lobster Monster,"One of the selling points of coming here was all the lobster-related things - duh. On our trip to Toronto, I wanted to make sure that we would hit somewhere with a lobster roll because I'm from the middle of the US, where we're landlocked. So let me break it down for you:Landlocked = No fresh seafood = Exorbitant prices for anything seafood-relatedWe ordered the Lobster Poutine, and one of the owners encouraged us to order it with their Lobster Bisque gravy, instead of the regular gravy. I was 50/50 about it, so I let my boyfriend make the final decision. He decided to go for the Lobster Bisque gravy. What they don't tell you when they make the suggestion for it, is that there is actually an up-charge of $3. It's printed on their menu in small print. I honestly can't tell you if the poutine was better with the lobster bisque gravy. I would assume not, as I found it forgettable. So I say that you should save your $3 and not get the lobster bisque gravy. Other than that, the fries had the perfect texture, and there were plenty of cheese curds to go around. My boyfriend and I both ordered the cold Lobster Croissant Roll. I don't feel like Lobster Monster is the best place to introduce lobster rolls to someone who has never had one. But alas, I didn't realize that at the time. I found it to be average, and my boyfriend thought the same, which is too bad because it was not a great first experience for him.The owners were there, and they were extremely nice and were very conversational with the patrons in the restaurant. We came for an early dinner, so there were a lot of older folks in there, and they really enjoyed talking to the male owner. While the service was great, my only gripe is with the small water glasses. Small water glasses should be banned because they get literally nothing accomplished. Other than that, it was a good experience, though I don't think I would come back. I would likely try to find somewhere else for a lobster roll.Overall: 3/5Food: 3/5Service: 4/5Atmosphere: 2/5",4.0,3.0,66,2017-06-09,43.729753,-79.403193,Seafood
Lobster Monster,"Located in the Yonge and Lawrence area, the rather typically tacky seafood restaurant decor of Lobster Monster is made up for greatly by the brightening hospitality displayed by Marianne, one of the owners of this establishment, all the way throughout the dining experience.Of course I had to choose the lobster poutine--yes, with bisque--and needless to say it was a monstrous dish. Served with maple syrup for a dash of sweetness to top the Canadian theme, my only complaint about it is how monstrously stomach-heavy cheesy it was. Okay fine, they don't actually use cheese curds here also, but you're probably having too much lobster to care.Overall a welcoming and fun place to enjoy lobster in taco form, lobster rolls, or just plain old lobster!{TTC: Lawrence subway station, Ranleigh Ave exit.

Lobster Monster,My friends hosted a surprise birthday dinner for me here !!! The food at this restaurant are very tastey.. Alot of us order the various sized lobster dinner meal. My order of small lobster was $36 + $9 to add bruschetta + lobster bisque to make it a meal.The Bruschetta was beyond expectations.. And they give you 4 big pieces.They also ask if you would like regular or garlic butter for your lobster and i 100% recommend trying the garlic butter.We arrived quite late on a Wednesday night. Supposedly the restaurant closes at 10pm but we didn't even order until 9:30pm - however this did not affect the service at all !! The owners of this restaurant are Super friendly and nice.Overall i would recommend coming here if you feel like having a nice lobster meal.

Lobster Monster,"Summary:I expect better lobster since this is ""Lobster Monster""It seems like the lobster is used to make a higher margin.Speed Read:1) Husband and Wife Owned - Friendly.  Ask about anything2) Great: Bruschetta, Poutine with lobster bisque3) Soso: Lobster, Clam chowderEarly SeptemberGreat Service, they explained how it works, and let us change stuff on the menu.  They quickly fixed an error on the bill without hesitation.The first and best thing we have is the Bruschetta.  The fresh tomatoes combined with herb, (thymes leave), serve on a warm toast is a great start.  I didn't expect it from a lobster place.The poutine with lobster bisque and maple syrup is Unorthodox way of making poutine:- Thicken lobster bisque on fries is a good combo- maple syrup always goes well with seafood (like maple glazed salmon)- Cheese was soso, but it works- The lobster in the poutine is out of place.  it shouldn't even be there.  The lobster should stay out, but they can't charge that much if there's no lobster.Lobster on the poutine is probably frozen precooked lobster, so it only taste so so.  Clam chowder is disappointing, with not much clam taste.  Don't order, it's not worth it.We order the fresh lobster on their menu that comes with corn and baked potatoes.- Fresh lobster - Not an expert at it.  I had better fresh lobster cooked at home.  This lobster might have been starving the some time, the meat texture is a little soft.- Corn - not very good.  They claim farm fresh corn, but I expect much better corn in September- Baked potatoes...it's a potatoes serve with everything on the side.",4.0,3.0,66,2016-09-23,43.729753,-79.403193,Seafood

Lobster Monster,"Came here for husband's birthday and it was fantastic! A small place but very cozy and comfortable. We got lucky and were seated without a reservation so make a reservation if you plan on coming - especially if you're a big party. Husband started off the night by ordering a Caesar - it came with a giant prawn! I didn't get a taste but he said it was very good. Next came the bowl of lobster bisque. Our bowl came with 3 smaller bowls to share (2 adults, 1 toddler) and we drank every last drop. It's so creamy with tender pieces of lobster in it, and the lobster flavour is phenomenal!! Get this one for sure! They also offer a smaller cup size, but the bowl is definitely a bigger bang for your buck. We also got garlic bread and bruschetta which is full of fresh garlicky goodness.For our mains, I ordered Neptune's Delight Seafood Linguini. This giant plate contains 2 rock lobster tails, 3 shrimp, 3 scallops, lots of baby clams and some lobster meat all mixed in a creamy marinara sauce, served over a very generous portion of linguini. I love that there was so much seafood in this. All 3 of us ate from here and we still packed home half of it. Husband ordered Lucious Lobster White Mac and Cheese. So creamy and cheesy and utterly delicious! Another dish the three of us attempted to eat and still packed home half of it. We had no space for dessert, otherwise we would have gone for Karat cake. Definitely a must try if you're looking for lobster and/or seafood dinner. The menu is pretty extensive and there's a lot of other dishes I want to try. Next time, I will plan accordingly and bring a bunch of friends so we can all share!",4.0,4.0,66,2017-04-07,43.729753,-79.403193,Seafood

Lobster Monster,"I stumbled upon Lobster Monster on a Saturday for an early dinner with friends and was excited about what they had to offer. The menu is quite overwhelming as there are many choices. My friends had ordered the lobster bisque and were pleasantly surprised at the chunks of lobster in every spoonful. The table had a few orders of the warm croissant lobster roll which was delicious. I personally had the Neptune pasta and was amazed by the huge portion size. I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce but overall, there was lots of seafood and a generous portion given price being paid. It was also nice that we were given complimentary bruschetta and garlic bread for our large party. Overall, good food and good service!

Lobster Monster,"My family and I dined at Lobster Monster to celebrate our son's 23rd birthday. The place is really cute. I adored the clam chowder... rich and creamy, filled with clams and goodness. This was followed by Neptune's Delight which lives up to its name. Both my sons enjoyed the lobster bisque, smooth and creamy yumminess. The birthday boy ordered a medium lobster which was served with birthday candles in each of its claws.. so cute and a nice touch. My daughter-in-law had the lobster mac and cheese... a rich and decadent delight with lobster pieces throughout. There was enough to have for dinner the next evening. Lobster grilled cheese and an order of snow crab completed our dinner selections. Although we were all too full for dessert, we were treated to a piece of birthday karat cake.

Lobster Monster,"First I have to say the owners of Lobster Monster are super adorable, enthusiastic and extremely nice people!I attended a charity event at Lobster Monster for a set menu. We had the Soup, Lobster Poutine and Cold Croissant Roll, Brownie Sundae. Their lobster seemed very fresh, nicely cooked and didn't leave any ""sea"" taste to it. I lovedddd the Lobster Poutine. I would've never thought to add Maple Syrup to poutine if I haven't tried here! Definitely a must try.The croissant roll was different since they used a croissant instead of normal bread. I thought it was okay because I'm not a fan of green onions and there were lotssss of onions in here. All in all, the experience was quite good since the owners were extremely friendly and made us feel welcomed.

Lobster Monster,"My first experience here was somewhat of a disappointment. I was in the neighborhood and checked the ""nearby"" feature on Yelp, and this place popped up, with a 4-star rating. I guess my expectations were a bit too high from the start. When I walked in around 6:30pm on a Tuesday evening, there was only one other table occupied. I asked my server for some recommendations, told her which dishes looked good to me, and she pointed out the seafood linguine, stating that it's one of their most popular dishes. In hindsight, it seems odd that she would mention the popularity of a dish rather than how good it tastes. But I can understand why she said it that way; it may be popular, but it's certainly not a great dish. It definitely looks way better than it tastes. The lobster itself was dry and it was obviously previously frozen; I think it was in the freezer too long because the shell didn't even crack when I used the crackers to break the shell. It just kind of squished like it was waterlogged. The scallops were cooked very nicely but the prawns were overdone a bit. The biggest sin was lack of seasoning - it was so bland, I had to add a fair amount of salt and Parmesan cheese to coax some flavour out of the dish. At that point, I had eaten all the seafood, so I didn't feel right complaining about the dish, so I waited until I was done eating to mention something to the server. She seemed quite taken aback, but immediately questioned my ability to discern what good food tastes like, because she got quite defensive and said they'd never EVER had anyone make a negative comment about the food there. I guess she was implying there must be something wrong with ME. In any case, it prompted me to come back and read some reviews, and lo and behold, there are a few less than favourable ones on here. I guess it's not just me after all. Restaurants are empty at prime dinner time for a reason. Instead of acting defensively, perhaps consider that some customer comments might actually be valid and try to learn from the constructive criticism and incorporate some minor changes - instead of acting as though there's no room for improvement. That's how you alienate good customers. Perhaps that's why the place is pretty much empty.",4.0,2.0,66,2016-08-23,43.729753,-79.403193,Seafood

Koyoi Restaurant & Bar,"Koyoi (meaning 'tonight') is one of the earlier izakaya in Toronto by now and staffed with Japanese waitresses and has many Japanese customers, but the owner (whose wife is Japanese) is Korean. The food is quite good and coupled with everything else that makes up a pleasant dining experience and atmosphere is a 3.5/5.The izakaya's second location opened, changed names, reverted back and has shut down now so the owner has not perfected a formula, but the food is generally good (though not as tasty as in Japan) and there are a couple of rare menu items that no one else offers like motsunabe, which we ordered. This hot pot dish is made with the innards of cow or pig and adds chive, sesame, tofu, cabbage and garlic. Theirs was good, but missing flavour compared to Japan a little and definitely missing 'motsu' or offal. We were disappointed by how little meat there was in the nabemono.The gyutan or beef tongue on a hot stone is a favourite and quite good, the blowtorched saba battera is tasty and who can say no to Japanese karaage?They have a variety of sake and shochu. The service is fine and responsive. The food items arrive fairly quickly. Water refills is regular.They are always busy, which means that most people do not care about the lack of atmosphere or decoration, which is what I wanted to get into next. The L shaped izakaya is quite small, tables are next to one another and there is minimal decoration past product posters, bottles and of course signs advertising food. The washroom had its 'best before' date in 2014 probably and could use a major overhaul.At least they had not turned on the TV.Koyoi would be an A if it had a nicer interior and refocused on more authentic Japanese flavours for certain items, but as mentioned earlier is still a winner.",4.0,4.0,108,2017-11-19,43.666679,-79.385468,"Japanese , Bars"
Koyoi Restaurant & Bar,"What a hidden gem! I was craving izakaya food and found Koyoi on Yelp. We walked in on a Friday night and were lucky enough to grab two of their last few bar seats. I would recommend making reservations here if you don't want to wait. Upon entering the restaurant we heard a lot of Japanese dialogue - definitely brought us back to Japan! The space is small and cozy, and by no means extravagant which we thoroughly enjoyed. Compared to an izakaya like Kinka or Guu, Koyoi is much more toned down and less lively.Great selection of shareable plates! Between the two of us, we had:1) A bottle of Sake - Why not?2) Beef tataki - Good, but a bit on the sour side from the sauce (which I personally didn't mind)3) Scallop carpaccio - Scallops were so fresh and I loved the salad & dressing!4) Deep fried oysters - Crisp batter and comes with a pink tartar sauce5) Chicken karaage - Not too oily, tasty after squeezing some lemon juice on top6) Beef steak cubes on hot plate - This was so good and cooked perfectly, especially delicious with the dip it came with!7) Spicy fries with curry and melted cheese - Nothing too special but I am tempted to recreate this at home!Overall, it was a great experience and I can't wait to go back to try out more things on their menu!",4.0,5.0,108,2017-11-04,43.666679,-79.385468,"Japanese , Bars"

The creaminess of the tofu and savoury bonito flakes balanced with a light salad is so flavourful yet guilt-free. I can eat this salad forever.

Koyoi Restaurant & Bar,"Admittedly I am a little biased since I do judge a restaurant by the cover and Koyoi, despite being moderately spacious and even has a patio, is really generic and ratchet looking. I like traditional Japanese-style seats at izakayas for the full experience, but here the tables and seats are plastic (?) and really feels like a big hole in the wall (nothing wrong with that).Food- 4/5. Excellent, but not the best. Kintaro and Kinka Izakayas still do it better. Koyoi uses a lot of soy sauce.In order of favorites from most to least:1. Koyoi salad - Our favorite since it was huge and comes with greens, bonito flakes, mayo, fresh tofu, and root vegetable chips (beets, lotus). It does get very salty at the bottom since it's mostly soy sauce.2. Japanese style omelette - 5 egg rolls that were light, fluffy, and slightly sweet! Comes with a blob of minced Daikon. Small portion size.3. Scallop salad - The raw scallops tasted like nothing, but the salad also came with greens, tomatos, and seaweed. Above average portion size.4. Seared Mackerel - My gf hated this, said it smelled too fishy to consume. I personally liked it for being fully marinated (the flavor was really in there, but mostly it was salty) and the texture was more cooked than raw, so felt like I was eating beef. The portion size is small.5. Grilled Eggplant - eggplant will be eggplant, but luckily Koyoi tried to flavor it up by adding bonito flakes on top. The presentation is interesting - it looked like a fish! Value- 5/5. No, it's not cheap, but for an izakaya this is probably as good as it gets downtown. My girlfriend and I ordered 5 dishes and 0 drinks and spent $23 each here last night for dinner. Some of the portion sizes are huge - namely, the fries and the Koyoi salad. Even the scallop salad was quite large (I was expecting a small dipping bowl of marinated scallops). Other dishes are quite small, like the seared mackerel, but since it is quite richly flavored/salty you feel filled up. The food menu items range from $2 for oden to $12-15 for grilled seafood. There's also a $5 per item happy hour deal on Tuesday-Thursday between 5-6PM. Too bad we came on Friday :'(Service- 4/5. Very friendly, minor language barrier that made no impact on ordering.Venue- 4/5. QUIET (despite being a Friday night) and sufficiently spacious. As you may know from my Kinka review, being able to converse in an izakaya and sit comfortably (i.e. stretch my legs) are key. They also have a sidewalk patio. If bringing a large group, do call to make a reservation in advance as space does fill up.Will be back one day!",4.0,4.0,108,2017-04-08,43.666679,-79.385468,"Japanese , Bars"
Koyoi Restaurant & Bar,"Excellent place, hidden gem.  Certainly a place I'd recommend anyone who wants to try out Japanese food but not necessarily default to sushi and sashimi (sushi/sashimi is always bomb, but sometimes one must broaden their horizons).  I would say that this is a place where you want to have a few friends with you, as their focus is on Japanese tapas, and with multiple friends you have a bit of spending power.Atmosphere/Service: the restaurant is very tiny, but it's very cosy.  Given the small space, waitresses are visible and they themselves are attentive.   Waitresses are courteous and came by a few times to ensure that we were ok, consistently providing water and there to take our order.  Food: So my friends and I essentially ordered a majority of Koyoi's top 5 dishes.  The Koyoi salad, just fyi, is something that you order for yourself, for several reasons...the portion size, the unique blend of dressing, and ingredients in there.  You could basically say that in itself can serve as your ""main dish"" while you share everything.  All in all, Koyoi's salad is excellent, hearty and very unique from other restaurants.  Definitely recommend for anyone coming to Koyoi.The weakest dish was probably the chicken karaage.  For one the batter just seems really bland and basic.  Not my favouriteWe ordered the beef tongue which was excellent, initially I thought it was really salty, but I probably just got one that was salty, as the other pieces tasted delicious.  It was served on a sizzling hot plate and the texture was not overcooked as I normally fear with a lot of hot plate stuff.  Would order againScallop carpaccio was delicious, they were pretty fresh and the combination of the salad with the dressing match beautifully.Beef Tataki: very strong flavour, it's very vibrant and counteracts with the rawness of the beef, I liked it but overall, the flavour kind of one-dimensional (still good, but not as many notes as I hoped).Onigiri, I got the benito one, they serve it with a side of pickles and it's soooo good with it together.  Super yummy, I dunno...it know onigiri is basically a ball of rice wrapped in nori, but I like rice....so yeah.Overall, very enjoyable meal, and I'd love to try out other items on the menu.  Would definitely come back!",4.0,4.0,108,2017-08-15,43.666679,-79.385468,"Japanese , Bars"

It's easy to forget about this place amidst the explosion of izakaya joints and ramen houses around town, but this place is a real gem. The last time I was there was a week ago.

As for the food, I still maintain they make the best matcha cheesecake in the city. The texture is it's so perfectly smooth, slightly firm and oh so Velvety, it's a perfect bite of food. Other great options are the koyoi salad with very enjoyable sweet potato crisps, beef tataki, raw scallop ceviche, karaage or when they have it fried chicken cartilage which is my favorite.

Koyoi Restaurant & Bar,"I came here randomly one night with friends even though I've walked by it a number of times over the 10 years that I've lived nearby. I just never had an inclination to walk in because from the outside, this place looks really ""meh"". I was quite surprised that the experience inside was nothing like what you'd expect from the outside.This place is usually full on the weekends and the week nights, but because it's not as well-known as the other izakaya places, you never really have to wait too long. It is a small place, but that gives the entire bar/restaurant that cozy feel. I absolutely adore the servers and the bartenders. They are all very friendly and chatty. Feel free to sit by the bar and strike up a conversation with the bartenders - they all seem like they genuinely like talking to people, and just after coming a few times, we're already on a first-name basis with the staff.If you're looking for an authentic Japanese izakaya experience, this is the closest thing you'll find in Toronto. Guu/Kinka and all their variants are not what you would typically find in Japan. My only concern is that if this place does become quite popular, the wait times are going to become absurd, as the whole restaurant probably can't fit more than 20 people.In terms of the food and drinks, they are generally good. Not everything on their menu is ""omg fantastic"", but they do have a few stand-out dishes: The beef tataki, gyu-tan (grilled beef tongue), udon, ochazuke (porridge), and beef steak are all excellent choices that I would recommend. If you want something really special, order the motsunabe (hot pot) - a perfect dish for the winter and the portions are generous. The bartenders also have a good taste for drinks, and makes excellent cocktails - just ask for some suggestions and I'm sure they'll whip up something great for you. The overall price of the restaurant is fair, and it is slightly cheaper than your average izakaya restaurant in Toronto - but it isn't super cheap either ($30/person for enough food and drinks).If you ever decide to come here on a weekend, you'll likely find me at the bar with a lot of food in front of me.

Tilt,"Tilt is a super chill and casual arcade bar that has a great selection of retro gaming machines! All of their games are free to play as well, so there's no need to search for the change machine. Just pay the $5 cover fee and play until your heart's content =) The arcade selection has many of your classics from the 80's and early 90's, and includes titles such as Pacman, Donkey Kong, Street Fighter and the like. They also have a good selection of pinball machines which were all in good working order. Despite the high usage of their games, every arcade cabinet was well maintained and worked smoothly. A great thing to see since most of these things are rare treasures now =)Tilt also has a huge selection of beers and drinks on their menu, with the average pint costing only $7. The food here seemed popular as well, though I didn't get to try any of it on my first visit.Overall, a great place to grab a drink and experience some nostalgia with old school games! Best to come early on weekends if you want to avoid lineups though-the place gets packed and lively at night =)",4.0,5.0,72,2017-10-20,43.665357,-79.406982,"Arcades , Bars , Latin American"
Tilt,"Nostalgic arcade and videos games with good bar food and a modest alcohol selection.5/5 - Venue3.5/5 - Food & Drinks4/5 - OverallI visited this bar on an early Friday night, at around 8:30pm. Cover was $5 and that includes all the games inside which are free to play. Coat check is a separate cost. This place gets uncomfortably packed around 11:00pm, so plan accordingly.Venue: The bar is located on a quiet stretch of Brunswick Ave. near Bloor st. You might even miss it given how quiet the area is. There is an front area for you to smoke and get some fresh air, as the inside of the bar can get humid. The walls of the bar are lined with pinball machines, and other arcade games although a good 40% of them are just pinball machines. There are two TVs with gaming systems; one seems to be a Gamecube and the other a Sega. There's a bar near the front, and at the back there's a small counter serving a limited selection of food and snacks. There's live music playing, and a few standing tables but no dance area. Tons of people chatting and having a drink though.Food & Drinks: I can only comment on the dill pickled fries, which you can see in my photo. They were delightfully prepared in a pickle brine, then gives them a tangy salty crunch after frying. There's a mediocre selection of beers on tap with a couple local brewers and other common imports. I don't think there were any cocktails available, or at least nothing too fancy. Definitely not a place to enjoy a meal, as there are very limited food offerings, and limited seating.Overall: This place is a must-go for the experience and the few hours of fun with the arcade games. However, with many of the machines being just pinball, you might lose interest. As the night wore on near 11:00pm the bar became very crowded, almost to the point of a club. There were no where to walk without needing to squeeze past people or bump into them. There were lines for all the machines, and the inside became quite warm and humid. I decided to leave soon after, as we had played all the games we wanted, and saw no point in socializing while standing up, packed like sardines in a can.",4.0,4.0,72,2018-01-29,43.665357,-79.406982,"Arcades , Bars , Latin American"
Tilt,"Tilt is so much fun! Lots of old 80s and 90s games, especially great if you're nostalgic!All the games are free to play, just pay the $5 cover. I think it's totally worth it. We didn't try any of the food, but the beer was not bad! Maybe next time we go. The only thing is that a bunch of the games were broken when we went, and the crocodile smashing game is totally rigged! And the Skee ball at the back only has one ball, so each game takes forever. Still it's so much fun! They have a game console and couch too, it was probably an N64? Not sure though, it was really dark!

It's because it's $5 cover, and then it's unlimited free play for all the games inside! They had a good selection of pinball games and retro style arcade games. They're the same as the other generic barcades that I've visited in other cities, with the exception of the free play for a cover where as others are either pay by token per game, or has a drink requirement. They had a DJ there on Saturday night playing rock/electronic music so that changed the vibe a little bit. Even though it was really crowded, we were still able to play a good selection of the games.

Tilt,"Men never outgrow their childhood obsessions, for hubby it's gaming. Came to Tilt to drag hubby out of his doldrums. If you want to avoid paying for parking, find one of the side streets where parking is free after 9pm.$2 Tuesdays covers entrance and full use of all games, no quarters needed here; but you'll need to show ID at the door. $2 coat check as you enter, you'll pay the cover charge here then get your hand stamped. Saw so many of our favorites: Asteroids, Donkey Kong, Area 51, Street Fighter, and so many more. They also had pinball machines, Foosball and table hockey. On both ends of the place they had couches where you and your friends can play games like Mario Brothers. Let's not forget those consoles where you can sit across from your opponent like Pac Man.  I'm not a gamer (anymore) so I thought I'd tryout their food. You order and pay at the bar, they give you a number, you have a seat at a table and they bring the food to you.ORDERED- Coke - flat and sweet- Contra Medianoche sandwich - avocado cheese, tomato arugula and peach mayo: tasty. - Punched Out Pulled Pork - Woodhouse Stout pulled pork with a grilled pineapple and Chipotle mayo: juicy and full of flavor. They could use a better, fresher bun.Food was decent for the price. Staff wasn't the warmest but they were helpful and efficient. Open till the wee hours of the morning.

Do you like video games? This is where you wanna be. Just down for some nostalgia? Tilt got your back. 90's baby feeling a little old? Tilt will console you. (Pun intended)While seating is limited, the amount of games and pinball machines makes up for it. There seems to be more pinball machines than video games, but nothing is repetitive and there's a good variety to keep you entertained for a few hours. They have old school games like: TMNT, Pac-Man, donkey Kong, space invaders!!!!, street fighter, tron, and so much more, in great condition too. There are also two couches with consoles set up! SNES at the front, and n64 at the back. Too bad even with the house rules on courtesy and 'sharing', in the 3-4 hours we were there, the same people stayed on the n64 lounge the entire time.  Craft beers are cheap, mixed drinks not so much. Still pretty standard for a bar. They offer snacks like fries, pop corn, corn dogs, poutine, coney dogs, nachos - the kind of food you'd kick back to with a beer and some video games! It gets busyyy on weekends, with long lines. But kudos to the staff/security for great crowd management! I can definitely appreciate this, versus businesses overcrowding to maximize on revenue.

Tilt,"I came here on a Saturday with a group of friends for a birthday. We arrived at 10pm and waited outside for about 40mins. I'm glad that they limited the amount of people into the bar because it is fairly small and it can get cramped and hot pretty quick. The cover is $5 and included unlimited arcade game play. There were an entire wall of pinball machines, classic games like street fighter, bust a move, super Mario world, etc. It was fun but hard to play games with everyone as we were a party of 8 people. I can totally see this place as a fun date idea though. I didn't try the food here as I had a big dinner beforehand but my friends who did order food, enjoyed it. The drinks here are decent if you just want beer or hard liquor. They didn't have ingredients to make cocktails though.

The place is next to greenP parking which is 4$ an hour, with no maximum limit, so park somewhere else, you are gonna spend at least 3-4 hours here. Then pay the cover charges, on by cash-5$ per person. Fair enough, coz now you are into game zone, and which are all covered . All you need to find the machine/ game table to play. Its too much fun. Drinks and food are priced very reasonable, there are many vegan/ vegetarian options . I loved the veggie Chicago dog- Overloaded with toppings! Chickpea curry was okay, pop-corns and fries fine too. But who whose to Tilt for food. It is a place for Arcade games. And I was surprised by the crowd on a week night. I assume weekends would be a line up there.But I enjoyed a lot.

Tilt,"Someone say blast from the past? This place is absolutely incredible and so much fun. The place is pretty dope. The bar/club is packed with retro old school arcade games back from the early 80's and 90's. You get to pretty much relive your childhood in playing, Street Fighter 2, TRON, Ninja Turtles (gotta play that!!), Jitz, Nintendo 64, Wack-A-Mole, NES, old school pinball and many more! All the games are free so no need bring in a bag load of 25 cents to keep continuing if you fail at a game. That is one the of most awesome features. You're able to play the game until your done (and potentially hog the entire machine) lol. Came here on Friday which is their peak days including weekends and cover was $5 (That is really cheap!). Usually only Monday and Tuesdays are the cheapest days. Mondays is free cover and Tuesdays is $2 (Toonie Tuesday). They always got a DJ spinning new music and old school beats. There is a mini area to order food and a bar for drinks. Drinks are pretty good but typical at any other clubs/bars you may go to within Toronto. The place is pretty small, so when it gets busy the places gets packed and there really little room to walk around places and squeeze into playing a game because right in the centre of the place are long tables and couple of chairs where most people tend to chill, or nearby a game they are waiting for. So my suggestion is if you want to play a game you have to budge in for it and zip in when the last person is about to leave or else someone else will take over and you'll never get a chance to play.

Tilt,"Such a dope place. Tilt, thank you for blessing Toronto with your presence. Great selection on tap, a laid-back vibe (other than the competitive spirit in the air), and a crazy selection of old-school pinball machines and arcade games. My friend and I came right as they opened - 6pm - on a Friday night, but this new business has clearly already struck the hearts of the community, because it was swinging in no time. Awesome awesome selection of two player games, so definitely come in pairs/quads/hundreds. Actually not the last one, because I wouldn't want a lineup at my favourite of the night - the Street Fighter II Champion Edition pinballer. I know so many people who would love this place, and you betcha I'm coming back with 'em. It takes a special kind of establishment where I'm certain you could have fun with anyone. Even if you don't like them, even if it's an awkward first date (it wasn't tonight - a date or awkward), you're going to have a blast (especially if drinks are involved). $5 cover is nothing compared to the entertainment value of this super unique gem.

More pinball machines, so that was a nice change from some other places. Amongst the games you got classics like Tetris, Donkey Kong, Ms Pacman, TMNT, Pacman, Bubble Bobble, Bust a Move/Puzzle Bobble and Mario Bros. In addition, I saw a classic NES console, a N64 as well, and a foosball table. I will say that some games got stuck but overall they were well maintained.Overall, a cool place to hang with a different change of pace. Came on a Sunday before dinner and it was pretty quiet.

Tilt,"So far my only 5-star review on Yelp, and very deserving of it! This place has amazing cheap food, great games that are free (after the $5 cover) and a very fun crowd.The first time I went, we were met by a lot of fun, sharing people - half drunk and wanting to play furiously competitive Mario Kart, or challenging me and a friend to some soccer/foosball. The bouncer does count heads as you enter, but it was pretty packed. In a good way, however, as there was still place to sit and eat and games to play. The second time I went, however, there was a birthday party going on with some very obnoxious players of Mario Kart, who hogged the Nintendo 64 in the back. Of course this isn't reflected in the rating, because it's not the fault of Tilt itself, but I was just disappointed that fully-functioning (sober, I might add) adults seemed to not know how to share things. They would only give up a controller to another part of their pack and didn't even give up couch space for anyone. Anyways. The food is great! Mostly under $6 (? I believe), hot steaming corn dogs, chili fries (SOO GOOD) and pretty filling grub all around. Drinks were not too bad either, I think my friends paid about $6 a shot? Which was alright.All in all, I'm definitely going to miss this place if it does end up coming down at the end of the year...hope they can win their legal battle.

Tilt,"Baby, this is what I came forLightning strikes every time I playEverybody's watching me play But I'm looking at the screen (or silver ball)boom boom boom wakka wakka ding ding ding cha chingI'm old school and I know itYou know I'm old school because how I write and what I sayThat's OK because I don't mind itAnd that's not a roll of quarters/loonies/toonies in my pocketAll you can play games - no coins required.Here at Tilt you do not need a roll of coins unless you intend on paying for your cover or food with it.  On a Friday evening the cover charge I paid was 5 dollars at the bar because I came early enough that somebody wasn't at the front door/coat check.  You can check your coat here but there's a few hooks to hang it inside but not many but you can get one if you're early enough.  I was early as usual.  This place is newly opened (3rd weekend) and it was featured in the Metro (or the other paper on the subway) as well as on BlogTO.  Honestly I discovered on BlogTO and I I knew when it hit that medium it was going to take off.The Annex is one of my favorite hoods in the city that being it's on the west side it's in my favorite zone in that I consider my zone the west side between Ossington and Bathurst and between Bloor and Dundas.  Places to eat and drink?  Yup... that pretty much sums up why I like this area and always have.  NOW, add one of the coolest places in my zone and now you have a glorified place to hang out and have fun.  Chalk this one up for the Annex because the cool wow factor just leveled up.They have a bunch of snacks revolving around hot dogs and fries.  Chip truck style fries yes, but I had the chili cheese fries and I have to say they are really good for a place that has multiple pinball machines.  While there's countless options to have a bite in the area Tilt serves up dogs done up Chicago style (not sure if they use sport peppers are not, they are impossible to find in Toronto for some strange unknown reason), corndogs, fries and while we ordered at the bar, I was given a number to take to the table and the food was brought to us when it was ready.  They have vegetarian options so if a beef dog is not preferable you can go with other options.  Non-meat options are clearly stated on the menu (fries, veggie dogs) etc.The bar is a full bar.  Craft beers on tap as well as cans, bottles and other drinks are also served within reasonable price range as well so hey, why not get a couple pints to make the experience complete?  As far as nostalgia goes there's a couch right to the right of the main entrance.  There's a wall display of dozens of original Nintendo games and a console of some sorts there.  In the back there's a N64 with a couch and a big screen tv.  As far as pinball games there's a wide range of variety from old 50's and 60's type machines to ones that are under a decade old to ones from the 90's or so.  There's 3 table top games opposite the bar such as Tetris, Galaga, Ms PacMan and standup machines make up the bulk of the game room along the edges of the opposing walls along the stretch of the main room.  All in all I think I counted about 40ish games For non pinball and coin op games there's skee ball at the very back wall sort of hidden as well as a whack a mole type game near the front not far from the Star Wars pinball game.While my gang arrived earlier in the evening when it was not very busy and basically you could have at it to anything you wanted to play.  As the evening progressed the place got packed.  It wasn't necessarily as if you couldn't play a game but maybe there was a wait as almost every game was occupied.  That's to sort of be expected seeing how popular this place is and will become.  There's shallow counters and high seating behind the games so if you had to put your drink somewhere that would be the safest.  There's a few small tables between the games. U of T gang welcome to what we GenX grew up with but feel lucky because it wasn't a flat fee and we didn't have a bar to make things nicer... we were kids so ya no drinking for us.  Also this place didn't seem shady at all like the arcades that used to be along Yonge and Dundas decades ago.All around Tilt for me is the absolute coolest place I've been to in a very long time.  Rachel McAdams, you're a lucky girl to live so close to a cool place like Tilt.",4.0,5.0,72,2016-12-05,43.665357,-79.406982,"Arcades , Bars , Latin American"

THE FOOD: The food is Japanese small plates style which are composed to both look beautiful and taste amazing. While we were impressed with everything we chose, the dino wings and Nasu Dengaku particularly stood out.THE DRINK: We both ordered cocktails even though we usually find them overpriced and overrated. But we both loved our choices and enjoyed the unique flavours.THE SPACE: This place is tiny and eccentric- industrial warehouse with pharmacy-inspired decor. I found that the aesthetic didn't do much for me. I also didn't love that we were seated at a tiny, wobbly table with vintage (read-uncomfortable) chairs.

Hanmoto,"This place is great, but I might be understating things.  Dishes ordered : Moto eggs - just order this one - you will suffer order regret if you don't. Salmon Aburi - I loved the DIY aspect of this dish - it was just fun to assemble and eat. Dyno Wings - this one was good - but I didn't enjoy it as much as the Moto Eggs or the Salmon AburiMoto Bun - I personally felt that this was a miss in comparison to other dishes - it didn't stand out as much as the others. I did like the spicy kick in it, but overall - I would give this one a miss. Natsu Dengaku - this was good, decent balance of flavors; however didn't stand out as much as some of the others dishes. Cocktails Arisaka Sour - this was sooo good and refreshing. I loved how it tasted and it was very well made. Cops & Rabas - this is a wonderful cocktail to start your meal - it is very citrusy and just a slight hit of sourness to get the tastebuds going. Space : Seating allows for only about 22/25 people give or take. We got here just after opening and we were lucky enough to snag two of the four seats at the bar. Note: this place is the type of place you bring on the nights you can/want to do something different and on a night you want to relive your life before kids. Lighting is dim to dark, unless you are sitting at the seats in front of the prep bar - where the lighting is slightly better. Service is friendly and the pacing of the food is well-timed. If you are two people - they do recommend about 4/5 dishes - so ratio-expect to order about two dishes per person give or take. Pricing - including the alcohol just under $90 - for us; which overall is extremely reasonable.

The icecream itself has miso in it, and sprinkled with dry seaweed. Other dishes we tried and loved: fried wings and the moto bun. Fried wings have a lot of batter but it is flavourful and crunchy. Highly recommend!Atmosphere is great for dating (especially first few dates). Light is dim, and you do feel like you are in one of those alley bars in Tokyo.Also: DO NOT ORDER Hamachi Tartare.

Hanmoto,"What to try?Their Dino wings, the eggplant, the salmon aburi and the miso ice cream!I was introduced to this restaurant from my brother and at first I had trouble finding this place, but I was able to locate it after I saw a few ppl coming out from a door. The restaurant doesn't have a sign so you can't really see it if you're driving by because it's a dive bar. Like its sister restaurant pinkys and odd Seoul, the restaurant runs with a dive bar atmosphere. The restaurant isn't too big and it fits at most 25 ppl and this includes people sitting at the bar! At first I wasn't too optimistic about the food, however my skepticism was soon overcame with the tasty dishes I was served. I liked the uniqueness of the Dino wings because it's essentially dumpling stuffed wings! I also liked the eggplant because of the way they mixed all the ingredients together. I liked the salmon aburi because it was very tasty and miso ice cream was unique!Last tip?Be prepared to wait for a table! It's a really small restaurant and it's located just off college street but it's really popular with the locals. The good thing is they will take down your name and phone number so you can roam off to a bar and grab a drink while you wait for your call!",4.0,5.0,138,2017-07-20,43.649661,-79.422681,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Hanmoto,Made a point to arrive just as they opened on a weekday as the few tables will fill up within a half hour. The pork dumpling stuffed boneless Dyno Wings are a must. The Moto Eggs were good but nothing mind blowing. The Salmon Aburi was excellent. Definitely worth a return trip to try the other selections.This is a very small place with a dirty bathroom and some food preparation happening in a stairwell on the way to said bathroom upstairs.

Hanmoto,"Great food. Really cool vibe and decor. Good beers I like the ace hill in cans and Brooklyn lager on tap. We tried the salmon, hamachi and uni bomb from the raw menu. Favourite was the hamachi but all were fantastic to be honest. The fried eggplant was tasty too. We also ordered the wings - with the pork/scallion dumpling fused into the drumstick. Pretty epic! Their sweet soy sauce was awesome on the salmon - which came with wasabi, seaweed and little crispy chicken skin chips. I think we got lucky with the seating - showed up at 8pm and happened upon a great table open for the 4 of us. The rest of the evening a constant stream of people arrived to a full restaurant. They left their cell numbers and were called back when space opened up. Not a big space and definitely popular.",4.0,5.0,138,2017-04-16,43.649661,-79.422681,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Hanmoto,"Just when we thought we couldn't easily be surprised any more by food in Toronto, we stumbled upon this fabulous place that is like a dive bar crossed with an izakaya, and the venue and food are both brilliant.

Hanmoto,"Tucked away on a small street off ossington with barely a sign, this place oooooozes in coolness. Inside its dark and industrially decorated, with photocopied handwritten menus. Its also a really small place. we (table for 2) got there fairly early on a Friday night around 6.30pm, so we were quickly seated at the bar after about 10 minutes. They also dont have space to hang your jacket anywhere so theres basically a pile on top of a keg in the corner. Loved sitting at the bar watching the food and drinks being made. Everyone gets the Aburi Salmon, a good sized serving of fish, but way too much mayo for my liking. But the slightly torched crips on top added a great smokey flavour. But the Dyno Wings are the best, sticky, sweet and savory. They are large and meaty, crispy and saucy its just a whole lot of deliciousness going on. The service was good, young, hip but friendly enough, a few sentence exchanges but then back to the im too cool look. This place is good but very hyped up, Im not running to come back but I would again",4.0,4.0,138,2017-04-07,43.649661,-79.422681,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Hanmoto,"After reading articles online, looking at instagram pics, and seeing the Yelp reviews, I was so excited for Hanmoto. The location is pretty cool. It's not real obvious and is hanging out on a residential street. It's dark and doesn't have obvious signage, so it's kinda fun. It's very low-key and does not have a fancy or pretentious atmosphere. As for the food menu, come prepared to spend a lot for small portions (think tapas), but at least I had the USD to CAD exchange rate on my side! The food menu is split into ""raw"" (= cold) and hot items. We ordered a bit from each, a total of 8 different dishes. My 3 favorites were: moto eggs, salmon aburi, and miso ice cream. The moto eggs are like Japanese style deviled eggs. Creamy filling, topped with roe and a piece of chicken skin. YUM. The salmon aburi is basically a deconstructed salmon aburi sushi roll. It's served as a mountain of sushi rice that is covered on all sides with salmon pieces. Then, you put some rice and salmon in a small sheet of seaweed, top it with a drizzle of soy sauce, roll it up, and stuff it in your mouth. It was very tasty and fun to eat. The miso ice cream was definitely the stand out! It was creamy and rich without being too sweet. The toppings of arare pieces and seaweed powder made for nice textural components. My least favorite items were the buns. We got both the katsu bun and the moto bun. I didn't like that the coco bread was deep fried--it just felt greasy and unnecessarily indulgent. On top of that, the buns were overfilled with cole slaw and dripping with mayo. One small bite of each was more than enough for me. People have also raved about the dynowings. They're not spicy, so don't let the name deter you. I thought they were decent, but too salty and overly fried for my taste. Not sure why they are served in a box. I'm really glad I went to Hanmoto, but for me, it's just a place worth trying once.",4.0,3.0,138,2017-01-02,43.649661,-79.422681,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Hanmoto,"I came here with friends last week and we were easily able to get a table for 7 when we walked in close to 6:30pm on a Friday night. Hanmoto has a cool hole in the wall type vibe to it and we've easily passed by this place a few times before, not knowing it was Hanmoto. It's a small place that reminds me of OddSeoul, another whole in the wall place I like.I ordered wings (the special that night, not the dynowings on the menu) and the pork belly sandwich. The wings had a nice light sweetness with mild spice flavour to it and paired with the spicy mayo type sauce, it was flavourful. The pork belly sandwich was a bit of a disappointment as it didn't taste like pork belly to me - more like a bland burger. Another friend ordered this too and he agreed. Others tried the deviled eggs and raw fish dishes - they were happy with their orders overall. The food was definitely pleasing to the eye but I'm not a fan of raw dishes so the aesthetic look of my friends' dishes were not enough to convince me to try it.The miso ice cream (it looks like a stick of butter) was good - worth a try! It was creamy with a touch of seaweed flavour to it - can't say I've tried anything like it. We got two for the table to share among all of us. Four of us ate one stick of miso ice cream and we each had several bites of it - more than enough to share.Overall, a good experience here that night. Food was pretty to look at but the portions are small for the price (typical TO!) and be prepared to spend a bit more for this Japanese tapas place. There are some hits but some misses with the taste of some of the dishes. Good company made the night a bit more though than the food for me personally.",4.0,3.0,138,2017-02-25,43.649661,-79.422681,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Hanmoto,"Hanmoto is one of those restaurants that you're excited to come back to before you've even left. I absolutely loved the vibe here, very intimate, very grungy and very true to those hole in the wall bars or street food stalls you find in Tokyo. The food didn't disappoint either, it's Japanese style snack food but not snack sized, so most dishes are shareable. Everything is quite cheap so we ended up ordering almost everything on the menu. The casual, intimate atmosphere with a great selection of food is why I would rank this joint as one of the best date spots.Standouts to me were the Dyno Wings, deep friend, de-boned, and stuffed with pork & bacon. The Salmon Aburi which I could've eaten forever. The Moto Bun, mainly because the bun itself was so soft and delicious. I do caution that there's very limited seating, especially for big groups, so call ahead and make a reservation.",4.0,4.0,138,2017-12-03,43.649661,-79.422681,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Hanmoto,"Two words: Dyno. Wings. Also: So. Great. We visited on a Friday evening at 6:00 PM (right when they opened), and overall, great experience! Just keep your eyes peeled - there's no sign on the door, but rest assured, they are the restaurant located on the northwest corner of Dundee Street and Lakeview Avenue - the one that looks like an entrance to a back kitchen, but is really the main entrance to the restaurant. First, parking. We actually found free parking in the area on one of the residential streets a block north of the restaurant. It wasn't too difficult to find at all, and there were a good amount of spots available on a Friday evening.Second, ambiance. Hipster, rustic - a little bit of country but a lot of hip. It isn't very big and doesn't seat more than 20 people (if that). It's very intimate (read: dim lights, a nice date night spot, but still nice and laid-back). It's also very casual and good for a small group hang. Third, the food. We ordered Dyno Wings ($8.00), Moto Bun ($7.00), Nasu Dengaku - Japanese Eggplant ($8.00), Salmon Aburi ($10.00), Miso Steak ($20.00). Overall - delicious. Don't expect massive portions since this is, of course, a tapas-style menu. But, almost everything we had was delicious. The Dyno Wings (i.e. wings stuffed with dumplings (!!!)) were juicy and delicious, the Moto Bun was small but tasty, the Salmon Aburi was a highlight and it was fun putting it together (they serve your seaweed wrap separately, so you can spoon the salmon on the wraps to your liking). We wouldn't get the Miso Steak again - dry and flavourless. But overall, delicious food!We would definitely come back here again!

Hanmoto,"Hanmoto is a fusion restaurant on Lakeview specializing in mixing Japanese and western flavours. Hanmoto looks like a small dive bar with its bare brick walls. The set up invokes the street food vibes of Southeast Asia where you order food at a small food stall and eat the food on the curb, standing or squatting on a small table. This is quite fitting seeing as Hanmoto is serving a lot of ""street food"". I would recommend visiting Hanmoto with a group of friends so you can sample a few plates. One of the standout plate is the Dyno wings which is Hanmoto's signature dish. The Dyno wings are deboned chicken wings stuffed with ground pork and bacon then deep fried to a crisp. The Dyno wings are served in a cute Chinese take-out box with Kewpie mayo drizzled over top along with nori, cilantro and hot peppers. Other plates that I would recommend include the katsu bun and hamachi tartare.  I would recommend paying Hanmoto a visit if you want to visit a fusion restaurant that's unique and out of the ordinary.",4.0,4.0,138,2017-10-30,43.649661,-79.422681,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Hanmoto,"Holy crap, this place was the literal definition for a hole in the wall. There wasn't even a sign outside telling you the name of the place. WHERE IT IS: If you're on the north side of Dundas and you are standing at The Beer Store, it's on the other side of the street. Look for an area that has a long wooden chair besides a door right before the area becomes residential. Go through that door. You should see the restaurant inspection sign that says hanmoto from outside.Walking in, it's pretty dark inside, but they have an interesting vibe. Their menu was small and their alcohol selection was about the same size.We ordered the eggs, hamachi tartare and their chicken wings. They were all excellent. The eggs were probably the best in taste and they did take a lot of care in preparing the eggs to make it look like the daruma doll's that were on our tables! I do like their chicken wings, it was fried well, but there were a wing or so that wasn't as juicy. As for the hamachi tartare, that was also nice and i liked the sweet chili, but i got too full by then. The portion sizes aren't that big, I had a small meal beforehand. This place is good if I took a friend who wants to drown their sorrows.Service: 4.5 / 5Food: 4.5 / 5Price Point: 3.5 / 5Overall: 4 / 5It's on the tad-higher end on price, but the food was pretty tasty and flavorful.

Hanmoto,"Super hip bar, very cool vibes, unique food concepts, but maybe not all of them are well executed in my opinion. Got here around 8pm on a Saturday night, and got a little bit lost because this restaurant doesn't have a sign! Just FYI its the place with the glowing red lights adjacent to the Beer Store. Kinda confusing but also kinda cool. We went inside and realized it was actually super tiny and packed. Luckily my friend is a regular and prepared other plans for us as he knew that there is always a wait. After leaving our names with the very friendly hostess we went close by for drinks while we waited for our call 45 mins later. The place inside as aforementioned is very small but I guess that makes it feel way more exclusive. The interior is dark with cool red and blue lights giving me kind of steam punk grungy vibes. The menu is quite small but we opted for the okra, the salmon aburi, hamachi tartare, the eggplant dish, and the ever so coveted dynowings. Despite being so busy, each dish came out rapidly. The okra came first and was covered in teriyaki sauce and bonito. Usually I love this flavour combination but I found the teriyaki sauce was just sooooo salty that my lips started tingling. Next up was the tartare which I thought tasted very fresh and very simple. I love simple don't get me wrong. But when its $8 for barely a handful of food, I kind of expect something a little more innovative.After this the salmon aburri arrived and this was IMO the BEST dish. The rice was nice and moist with what I think was mayo, fish was fresh and the combination with the nori was just spectacular. While it closely resembles regular sushi rolls. I think it was genius that they decided to separate the main part with the nori as it allowed for more sauce without ruining the crispy seaweed. The smoky torched salmon was also a great touch. Definitely recommend this one! (We ate it so fast there's no picture!)Last up was the DYNOWINGS! And yea this is pretty cool that they stuffed this much meat into a little wing but I thought while the skin was fried perfectly, the actual ""dumpling meat' was very plain on its own. WAIT I almost forgot the eggplants. You'll love it if you love eggplant. Deliciously grilled with interesting fried shredded beets on top. Can't say too much as I'm not a big eggplant person but I though the beets was very creative and brought the dish to another level.Overall, very cool place with some interesting dishes but be prepared to spend some dough if you expect to be full.",4.0,4.0,138,2017-10-16,43.649661,-79.422681,"Japanese , Asian Fusion"
Hanmoto,"Came here on a Monday night and had dinner in.  It's a small space and it doesn't look like they take reservations.  Normally, I would give this place 4 stars as I was not impressed with their service (more explained below) but the food and atmosphere was so great that one star for those sections were not enough.  I'd absolutely come back here again and again (this may have to be a new Toronto staple).  Food: The restaurant is Japanese Izakaya which is basically Japanese style Tapas.  The menu is not 500 items long but has a good variety between more raw/sushi like items and hot dishes.  We tried both buns and they were outstanding.  The Katsu bun is slightly better than the Moto in terms of unique flavors but both were very well executed (and a little messy). The waitress told us that the buns are messy and that they do not give out cutlery so you should order two. It's OK, we shared and it wasn't the worst thing in the world.  The Sushi Aburi was excellent and fun to have a deconstructed roll and then you roll yourself.  The Dyno wings were so good we had to order more.  We were skeptical on the concept.  On the one hand I love chicken wings and I love pork dumplings.  But together? There is no middle ground, its either amazing or heresy.  Luckily, it was amazing.  The drinks are also as complex as most of the dishes.  The miso ice cream is a must.  We shared it amongst the two of us and it came with tiny spoons so you could keep savoring it over and over again.  The ice cream was definitely made with condensed milk and had a more kulfi like consistency to it.  The little crunch on top left me with a nostalgic feeling, but to what I wasn't sure.  Decor: It's like walking into what a late night at a 40s style diner is like when its past closure and all the employees are just enjoying their own meal.  The seating is all over the place but it has a cool fun vibe to it.  It's certainly a good talking point.  It was oddly hard to find the location as there is no sign outside and if I didn't notice people outside smoking I wouldn't know where this place is. Service: The waitress we had was fine but we were happily eating our food and they just coming and taking away our plates.  I was still eating some of that garnish that fell on the plate.  It was pretty annoying.  Like no I was not done picking at my food, let me enjoy every morsel please. Price: Overall for quality and interest, pretty darn good.Notable Extras: I think the Dyno wings and decor really suit the place.  It's really is a place that the flavor profiles, decor and ambiance just all marry well together.

Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse,"Finally got to try this place when I took my girlfriend here for her birthday. First off, the exterior is very nondescript, and with the snow starting to pile up, it was bit harder than expected to find. Once inside though, the decor was modern and nice.It being my first time here, and knowing the cost, I was expecting a more intimate, fine dining experience, but that was definitely not the case. There were several tables of business professionals, some actually just having a meeting over dinner. The atmosphere was much louder than I expected, especially with a very obnoxious table behind us. I could barely hear my girlfriend across the table while speaking normally. Another table beside us made a comment to a manager but nothing was done as far as I could tell. This was a bit of a bummer, but got better when they quieted down to eat.Onto the food, we ordered the Caesar salad, a side of Potatoes, half-order of mushrooms and for the meats, a 60-day aged 18 oz PEI bone-in striploin and a 4 oz cut of A5 Black Tajima-Hokkaido striploin. This was plenty for the two of us. The PEI striploin was great, and the A5 AMAZING. I wish I could have afforded more. The bread they give in the beginning was really good.The sides were just alright; the fries nothing particularly special. The Caesar salad prepared table side was fun, and tasty.It was for a birthday, so in the end they brought out a candle-lit plate with 2 pieces of chocolate, which was nice. And there are the muffins that came with the bill.Altogether the bill was around $385, which was quite steep (for me). The service was friendly and attentive, and our waiter explained a bit about the meats and the aging process in the beginning. The food was good: some things amazing, some just okay.

I ordered their famous Caesar Salad which was prepared tableside and a 12 oz ribeye aged 30 days medium rare from Van Groningen Farm with a side of duck fat fries.The Caesar Salad ($19 plus tax) prepared tableside in a large wooden bowl was fantastic, traditionally done with egg yolk, bacon, tabasco sauce, worcestershire sauce, romaine lettuce, croutons and grated parmesan cheese.

Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse,"This is one of my favourite places for steak in Toronto. I've had a couple of different steaks from here, and they've been really great. Except the 60 days aged steak that one waiter recommended, which was tough and I didn't enjoy it. What a waste! Anyway, my two favourite cuts were the Japanese Wagyu ($200 for 6 oz) and the deceptively small US Wagyu ($130 for 6 oz) but very filling. If I had to choose between the two salads, I prefer the lobster salad more only because I love lobster. However, the Caesar Salad is definitely a staple starter and big enough to share. Been here for different occasions (anniversaries, casual dinner and business), and service has been pretty consistent. Seriously debating whether to try their Kobe beef on our upcoming dinner. Or just wait until 2018 ... cause we'll be in Kobe again for sure. I'll probably wait cause spending $200 for a 4 oz steak (and no meat sweat) doesn't seem that appealing.",4.0,5.0,447,2017-07-20,43.645371,-79.398011,Steakhouses
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse,"If fancy restaurants aren't part of your daily life, entering Jacob's & Co. Steakhouse will feel like you've won the lottery (only instead, you'll end up paying a generous bill later on). The decor gives this restaurant the quirk and character which I really loved.But enough about the decor, let's talk about the food.To start, we were brought bread in the shape of muffins. Let me tell you, this is probably one of the best breads I've ever had. EVER. The bread itself is perfectly crunchy on the outside and hollow on the inside, but is the perfect container for all that steam that just puffs out when you tear it open.I had the 8oz Michima Reserve Wagyu tenderloin and I have to say, it's pretty close to the Akita beef I had in Japan months ago. Very soft, tender, and well seasoned.And the fries.... duck fat fries to be specific, were amazing too.I can't say enough amazing things about this place. If you're looking for a fancy place to treat yourself or your significant other, I HIGHLY recommend this place.",4.0,5.0,447,2017-08-14,43.645371,-79.398011,Steakhouses
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse,"The famous Jacobs! It was good but be prepared to splurge. Complimentary cheese popovers (5/5) - my favorite part of the meal. Fresh & hot, the outside is a little hard but the middle is soft bread. Caesar Salad ($19 +$3 for 2 pieces of anchovies) (4/5) - this was good, I liked the anchovies and the spicy kick from the Tabasco. Big chunks of real bacon. Prepared table side, but I felt it was redundant because there was no introduction or interaction between us and the server. I noticed this was not the case with other tables though. Beef Tartare (2/5) - possibly the least appetizing presentation of beef tartare I've had. The toasts were super hard. I found the meat paired better with the lettuce - this was easier to eat and brought out the beef flavor more, though I couldn't taste the truffle oil.Creamed Spinach (3/5) - I like how you can order half portion for the sides. Pretty good - the spinach is more on the raw side vs. very cooked & creamy. Red Top Farms Wagyu - MO, USA - Bone in Striploin 18oz ($270) (4/5) - no doubt the meat is flavourful and soft, but it was too salty for my taste.  They provide a side of 3 salts & 3 sauces - I liked the chimichurri sauce the most. Good for sharing between 2 people. Complimentary whisky-filled chocolates & take-home chocolate chip muffins was a nice touch.The dining room was a bit loud, definitely upscale vibe.",4.0,4.0,447,2017-10-24,43.645371,-79.398011,Steakhouses

Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse,"Came here for my brother's birthday awhile back, and it was such a nice experience. From outside, it's hard to tell how huge this place actually is on the inside. We went on an adventure with the hostess to a dining area downstairs, and were promptly visited by the waiter to discuss the best way to order. We got three different cuts of steak, the potato gratin, potato puree, and the Caesar salad, made tableside. They give you these huge popovers to start, and they are so delicious and warm. The salad, although very cool to see made for you, was very disappointing. I found it very salty, and nothing to brag about. The cuts of steak were like butter to eat, however I was not feeling well after eating it the next few days, as maybe my body did not react well to the type. The potato dishes were scrumptious and went perfect with our meat. We finished with their chocolates and muffins to take home. Although my body had a bad reaction, I think I'd still go back and maybe not eat as much beef. The service was absolutely stellar and it felt nice to be waited on by multiple servers. This place is definitely not cheap, but you are paying for the quality of food and great service.",4.0,4.0,447,2017-11-28,43.645371,-79.398011,Steakhouses
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse,"It's a little hard to review this place because it's so damn expensive...  actually they have some dry-aged local steaks that aren't that expensive.  But I'm not sure if anyone actually order them, I could be wrong.Little basic info, all steaks have to be aged.  Either wet or dry aged.  The steak you get at your local supermarket are most likely wet aged which basically means when the cow is slaughtered, the meat is packed in vacuum packing and the time between packing and cooking is the wet aging time.  Dry aging basically takes that further in a dry and controlled environment and the time is usually a lot longer.So what's the difference?  I find the steaks at Jacob's to be more tender than the counterpart of the same cut.  Also I think it's more tasteful too but that's subjective because dry-aged steaks have that (cheese)(preserved) feel to the taste, can't find an adjective for that.  Wet aged steaks well taste more meaty, more fresh meat feel.  If you understand what I'm trying to describe, good for you.It's definitely a very high end restaurant so only come here for special occasions.  We didn't get the most expensive A5 Kobe Beef, my wife and I got the Wagyu from USA and Australia.  Both were delicious, not so much anymore with the $600 bill at the end lol.  Oh ya I forgot to mention the fancy Caesar salad that they make in front of you, there is definitely a position in the restaurant which the job is only to make Caesar salads.They really cook to perfection in terms of doneness whereas at The Keg, it's a hit or miss.  Not a fair comparison but it's a good reference.Ok in summary, if you can afford it, give it a try and you'll discover another world of steak other than The Keg, you truly do taste the difference,  but of course not $500 difference.I would definitely go again,  it's something you gotta save up for.

Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse,"I love coming here - it's my favourite steakhouse! My most recent visit was the other night with 6 other friends. As usual, Jacobs was busy and there wasn't an empty table in sight. Reservations are highly recommended - regardless of whether it's for two people or a group since people love dining here. Reservations can be booked through the OpenTable website but any group larger than 4 requires a call to the restaurant. In our case, I booked a few weeks ago for our group dinner the other night.Their complimentary homemade bread (popovers) with the herb butter is a great start to the meal here. They're soft on the outside and airy on the inside. So good!There are many appetizers and sides to choose from such as their famous ceasar salad that's made table side (never ordered this because salad is salad to me lol but apparently it's good), oysters rockefeller, potato gratin, mushrooms, etc for under $20. We love the duck fat frites here so I'd recommend getting that.They have a great selection of high quality steaks from around Canada, U.S., Japan to name a few. You can get a delicious one for under $80 and of course, there are higher end steaks for those willing to spend. I got an 8 oz tenderloin from PEI and my husband got a 12 oz corn fed striploin from Kansas on this particular occasion. I like my steak well done and it's always flavourful, melts in my mouth and never dry or chewy here. Mmm! Everyone loved their steaks and all were done to their liking.I never get around to dessert here since I'm always too full after having steak but they have many good choices for under $15. They also give complimentary chocolate chip muffins when it's time to go, which is a nice touch.Service here is amazing - from hostesses upon entering, actual servers at the table, staff walking you to the washroom if you're not sure where to go, etc. They also aren't snobby and pretentious from my experiences here - professional but friendly people. Always a fantastic experience here - that's why we and so many others keep coming back! Keep it up Jacobs & Co!!!",4.0,5.0,447,2017-05-14,43.645371,-79.398011,Steakhouses

Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse,"Two weeks prior to visiting Toronto I made reservations to Jacobs. There was so much hype about this establishment that I wanted to make this experience my last before my flight back to Miami. The second we walked through the doors we were immediately greeted and thanked for coming. The host sat us upstairs right in front of the dry-aged meet locker. The downstairs seating was very nice as well and they had a lovely piano and bar, however I was happy with our table on the second floor. We started with the table-side caesar which is 100% a must order. Watching them make a perfect caesar salad with parmesan, croutons and french style added bacon made my mouth water.  We ended up ordering the 60 day aged USDA T- Bone with Bone Marrow and the A5 Kobe Black Tajima-Hyogo Prefecture, Japan cut (California Cut Striploin). For the  sides we ordered the mushrooms, potato gratin, and the obvious foie gras! The Potato gratin reminded me of the same that my mother would make me growing up.

This restaurant is spacious. There's a lower dining section with a bar and an upper main dining room. You also have the option to check in your coat at the  reception. They start you off with their bacon salad. The bacon is just so crunchy and delicious, has a different taste to it that differs than the  way American restaurants prepares their salad. The seafood tower was also spectacular. Ranges from lobster, crabs, jumbo shrimp and different types of clams. Finally for our main course we had New York and Black angus, the steak was very tender and delicious.

In reality, what I got was an overwhelming amount of fat that just clogged up my arteries and left my mouth with a really disgusting aftertaste. I could not eat more than 2-3 slices.

Definitely use a fork & knife for this and don't forget to add their homemade hot sauces for that extra kick.  The huaraches was more of a snack and not for someone looking for a big meal.

I don't consider myself to be well-versed in genuine Mexican food, but the tortilla had a very strong floral corn aroma that overpowered the taste of the meat and condiments. The filling itself was a little bland, lacking in seasoning and salt.  The floral flavour in particular took away from the tacos. The only one that I can say I really enjoyed was the Pastor, as it had some enjoyable seasoning to the meat.  Next time I might try the burrito instead.  In all fairness, my friend that I was dining with claimed to thoroughly enjoy his meal.  Perhaps I caught them on an off-day, or maybe my sensibilities and tastes just don't coincide with authentic Mexican cuisine.",4.0,3.0,32,2017-07-10,43.667785,-79.369729,Mexican

The currants and pine nuts really work in this dish. Just a hint of sweetness amidst the tartness of the lemon vinaigrette. Really good! Had to have some of their red sangria, too. Perfect summer drink. The first time I came here, I wasn't overly impressed with the service, but it's definitely improved since then. Also, their house bread is fantastic. Fresh from their oven, it's definitely worth getting a basket for the table. I don't think they used to charge for the bread, but they do now. In any case, if you like bread, get it!

Trattoria Nervosa,"This place lived up to the high expectations I had after hearing a friend of mine rave about it. She's been many times and this was a first time for me. I was a bit concerned that it might not be worth the prices they charge like other restaurants in Yorkville but I have to say, I can't think of a single real thing wrong with the whole experience. I ordered the mafalde ai funghi that my friend had been going on about and told me I had to try. She was right. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the sauce was rich and creamy with lots of mushrooms. When it got to the table, the scent of truffles was overwhelming in a good way. Really a spot on dish that I would highly recommend to have here. Although I could have eaten an entire pot of this stuff, the portion was just about right, not so much as to make you feel bloated afterwards. The drinks are quite pricey but hey, it's Yorkville and the ingredients in their cocktails do seem to be of good quality (nice fresh herbs and garnishes etc).We got there around 8 pm on saturday and were nervous we wouldn't get a table but it was only about a 10 minute wait and the line was moving quite quickly. The waiter was super friendly and although we sat outside, it was a nice night out. Didn't see much of the interior but it looks quite nice from what I saw. I would definitely come back here to try more dishes. To put it over the edge, upon going to their instagram page, I found out that a dollar from every mafalde and kale salad goes to hurricane relief effort which I think is cool of them. Glad I supported that (even if it was unknowingly lol).",3.0,5.0,253,2017-10-23,43.67102,-79.391085,"Italian , Pizza , Salad"
Trattoria Nervosa,Sitting here right now having the beef carpaccio. Fantastic. And I don't remember the name but it is a sort of mushroom truffle pasta.

Trattoria Nervosa,Came here for a dinner a few weeks ago.  Located in Yorkville this TINY restaurant definitely caters to the crowd.We ordered a few dishes to share - the Polipo dish - grilled octopus ($18).  I was DELICIOUS.  Tender and not overly salty - melt in your mouth.  This restaurant tends to get packed - it's loud and a bit claustrophobic.  It gets annoying that you constantly have to scoot your chair in to let people pass or be careful about not hitting your neighbor or try to eat on tiny tables.  That is my one overall annoyance about any restaurant.The service was nice and it does have that fun/loud vibe - definitely not for a intimate dinner - you can't hear the person across from you.  If that's the vibe you are going for then don't come here.,3.0,3.0,253,2017-09-12,43.67102,-79.391085,"Italian , Pizza , Salad"
Trattoria Nervosa,"Trattoria Nervosa is located in the heart of Yorkville and serves delicious Italian food. I've been to their sister restaurant, Gusto 101, plenty of times but only recently tried Nervosa for the first time. Both Nervosa and Gusto have almost identical menus but there are some differences (in terms of food and in price). Due to the location and probably the customers the Yorkville area attracts, the food is slightly more expensive at Nervosa (even when comparing the same dish that is found at both Nervosa and Gusto). Nonetheless, great Italian food in the city.My boyfriend and I arrived at Trattoria Nervosa on a Saturday night at around 6:30pm. We expected there to be a line and probably waited about 15 minutes before we got a table. Once seated we were given water and given ample time to decide what we wanted to eat. My boyfriend selected an Italian beer while I opted for a pinot grigio. To start we ordered a tagliere misto (cured meat board) to share. It came with a selection of 4 cured meats, pickled vegetables, crostini, and mustard. Great sharing board to share, very light and refreshing. For the mains we both ordered the infamous mafalde ai funghi. Can never get sick of this pasta dish. I don't even enjoy eating mushrooms but I'll eat this pasta any day. We both didn't get dessert as we wanted to eat elsewhere afterwards. Overall, great friendly service, amazing food (as always), and comforting atmosphere.",3.0,4.0,253,2017-05-01,43.67102,-79.391085,"Italian , Pizza , Salad"
Trattoria Nervosa,"This is such an amazing small Italian restaurant that I can't believe it took me this long to discover it. Located in Yorkville, there are sufficient parking spots conveniently located close to the restaurant.Restaurant has two floors. We walked in on a Friday night at 9pm. A group of 3 still took us 15-20mins of a wait time. Book a reservation to avoid wait time. I did get a little bit impatient but the wait is wellllll worth it. Also, a group of 3 is always harder to get a table i guess...*** Mafalde ai Funghi *** this is the hands down DA BEST mushroom pasta I have everrrr had. Mushrooms included: portobello, porcini, crimini, oyster mushroomsLight cream sauce with parmigiano topped with some truffle paste$19First bite already got me!! Because it is so creamy, so rich, SO GOOD that I want to lick the plate. Portion is good too! You might think how special a mushroom pasta can be but I want to convince you that, the easiest food item def takes the most skills to deliver a rich flavored satisfying dish.I ordered a coffee to end the dinner as I got so full from the pasta. The coffee also wow-ed me! Rich dark coffee with some amazing aroma. Also, the cream WAS HEATED WARM for us, so thoughtful!! Love it!!Last piece of advice, avoid sitting on the 2nd floor. The servers keep running up and down to deliver food from kitchen downstairs to the upper floor. I just personally would like to avoid my food being travelled like that if you know what I mean... hygiene reasons.",3.0,5.0,253,2017-03-19,43.67102,-79.391085,"Italian , Pizza , Salad"
Trattoria Nervosa,"Visited with a group of co-workers before an event in Yorkville.Overall, I enjoyed my experience. We were hoping to sit out on the patio (it was really nice out!) but there wasn't room for our group of 5 people so we were seated inside upstairs. Side note, the stairs on the way up to the second level are super tight and probably slightly hard to navigate after having a couple of drinks and/or wearing high heels.We ordered bread for the table (delicious!) along with a pitcher of red sangria (delightful!) and the mushroom bruschetta (very yummy!). For my main, I opted for the Calamarata con Gamberi - which was house made short pasta with wild shrimp, tomato sauce, cherry tomato, chilies, marjoram, parsley. Super tasty and I finished my whole plate!! Loved the tender shrimp plus the spicy tomato sauce, so good!We were too stuffed to try dessert but I will have to come back next time to try!",3.0,4.0,253,2017-08-17,43.67102,-79.391085,"Italian , Pizza , Salad"
Trattoria Nervosa,"Came here on Monday for an early dinner, and I was really excited to try the ""Polipo"" dish - grilled octopus, lemon potatoes, chimichurri, tapenade, piquillo puree, arugula, fried capers for $17.99. We got there for 5:15pm and there were already quite a few people in the dining room. We were seated promptly and it took about 10 minutes to have someone come over to greet us. We stuck with water and ordered immediately. Once we ordered a waiter came by and practically dropped two plates on our table. He did not say anything, just dropped the plates and walked away. About 10 minutes after that we got our food (my guest ordered the Capellini and she noted how happy she was that the portion was small. Let's just say that she is in the minority re: liking small portions). Once during dinner we were asked how we were enjoying our meal.In all honesty, I felt terrible for the staff - they looked miserable and not happy to be there. Throughout the entire dinner they were huddled in a corner by the kitchen and every once in a while they would separate to quickly check on their patrons and then quickly returned to the corner. In situations like that you end up feeling like a burden, rather than a guest. In sum: The food was delicious, and the ambiance had potential. But the service was lacking and too cold for my liking. Such a shame considering that such great food could be overshadowed by lukewarm service. P.S. Apparently Gusto101 has the same menu - so I suggest you go there instead - I hear they put great emphasis on offering good service.",3.0,3.0,253,2016-12-14,43.67102,-79.391085,"Italian , Pizza , Salad"
Trattoria Nervosa,"Cute, perfect for lunch, Italian space in Yorkville. My coworker and I went on a Friday afternoon for lunch. We shared a zesty kale salad to start with a glass of red each. I could not get over how adorable and cozy the restaurant cafe was! It felt like I was in a little village in Europe (even though I've never been to Europe)!I got a butternut squash dish, which was incredibly delectable, with just the right amount of buttery goodness and seasoning. The butternut squash ravioli dish came in about 8 pieces with sage and pine nuts as garnish. So so so good. My coworker had their tomato base sauce spaghetti with goat cheese. She loved hers too. We did sneak a second glass of wine too, we didn't want to leave just yet!The bill came to about $106, so about $65 each person.

I saw photos of the Capellini (and the heaping mound of goat cheese) and was sold. It's a rich, hearty tomato sauce and the goat cheese is creamy and fantastic. The dish packs a punch and it's now my new favourite thing. Servers are super friendly - refilling water glasses, answering questions. We never felt rushed at any point. Alright.

Decor is trendy and lighting creates great ambiance.  We were seated and our water girl filled our glasses.  They have a cocktail cart going around the restaurant. The server explained how it worked as well as suggesting signature dishes. Two of four people were returning so explained and filled in the gaps of what was not known. We took the suggestion as the food was for sharing and each picked a menu item. We ordered:Their signature coleslawCheese burger spring rollsLobster ravioliSambal satay Also each ordered drinks. Their oyster Cesar was very good. All the drinks were mixed well. Good bartender for once who actually took the time to prepare a drink. But then again at $18 a Cesar, you prob should expect the best :)The coleslaw comes with a show when they mix it all together! She explains the ingredients as she mixes which is an experience in itself!The cheese burger spring rolls were delicious and the sambal satay was filled with skewered chicken beef and shrimp cooked to perfection with the perfect pairing of sauces. I will say that the food was delicious, I liked the glass windows which gave it a nice warm feel having visited on a cold January day! Some bad things, the water girl had bad BO. Someone fix that issue! For the price I wish I knew the size of dishes as although filling I found some dishes light in portion size for sharing in a group.

We tried so many dishes and we liked almost everything (just the curry chicken wasn't very exciting i thought). As expected and remembered the food was fantastic. So many flavors in every dish. For such a high end restaurant i think the portions were very generous too. Lee is a type of restaurant that not only you get a one of a kind culinary experience, you won't walk out planning your burger stop on the way home. The service was also great and our waiter was super nice and attentive. We were a party of four and we were sharing all the dishes so when we got the two way tuna (which normally comes with two tacos) they gave us two extras so we all could taste the dish.

Lee Restaurant,"I definitely have mixed feelings about Lee! We came to eat as a group of 6 last Thursday, when friends were visiting from out of town. Here's the deal:The pros:-Friendly service and good explanation of dishes on the menu-Very accommodating - we did a $65 chefs choice menu and they accommodated peanut allergies and vegetarians (vegetarian actually got her own individual servings of veg dishes when the course brought for the table contained meat)-Decent food and interesting dessertThe cons:-The 'scene' - very loud, very hot, and very dark. Hard to have a conversation, especially with someone at the other end of the table. Tables are also really close together where we were sitting so overall felt very uncomfortable.-Very expensive. We left very full but it ended up being way more expensive than I'd anticipated. I'd suggest ordering a la carte, even with the $65 meal (the cheapest option for chefs menu) I think we got too much food. -The food wasn't AS good as I hoped for the price. I'd heard so much about the singapore slaw but feel like I could've made something similar at home. The fried chicken was good but a little dry and could have been hotter.Overall we had an okay time but I don't think I'll be going back.",4.0,2.0,496,2017-12-02,43.644144,-79.400384,Asian Fusion
Lee Restaurant,"Great place for a girls night! I'm a bit cautious with Asian fusion places because most times it tastes just like regular chinese food with a higher price tag. We had:Cheese burger spring rolls - this comes over a lettuce leaf which you wrap around the spring roll and eat. This was really rich and crispy. I loved the lettuce used because it added a freshness you needed to counterbalance the rich spring roll. This was overall, great!Singapore slaw - always worth while! 19 ingredients all finely chopped with some dressing, I could have just eaten that. Amazing.Slow Braised Beef - this was good. Not blown away, but good. Meat was soft, flavours went well together but all in all, just ok.Peking & Char Sui Duck Breast & ""LUCKEE"" SHRIMP CHEUNG FUN - okay...here's where I took some issue with the cost vs. what you're getting. Note I am not a food connoisseur by any means, just someone who loves food. I found this was comparable to getting peking duck and cheung fun at any Chinese restaurant, just fancier. Clearly there were more ingredients and there were bigger chunks of duck and shrimp but flavour-wise, very similar. Service - very friendly staff and great serviceAtmosphere - loved this! Kind of classy/tacky but it works. Music was so loud I never hear much of what the staff said about the dishes they brought out. Why I gave 3/5 when it sounds like it was so great? It was!

Lee Restaurant,"4/5 Disclaimer: Mainly based off the Summerlicious dinner menuCame with two friends on a Monday night. Had a 7pm reservation (easy - done online!) and was seated promptly. Ended up ordering 2 summerlicious sets along with the famous slaw to share. Apps (Cod & Octopus Taco // Cheeseburger Spring Roll): Taco was nice and crunchy, tasted more of the mango and papaya compared to the ""main"". The cheese was a bit strong in the spring roll, although overall it had a nice chili taste. Entree (Roasted Grouper // Pulled Beef Purse): Grouper was cooked well, but expected more flavor. The plantain and vegetables were a good mix along with the grouper. The pulled beef was very hearty and filling, especially being wrapped around the confit crepe. Dessert (Chocolate Pudding // Passionfruit ice cream // Coconut Tapioca Cake): This actually made sense as a trio, as I found two of the items to be a stronger taste (Chocolate & Passionfruit). Fav was the coconut cake as I prefer a lighter taste. SLAW: Definitely the highlight of my experience. If there was one thing I remembered, its that there are 19 ingredients in this dish! The crunch of the sesame and peanuts blended nicely with all the vegetables, along with a light dressing. Service was attentive and friendly throughout. Our server recommended not getting a Summerlicious set for each person and good thing we listened because we were stuffed afterwards. The summerlicious combination was nice but I think I would prefer to try more of the signature dishes in the future (such as the cheung fan).",4.0,4.0,496,2017-07-25,43.644144,-79.400384,Asian Fusion

I'm usually not a salad person, but this slaw was really flavourful and crunchy, with a refreshing mixture of different vegetables and a light peanut and roasted sesame dressing. I would come back just for this dish. The Summerlicious dishes were not as impressive, although I did really enjoy the Cod & Octopus Taco, which was crunchy and fresh, with the mango and papaya nicely complementing the seafood. The Cheese Burger Spring Roll was not as special, with an overwhelming cheese taste that made it seem a little heavy.  The Roasted Grouper was flavourful but light, paired nicely with squash and plantains. The dessert trio contained items that are not on the regular menu. The only one worth mentioning was the passionfruit ice cream with basil seeds, which was the perfect balance of sweet and tangy. The highlight for me was actually their sangria, which contains 27 ingredients with a base of lychee rose and prosecco. They actually push around a sangria cart and make it right in front of you.

Lee Restaurant,"Made reservations for Saturday night around 2 weeks in advance and managed to land a 5:45pm dinner slot. It was pretty busy for being this early, but expected for a swanky upscale restaurant. I had pretty high expectations for the restaurant ... and was a little bit underwhelmed to be honest. Service was awesome and our main waiter was fairly attentive. But the food however... fell a little bit flat for me. Slaw salad - this was probably the best-tasting part of the meal! For $25, it's got a pretty hefty price tag, but I had shared this with one other person and I was already halfway full once we finished it. Would I get it again? Maybe. But with the price tag, I felt like I could've gotten something similar for cheaper at another restaurant. It had flower petals though. It's pretty. Chicken Curry - heard gud stuff about this... not my favourite dish. The chicken was VERY tender and the skin was pretty crispy (almost felt like peking duck), but it was kind of bland and the sauces weren't really working out for me. Was not really a fan of any of them. The dish was pretty though. Peking Duck - Asian fusion things, so they had foie gras, marmalade, and things. S'ok. I wish they brought this out before the chicken curry because I was pretty stuffed after the chicken and couldn't really enjoy it, this is my fault. Overall, it was pretty good - but the sauces were a miss for me. This was a pretty dish though. Overall - 3.5/5 Maybe my expectations were too high and I'm not used to the good life. Would come back for salad to share though :D",4.0,3.0,496,2017-09-30,43.644144,-79.400384,Asian Fusion
Lee Restaurant,"W O WI was never a fan of Asian Fusion - or fusion anything. Lee, with a 4 star rating on Yelp and serving Fusion Cuisine, did not convince me enough to go in the past. But everything changed on a late Sunday night when I was starving and most restaurants in downtown were either closed, or required reservation. Lee was open, I called and the lady on the other side of the phone informed me that no reservation was required at that time.After arriving at Lee, we realized how underdressed we were. Despite the jeans, track pants, and t-shirts, we were still warmly greated by everyone at the restaurant. Our server was so patient and friendly, even though we just wanted to order ASAP and eat. We ordered the Rack of Lamb Thailandaise, Top Chef Curry Roasted Chicken, and the Signature Singaporean Style Slaw. I wanted to add tuna to the Slaw but our server assured us that the chicken and lamb was enough protein. The wait for the food was reasonable since the place was fairly full with couple large parties around us. The Slaw was first served with the server mixing it up for us. Wasn't expecting much even though they emphasized the word ""signature"" quite a bit, I was COMPLETELY mind blown by how much I loved it. I would probably like it much more with some protein in, but I had to agree with our server about the other dishes. The Lamb was amazing too...definitely surprised me with the mintiness of the lentil sauce, but it was unique. And onto the award winning chicken, which deserves a paragraph all to itself. Huge pieces of chicken (not talking about small nugget size), with curry that was not overpowering the taste of chicken, had a lovely sweet touch of pineapples decorated on the side, I don't know how much better the dish can get. The highlight of the dish is the tenderness of the chicken. I never thought it would be possible for such large chunks of chicken to be so tender, it was almost melting in my mouth.Last but not least we finished our amazing dining experience with Signature French & Chinese Tong Yuen. I have to admit there was a bit too much going on with this dessert, but every single bite was something interesting and unique. I drank quite a bit of water that night and my glass was never empty for more than a minute or two. Service here alone deserves an award.Lee has changed my perspective on Asian Fusion. It's a place I will take friends and family who are visiting from outside of Toronto, as it so perfectly presents the Asian multi-culturalism. I will definitely be back.",4.0,5.0,496,2017-04-04,43.644144,-79.400384,Asian Fusion
416 Snack Bar,"I like this place. Can't wait to go again. I went here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon, but I've passed by on weekend nights and it appears jam packed!The atmosphere is relaxed and trendy industrial / wood decor. Small place. There was a long list of drinks but did not have any this time for lunch. I would try this again for evening drinks and snacks. So this review is based mostly on the food. Tapas like style, No utensils. The dishes that came out were delicious! A mix of flavors that blend well together and textures - Octo Bravas was what was recommended and it did not disappoint - the most tender octopus I have had and flavorful. The mushroom tuna hand roll was yummy as well, Argentinian beef was very tender and the scotch egg benny was tasty (though a bit to rich for me but my bf said it was his fav). The Korean fried chicken was good though for me, it was nothing outstanding.

We got Octo Bravas-which i generally like octopus and squid very much-, falafal double down, not bad . Pakoras , pretty good. & we tried the special thing which was an empinada, loved it .

416 Snack Bar,"This place has been on my hit list for a couples years now. My partner and I went at close to midnight (Sunday night) after the Nas and Lauren Hill concert and it was still packed even though it was technically a Monday now. Thankfully the kitchen was open. We had to wait 5-10 mins to be seated. Expect to sit closely next to others on a table of 6 unless you're okay with the bar seats. They really just have a couple tables for two people.The ambiance is nice. Great hip hop music with candles on the table. The service was excellent! We got wet clothes to clean our hands with.Many of the items on the menu were sold out for the night. And there are only a limited number of vegetarian options on this menus.I kept hearing about the Korean Chicken. Although I didn't try it (partner did) I tried the sauce which wasn't great at all - what's everyone raving about ? My partner said it wasn't great.... I believe him. * falafel double down: was tasty and  had a hot spicy kick but not enough spice. * the eggplant sangwich double down was hot (temperature wise), the bun was delicious with filling and the inside was meh. Recommendation: maybe they can have the eggplant sangwich double down bun with the falafel double down inside-ingredients. That might bring the emerged product back to life.Bathrooms were out of toilet paper and the ceiling had a crack in it.

416 Snack Bar,"It was really loud inside the restaurant, mainly from the cluster of customers inside the small restaurant.  I found it difficult to hear even my friend who was sitting right next to me.  This is not a good place for a date because you'll probably end up shouting at each other and/or start nodding and pretending you understand what the other person is saying after a few times of ""What?  What did you say?"" in order to keep the conversation going.  It's a good spot for a casual hang-out though.Their menu changes every so often and the selection is rather small (which made it easy on the kitchen to serve up all of the food very quickly).  There were no utensils on the table.  Everything was meant to be eaten with hands or the wooden picks which were provided.We ended up getting most of the 'mains' to try but still shared almost everything.The Foie Gras Torchon with Toasts was probably the best item all night!  This was a cylinder-shaped glob of foie gras served with applesauce and toasts.  The foie gras was incredibly smooth and so delicious!  I couldn't believe how good this was.I was looking forward to the Korean Fried Chicken after seeing it on a photo on Instagram.  It definitely looked great and smelled tarty from the spices.  The chicken bites were more tough than I would have liked.I ordered the Eggplant Sangwich Doubledown.  This was a sandwich made with eggplants as the bread with cheese between it.  It was okay.  The eggplant didn't actually taste like eggplant as there were some quinoa infused into it.  The cheese was very gooey and chewy.  I think I left this on the table for too long that when I ate it, it was already a bit cold and wasn't optimal.I enjoyed the Lamb Kofta too.  There were two skewers of this so we split it up between the three of us.  The sauce was quite good too.The Steak Tartare was unexpectedly served on two toasts a la bruschetta style.  This made it difficult to share between three people.  I thought that the steak tartare was okay.  Pairing it with the bread made the taste of the raw beef stand out less.Lastly, we shared the Black Cod Onigiri.  This was perfect for sharing for the three of us.  It was adorable too!  The black cod was backpacked on to a piece of rice with seaweed like sushi!  This was really good too although it was definitely small in size.The service here was excellent as our server was attentive and made sure our water glasses were full.  He also make sure to clear any empty dishes promptly too.All in all, I thought that 416 Snack Bar was very expensive for what it offered (I split around $20 for my bill) and I didn't leave with a full stomach.  I'm happy I finally got to try it but I don't see a need to return for another visit at all.",4.0,3.0,267,2017-10-18,43.64755,-79.403865,"Tapas/Small Plates , Bars"
416 Snack Bar,"Not a big menu, but offers a different style of food. Small tapas and plates that sounded fusion and interesting. Two of us tried a whole bunch of dishes out, each one having to wait a long while for, but were a bit disappointed when each came out in a minuscule amount. I get that they are tapas, but at a price of $7-10 before tax, each of us needed to probably order 5 in order to get full and that would get expensive real quick.The stuffed chicken was very mediocre although server made it seem delicious. Came out a bit cold and was literally done in one bite. The smallest chicken legs I've seen. Watermelon with feta was so tiny, literally four small slices of watermelon the size of your thumb and I was barely able to taste it to determine whether I liked it or not, before the dish disappeared. Foie and tartere my friend said tasted ok but was also tiny. The mexican corn were two halves and was quite good, similar to La Carnitas street corn. Handroll sushi was the smallest hand roll i've seen at $7 for just one.A dark and cool atmosphere, but the high stools were uncomfortable to sit on.

Looks like the Yelp reviews I read forgot to mention one little detail: at a certain hour, this fine food establishment basically transforms into a club like atmosphere. Nothing wrong with that. Music so loud that you can't hear yourself think and darkness only broken by a few candle sticks, I guess maybe a little warning would have been nice.

416 Snack Bar,"An intimate footprint with an interesting mix of tapas style servings with drinks to be drank... 416 is the place.  Off Queen W near the north west corner of Bathurst, this place is just the spot to take a rest, have a beverage and get a refresher.  We were three so we had a bit of a mix for our small plate orders.  Korean fried chicken (we literally just came from having it at Chimac too LOL), dim sum, foie gras, and two orders of arancini.  How's that for a mix of things?  The fried chicken is in a bit of a tangy sauce kind of a sweet chili type.  It was good, boneless popcorn type served with two toothpicks which we sort of needed for the other things.  There's no cutlery here except for the spreader that came with the foie gras so we used that to cut the other apps up.  The dim sum were 3 dumpling type stacks with 2 each for a total of 6 which works out to be about 2 bucks a piece.  They were good but dim sum is the kind of thing if you're like me you can eat like 30 of those...The foie gras was served with a side of sauce and a good number of crostini slivers for spreading.  It was also good and I that spreading knife came in handy.  The arancini which were not on the menu (special) were also great.  Not as good as say what Libretto makes but better than decent.Overall the food here is small because it's a SNACK bar right?  There's a good mix of things to eat with your drinks but don't come here looking for dinner unless you want to order a bunch of things and get full that way.  Of all the things we had here I think I liked them all equally and I can't say anything was amazingly great but all were better than just ok.  Have a drink, have a seat, take a load off and have something small on the side.  Have a snack in 416 as they do that!",4.0,4.0,267,2017-07-13,43.64755,-79.403865,"Tapas/Small Plates , Bars"

416 Snack Bar,"Review #400In late 2011, following a local Yelp event, a few of us followed then Toronto CM Vivek to a new spot that had opened up on the corner of Bathurst and Queen. By that point, about a year had passed since I had swapped NYC from Toronto and everyone who had crossed me was sick of my comparisons between the food scenes in the two cities. Snack Bar quickly became the first spot in Toronto which turned the tables and had me bragging to my friends from New York. Between the passionate staff, slick layout, and crisp old school hip hop playing in the background this place definitely had a personality of its own.  Add to that a display over the bar where the rotating artwork included painting of the Maple Leafs and a panel of old TTC bus transfers and you had a spot that was quintessential Toronto. In the years since, the menu has changed countless times, as have the clientele with the emergence of rave reviews in every local outlet. Despite this, the character of the bar and the drive of the staff to deliver something different appears to be well intact. From some of the more consistent menu items I have always enjoyed the steak tartar, steamed buns and oysters. The menu items I wish would return are many and include the scallops ceviche (pair with tequila), devils on horseback, eggplant parm and anything I've tried with quail eggs! The drinks are also quite potent and well made. My favs here include the corpse reviver #2, paper plane and gimlet. The options for beer, wine and cider are mostly on point, while they also serve a phenomenal chaser with shots of tequila! Add to all of this the fact that they were very accommodating to a friend's extensive food allergies during a visit and you have a place that's a winner on my list. Overall, Snack Bar has managed to remain my favorite place in the city since the first time I stepped in. Their consistency and professionalism deserves praise and should help establish them into a Toronto institution at this rate.

Ordered the caprese salad, the rolled ham and cheese appetizers (forgot what it's called), and 2 pizzas including the marghareta pizza with arugula added and the diavola. AMAZING. highly recommend all. By far the best tasting caprese salad that doesn't shy down on its portions or cheese slices. Fresh and light. The pizzas were done quite quickly maybe about a 10 or so minute wait. Would need a fork and a knife to cut into it because the toppings weigh down the bread a bit. Crust/appetizers/bread is very very good with the hot garlic sauce provided. If I could buy it I would! If you're not a fan of hot it might come off as really spicy. But the flavour is strong and works well with the breads for sure! Bread is fresh, with a perfect crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Price- fairly priced! About $12-25 dishes. Nothing heavy on the pocket. Service & environment- Amazing. Waitress kept checking up on us, let us sit near the tv to watch the Jays game. Made sure our water jug was never empty.

Napoli Centrale,"It was time for Perfect Pizza Quest iteration numero 6.  This is a UYE primarily organized by Namrata of YelpGTA fame.  This night was converged upon by about a dozen willing participants at the area of Bathurst north of Bloor and south of Dupont at Napoli Centrale who on their website claim they are authentic Neopolitan which I'm realizing isn't that unique anymore in TO.  There are quite a few establishments who have this claim (VPN).The dining area is deceivingly spacious and open.  You wouldn't know it by looking at the storefront but the inside is particularly wide and well lit.  The bar is to the right as you enter and the oven and prep area is open concept as well.  If you have a large 800+ degree oven you want to show that baby off am I right?  Some of the countertops around the oven appear to be treated concrete!  How cool is that?  At the table we had 2 by the way, we already had water decanters as well as sliced pizza dough bread with olives and some type of pepper sauce.  The sauce is really tasty, it's as if they are in little baby food jars and I couldn't quite figure out what kind of peppers they used.  The color looked to be Scotch bonnet but they weren't that hot.  I should have asked.  The taste was great though, not too hot at all but tasty enough to dip with the bread AND use when you eat the crust of your pizza.I started off with a salad as did my wife.  I had ordered a Grotto Azzura (Arugula, prosciutto, shaved parmesan, lemon and olive oil dressing) and she had the Mergellina (Mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, shaved carrot, corn, tuna, green olive, mozzarella).  The salads came in full size toss bowls.  They were large, I should have figured that since each was about 12 bucks but I wasn't ready for that size, just a small portion.  I ended up sharing mine out.  Each came with a serving tong.For pizza I had ordered the Diavolo (rossa) as I normally do at these types of places (Smoked provolone, hot soppressata salami) and my wife had ordered a Napoletana (bianche - Sausage, rapini and fior di latte).  I had mine and a slice of hers.  Both were very good.  I enjoy this type of pizza being that it's thin and chewy.  The crust at the edge seems a little thick but it's still good.  I used the hot sauce they provided to eat with the crust which was just great.  The Diavolo had a very nice salty taste to it.  The salami was nice and spicy and the overall flavor was rich with spice and bite to it.  The Napoletana was of course not as spicy since the sausage is much more bland but the rapini is a great combo with any pork in my books.  It was good but having the tongue for spice I have to say I enjoyed mine much more.Over all the service was friendly.  It would have nice to not have to ask for more bread and water though but the service was still good and the food was what you would expect if a place claims to be VPN certified.  I enjoyed it at Napoli Centrale.",4.0,4.0,46,2015-06-05,43.669518,-79.412975,"Italian , Pizza"

It took a while to get our pizzas since we were such a big group. The appetizers came pretty quickly though so we still had quite a bit of food.The pizza was Neapolitan style.

If you are okay with other types of protein, don't bother with the shrimp as I don't think it's crunchy enough, the texture of the shrimp isn't too good. Too soft. Last but not least, the Pad Kaprao Kai Dao. This is rice with mince meat on the side and a sunny side up! Again you can choose minced pork, chicken or beef. The marinade and flavour is very good.

I found their food was a ok, but it's more authentic than commercial Thai restaurants and since there aren't any good Thai restaurants around this neighborhood, I didn't mind paying little extra for better food.However, I recently went there and was shock with their changes. Place was still the same old disorganized small fast pace take out family restaurant with bored and occassionally sassy servers. But they made changes with the menu and now they are charging mediocre beef curry for almost $20. I mean.. do they think they are Pai restaurant? Sure, economy is tough and all but their recent changes just doesn't make any sense to me. There are no change of recipes, no ingredient upgrade, no changes of ambience, no upgraded customer services or change of house system for better service. So I'm not sure what made them think they are $20 price range restaurant but I can confidently say it is not.

EAT BKK Thai Kitchen,"I've had this restaurant bookmarked for quite a while now and we were finally in the neighbourhood and craving Thai food. The parking situation isn't the greatest in the plaza, as it's quite small and there are quite a few other stores using the same lot. The restaurant isn't as small as I thought it would be, but the tables are quite close to each other. All of this is okay considering the location on Yonge street. We ordered the fresh spring rolls, Tom yum soup, chicken Penang (my usual) and the pad kee mao. The soup was quite good. The pad kee mao was quite large and tasted fine, but similarly to my Penang...it was lacking some flavours. I wasn't asked how spicy I wanted my meal to be, even though I noticed later that I had the option to make it spicier...so that was a bit disappointing. Regardless, the curry sauce was quite good. As we finished our meal, I realized that we never received our spring rolls. We received our bill and of course the spring rolls were on it. So, we informed our waiter that we never received them. He had been out of the restaurant I'm not sure how many times, so never really came to check on us or make sure we had everything we had ordered. The waiter quickly returned with a new bill.

Always nice to pre-order your food on your phone on the way there. I usually get the green curry or pad Thai chicken specials but today I decided to try their Basil Pork Belly lunch special and was really disappointed. The pork belly was rock hard and fatty bits were impossible to chew that I had to throw it out and just eat the rice and veggies. And I am the type to clean my plate even when the food isnt that great. The soup and spring rolls were great as usual but it was sad to see them really drop the ball on their pork belly as its one of my favourite proteins to eat. I still plan to go here but not for their pork. I'll be sticking to their chicken dishes from now on. Their regular dinner prices are steep once you add all the extras such as meat.

Eat BKK has a welcoming and decent interior and (very minimal) parking in front.

I came here with friends more recently and while the portions can be enjoyed individually we decided to go family style and shared amongst ourselves. We ordered some of the traditional fare but also tried the satay tacos. Those were okay though it honestly seemed that they just took the regular satay and threw it in a taco shell (which was cold) and some lettuce. You're probably able to just make it yourself at home if you order the satay appetizer haha.

EAT BKK Thai Kitchen,"I liked this place.Fast and convenient, I walked in one day and ordered the pad thai. The restaurant is really cool and trendy looking. It's a small place  but was pretty empty when I walked in. Not sure if it gets busier on the weekends or peak dinner periods. I ordered to-go so I didn't really have a chance to experience the service but the lady taking my order was pretty nice and offered me a seat while I waited for my food.I believe I only waited around 5-10 minutes so that was good. I got the vegetable pad thai and it was pretty good! I kind of likened it to Thai Express, which I know sounds bad but I actually really like that Pad Thai. I must say, the price is almost the same as well. The serving was generous, I definitely could not finish the whole thing, but I didn't find it to be outstanding. It was a bit less sweet than some pad thai dishes I've had in the past and didn't have that weird red colour that most have. The ingredients tasted fresh and there were a lot of vegetables. The reason for 3 stars is that I just didn't find the meal to be all that memorable. I see that they have some interesting fusion dishes like spaghetti and tacos and a night market section on the menu and maybe that's where they excel. It was definitely on par with most Thai restaurants I've had, but I didn't find it to be exceedingly amazing. Maybe my mistake was ordering the most cliche item on the menu, I would definitely come back and try one of the more adventurous dishes next time! Prices are quite reasonable, it's definitely one of the less expensive options in the area and they have a 10% discount if you pay cash.

Just a heads up that the parking lot is also tiny with a handful of spots and a few reserved for the businesses next door. There is street parking available nearby as well. Upon walking in, it's definitely a smaller space with less than a dozen tables so a reservation is definitely recommended to avoid waiting. My friend was easily able to make a reservation on the same day for 6 people around 8 p.m. considering it was a Friday night and constantly busy with people dining or picking up take out orders while we were there. There were several choices on the menu - no shortage of variety here! I ordered the pork belly dish which was recommended by our server. It came with a sunny side up egg, rice and some veggies in a savoury, medium spicy sauce. That sauce definitely made the dish as it would have just been plain pork belly and veggies without it. It was tasty and a good portion for around $12. I also ordered the Thai iced tea for around $3, which was nothing to complain about but I've tasted better elsewhere. My friends ordered the panang curry with beef, pad gra prow and pineapple fried rice - all of which were huge portions in comparison to mine and apparently delicious. All of the dishes were under $14 from what I remember.

It was like speaking to a teenage girl who has better things to do than help my friends and I get some tacos. I had the Baja Fish Tacos, Tuna Belly Tostada, and the Potted Caramel. The Baja Fish Taco was ok. The tortilla was thick with fried fish and cabbage mixture. I had to remove a layer of the tortilla because it overpowered the bland tasting fish and cabbage. The last bite left drips of oil running down my hand, yuck!The Tuna Belly Tostada was the size of an American Half-Dollar. It was heavy on the sauce with no hint of tuna belly with the single bite I had. The star of the night was the Potted Caramel. It was delicious. Get it. There is nothing bad about it.

Grand Electric,"I am writing a second review, not because the food has changed - it is still the same: pretty good, kinda authentic Mexican tacos (but not really) and tasting the same each time , which is a plus (consistency). The reason I lowered yet another star from the already average rating is twofold :1. The staff is overly casual and familiar. That might work for the wannabe hipster crowd that seems to gush over this place, but it is definitely not cool for the 40+ business crowd in dress shirts and suits. I brought a business partner for lunch here and I could see how awkward he felt when the barman and the waitress were taking too familiar liberties in both speech and gesture. After all, his type of crowd dines in places where waiters wear tuxedos. 2. When the patio is closed (8 months of the year ) the place is tiny ! Very few tables and always occupied by hipsters so it is difficult to find space. The one good table is always reserved. The waitress offers the bar but no group would sit on the bar - that's only for when one is alone.",4.0,2.0,593,2018-01-11,43.641675,-79.431608,"Bars , Mexican"

Grand Electric,"I was really looking forward to this place as I've heard great things, but I wasn't totally impressed. Overall this place was good, but not amazing. The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual and relaxed. Tried the chips and dip, shrimp special which came with slaw in a bun, fish tacos and spicy chicken taco. The chips and dip were pretty good. I love that it came with a bunch of different dips and pickled onions, but the salsa was not worth eating. Wish they had given a little more chips as the ratio was a little off. The shrimp in the bun was delicious. The shrimp were crispy and sweet and the mix with the slaw was perfect. The fish taco was disappointing. The fish wasn't very fresh and the toppings didn't enhance this taco. This was my first fish taco fail. The chicken taco was waaay too spicy for me that I took one bite and that was it. The flavour was great so if you love spice, you should definitely try this.",4.0,4.0,593,2017-11-15,43.641675,-79.431608,"Bars , Mexican"

Grand Electric,"So many people love this place- personally, I don't get it. We ordered the guacamole and I have to say it was really bland with no complex flavours at all. It's missing a lot of kick that for example, some more onions might provide. I honestly believe I can make a better guac. The tacos I ordered were also not that great either. Ordered the chorizo as well as the fish. They weren't terrible, as I don't think you can really mess up tacos- but again, definitely not something to write home about. Again, I think it was just too bland and not enough flavour. I associate Mexican food with complex flavours and this didn't give me any of that.On the other hand, the ambience is good. Really small- but cozy. However, if I'm out having tacos, I want more than just an atmosphere.

Grand Electric,"Came here for a Sunday night dinner date and it was a pleasant experience. The two of us split a Tuna Cevice and 4 tacos- pork carnita, pork belly, shrimp, mushroom. The amount of food was almost enough-- I think if we each ordered one more taco, or if we shared another dish, it would have been just perfect. The ceviche was really nice and tasty. Just the right amount of sweet and citrusy. The tacos were alright. My favourites were the shrimp taco and the mushroom taco. I don't know if I just don't like tacos but I've never ever ordered tacos from anywhere and thought, ""wow, now THIS is what all the hype is about"". With regards to the tacos here- the fillings were all very very tasty, I just found that there was too much ""bread"" in each bite.

Grand Electric,I know everyone's raving about the Baja but personally felt like the Cauliflower was much better. Wish they mixed the two: Baja fish taco ingredients (minus the fish) but with the cauliflower. Yummm... This is a small place in the Parkdale community with a cute patio where upon being seated I was warned about bees. I moved to the bar inside instead. They didn't have their orange hot sauce and were waiting on a shipment - I was told it's called Valentino and you can buy it in stores... here I was thinking it was made in-house... cmon Grand Electric!! Even though Grand Electric may have started the taco fiasco in Toronto... they're lacking in innovation.

Grand Electric,"This is my favourite place in the city for tacos! Everything on their menu is delicious and reasonably priced Imo. The flavours of their tacos are outstanding and complex, and each one leaves you wanting for more! Luckily, you'll have the ability to try a variety of them, since each taco is only 2 or 3 bites in portion size (beef cheek taco is my favourite!) . Although small, I find the tacos to be very filling and most people would probably get full from eating 4 to 5 of these. The other popular dish I always get from this place is the ceviche! The jalapeños in it give it a nice kick-and don't forget to try it with the tortilla shell at its base! =) The downside about eating here, however, is the long wait times to get a table. As the place does not take reservations, you'll have to arrive early to put your name down on the wait list. You can safely assume the wait to be at least 30 minutes on weekdays, and probably more than an hour on weekends. If you just want to try the food here without the dine in experience, you can save some time by ordering take out instead =) My greatest wish would be for them to open another location outside of Parkdale! That way I can get my taco fix on more frequently =D",4.0,5.0,593,2017-08-06,43.641675,-79.431608,"Bars , Mexican"
Grand Electric,"My dreams of finding a baja fish tacos that can match my experience in Chicago and San Diego continues and the next stop was Grand Electric.  This place has interested in me in a long time as I often see it on many Toronto best Taco list.   Most of the time it also is on 'packed in like a sardine' list as well.  On a Sunday afternoon, this was half filled and the breeze was coming in nicely since they opened up the front windows.  This place is not very large... maybe 10 tables that can fit 2 to 4 and a few more at the bar.  We had our pick of tables since it was mostly empty.  Unlike what I've read, the atmosphere on a Sunday afternoon is super relaxed.  Our tables weren't bumped up against another and it was very clean.  We probably we were the first ones sitting at the table that day.The waitress was super pleasant and quickly filled our water glasses and took our order quickly.  We decided on the same or similar type of tacos we ordered at 7 lives and El Local Loco to compare how it holds up.  We got the baja fish, crispy cauliflower, pork carnitas, and spicy chicken.  Overall, comparing it to the other 2 Toronto places we've tried, you could debate that it is better than El Local Loco but I think 7 Lives still squeak past Grand Electric to hold the title of best taco in Toronto.  I didn't have much tummy space after indulging at Tempered Room so I only ate 2 of the selections.Baja Fish - My favourite taco!  Grand Electric did an pretty good job on this one.  The batter was crispy and seasoned.  The fish wasn't overcooked or dried out.  The toppings of mayo, salsa, cabbage, cilantro and raddish was good as it added a crunch and creaminess.  I found though it had maybe too much mayo as it was mostly just creamy with very little tanginess or heat to really up the flavour of it.  Solid taco but just didnt have the same wow factor as ones I've had at 7 Lives.  4/5Crispy Cauliflower - This is an excellent vegetarian taco.  Crispy tempura'd cauliflower is covered in pickled serrano, mole sauce, and green onions.  The texture is very good... the batter is light and not oily while the cauliflower is tender inside.  The pickled serrano is perfect as it adds a touch of good heat while giving it an acidic kick that's needed.  The only drawback was that the green onions was a bit heavy handed and sometimes I only got a mouthful of green onion.  Overall, still very good and I'd order this again 4/5Service here was quick (less than 10 minutes to get our food) and very fast.  We were in and out of here in under 40 minutes.  Definitely a good place to grab a bite on Sunday if you're looking for some good tacos.",4.0,4.0,593,2017-06-25,43.641675,-79.431608,"Bars , Mexican"

Grand Electric,"To be fair, I visited Toronto in Summer '17 and randomly wound up here + had an amazing experience (4-5 stars). Came back into town Winter '17 and made this one of my first stops based on the first experience -- sadly, this one was terrible (0 stars). First, the wait staff was endlessly confused (seemed like the two working waitresses were competing for our table, so we'd place an order with one and then the other would show up 2 seconds later to do the same thing. This happened 3x times, not a huge issue in the grand scheme of things).Then things really went sideways. I wanted to get the chicken wings (which I had on visit 1, and were amazing then) but when I asked to get it ""without the crema"" I was told in the most condescending tone that ""we don't do modifications here."" Guess I missed the part where they won a Michelin star and thought that their $9.99 wings were the best on the planet/not to be messed with. Ugh, fine, I guess, I really want those wings... Then when they finally arrived they're basically lathered with some gross white spooge that could have EASILY not been applied from whatever squeeze bottle in the back it came from, utterly disgusting. If this was a soup or something made en masse I'd understand the ""no modifications"" thing, this was a freaking add on that I didn't want but was forced to take. Beyond stupid.The final straw was when the check came and they messed up the bill. When we pointed to the menu and asked them to please fix the mistake the same b-word waitress angrily shot back with ""well let me go check with my manager."" Not, ""oh yeah let me go fix that"" or anything remotely agreeable... 5 minutes later she returns and tosses a loonie at us with a ""here"" -- nevermind the tax/tip would now be off because of it. I know, I know, ""it's just a dollar"", but really at this point it was the principle of the thing and F this place in the ear.Bottom line: Get over yourself, you hole-in-the-wall dive restaurant that can't do math...",4.0,2.0,593,2017-12-11,43.641675,-79.431608,"Bars , Mexican"

The Smokey Bourbon Ceasar.  it's delicious.  You'll thank me for this later.There is a bit of a wait sometimes with this place.  But it's worth the wait.  There's been many times that I just put my name on the list and grab a drink nearby to come back.  It really is my favourite place to go in Parkdale.",4.0,4.0,593,2017-12-27,43.641675,-79.431608,"Bars , Mexican"
Grand Electric,"People rave about this place - and I *think* I see why, though it isn't necessarily because of the food. Grand Electric has an atmosphere + ambiance that makes you *feel* like you're having a good time - it has an intimate community atmosphere where it's lively, casual, and you feel nothing awkward. It fuels the idea that you're having just a plain ol' good time with friends over good drinks and food. And that warrants this place's popularity and stars.We dropped by a weekday evening around 6:30 PM, and this place was jammed - there aren't many seats to begin with. So note - if you don't want to share a communal table or be stuck waiting at the door. There's also a good amount of paid street parking in front of the restaurant.In terms of the food itself (which we came for), I actually think there are tastier taco joints in Toronto. We ordered the nachos platter which came with different dips (a good-sized portion, and good for a group), and a variety of tacos. They weren't bad - not excellent, but they were alright (if I remember correctly, the Baja Fish taco was the standout for us).Overall, I think if you come here, you're visiting for more than just the food - you're here for the atmosphere, the hip & casual spot to grab drinks with friends, and for the community. But if you're coming here solely to look for life-changing Mexican food, I'd look elsewhere.",4.0,3.0,593,2017-04-26,43.641675,-79.431608,"Bars , Mexican"

The beef cheek taste just like the sweet Asian spice mix beef my grandmother makes which was definitely a new take on beef tacos.

Our server was lovely and asked if we'd ever been there as she went through the menu with us. We ordered the polenta and meat balls to start, which were phenomenal. The serving comes with either 3 or 5 meat balls (I don't remember) so we ended up fighting over who got the bigger half of the remaining ball. I had the steak for my entree which was delicious. I eat my steak blue, which I find is hard to order in restaurants because most places overcook their steaks, but this was cooked perfectly. My fiancé ordered one of the pizzas.

L’Unita,"The highlight of a Summer night outingIn all aspects of life, one takes comfort in relying on excellent purveyors, service providers and restaurateurs. L'unita is such an establishment which can be counted on to be the torchbearer for hearty, unpretentious Italian cuisine in our fair city. There are few other Italian restos that have been as consistent over nearly a decade as this wildly popular Av & Dav Mecca. For us,  L'Unita represented the ideal dining experience whereas Il Fornaro, also on Avenue Rd., was the nightmarish opposite. Great food coupled with poor service can suck all the joy out of dining out. However, at L'unita you'll find the service standard equal to everything coming out of the kitchen. John, our server, exemplifies intelligent, polite, unobtrusive yet always present when needed level of service. The simplest, and yet often missed, an indicator of attentiveness is on how timely a basis water glasses are filled. No need to ask here as it was replenished with nary a mention from me. Two of us begin with the Lamb Spiedini (skewers) on an apricot conserve and a gremolata of fresh mint. In presentation, taste and portion size one couldn't find a fault with this app. The lamb was tender and incredibly tasty, with the apricot and mint complementing and enhancing the dish. While one chose the Cucumber and Strawberry Salad w watercress, arugula, poppy seeds and Parmigiano. Which they rated as quite good and delicious, what more could you ask for? The three of us unanimously and without too much discussion hone in on the Grilled Albacore Tuna sided with green beans, summer radish, smoked potatoes & tonnato sauce. Thank goodness we did. Soon after our plates arrive the table fell silent and the only audible sound were quiet moans of culinary joy. We were in agreement that this was probably the best Tuna dish we have had in our collective dining lives. How does one equal, never mind top, such an outstanding three-star main course? By employing an immensely talented pastry chef. For dessert, everyone picked a different offering which covered the whole menu.One opted for the Espresso Panna Cotta with chocolate mascarpone, amaretto caramel & coffee crumble. While the quantity on the plate seemed modest they needed ""my help"" to finish the dish. The rich, smooth and wonderfully rendered dessert left us with a smile of satiated joy. The other diner was drawn to the Vanilla Pound Cake with lemon curd and miniature meringues. An attractive plate garnished with fresh mint leaves managed to balance sweet and tart nicely. I chose the slightly restrained but no less satisfying Goat's Cheese with an ash rind accompanied by a peach marmalade, wildflower honey and crostini. The cheese was served at the right temperature, critical to really appreciating its strong lingering flavour, and the desired sharpness contrasted beautifully by the marmalade and incredible honey sourced from a local apiary. By omission and certainly not intentionally it has been five years since my last meal at L'Unita. I have no intent on waiting for another five to repeat such a pleasurable dining experience.",4.0,4.0,92,2017-07-20,43.674374,-79.396707,Italian
L’Unita,"I came here on Friday with my husband and my parents. We had an amazing time at this restaurant!! Our reservations were for 6:45, and we didn't leave until 11:30, if that's any indication of how much fun we have!To start with, the restaurant is beautiful and quaint. Although the restaurant is quite narrow, it is made to look bigger because the walls are lined with mirrors. It really does have a romantic atmosphere - it's quite dark and every table had candles. The service was excellent - attentive, but not overly attentive. We started with the swordfish crudo, which was a special, and the arancini. The arancini were nicely cooked, flavourful and I appreciated the addition of the butternut squash. Everyone loved the swordfish, which was fresh and light. For my entree, I had a pizza with pepperoni. The crust and base for the pizza is really nice and crispy. It was excellent, and I would definitely order it again! I had a piece of my mom's pizza, which had primarily sausage on it. It was alright, but the sausage was quite sweet rather than savoury, which I wasn't expecting.

In other ones, I imagine I could easily find elsewhere. Ambiance 3.5/5 (15% of final grade)They had a little booth with a little candle for my party of three, which was really nice to chat in. That is, before a bigger group of people came in and sat right next booth and it got really loud. The washroom itself was also very nice, with thick napkins. The stairs leading down to the washroom had rather narrow steps though, so be careful.Service 3.5/5 (15% of final grade)We were promptly seated, and everything was quite standard. The reason why I upped it to 3.5 instead of 3/5 is because they accommodated with my request for hot water, and brought it in a very well placed metal teapot with a ceramic cup and a wedge of lemon. The thoughtfulness in this placement was very cute, considering that it was free of charge. I would give another half point for their product knowledge when they asked us if we had any questions for them, but the tone of voice they had was very unenthusiastic and sort of indifferent at best. That being said, our cups were almost always filled, and they gladly gave us more free bread when asked.Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade)What the food lacked in taste they made up for in presentation. For the $38 2016 Summerlicious menu, the experience wasn't ""OMG SO MUCH VALUE"". I can calmly say that it wasn't expensive for what it was, but it wasn't particularly affordable either.Other 3/5 (10% of final grade)The arrangement of the food was very visually appealing.Final Grade = 67/100 = 3 StarsTLDR: The ambiance is nice enough for it to be a date-spot, but the food itself isn't something I would look back to craving. The presentation of the food was really nice though.",4.0,3.0,92,2016-07-26,43.674374,-79.396707,Italian
L’Unita,"We've been here numerous times and it's always been fabulous. We always get the server to pick some delicious stuff for us and eat based on their reccomendations (believe me it's the best way to do it!!!!). The food is always excellent, top notch ingredients and quality. If you go you must try...- the pork chop: to die for with sautéed leeks and cauliflower- the braised cauliflower: kind of like buffalo cauliflower you see most places but not fried!! - the asparagus and prosciutto pizza: I think this may be seasonal :( - sweet pea Aranccini balls - any of their delicious stuffed pastas Really anything you have will be exceptional.

I requested a quiet area and when I arrived not only was my request granted beyond my expectation but the manager remembered me by name and made a point to say hello. Now for the important stuff! Service... Our server the first time was very sweet and pleasant but the second time... Blew us away. Our server Laura was amazing!!! She was hands down one of the best servers I've had in a long time! I never had to ask for a single thing, my cup was always filled before I even realized it was getting empty, my plates were taken swiftly and promptly after being finished and all was done with such a pleasant demeanour that I was compelled to return the next day with my family!I love when a restaurants food is amazing but then is followed up my good service! Now for the food...Delicious! Everything was perfection. Nothing overlooked, bland or dry. Simple but bold flavours and the hand made pasta well...to die for.

I had the burger (nothing to write home about). Important: the fries were fat instead of skinny.The food came pretty slowly and service wasn't that great either, but I forgive them because it was so packed on a weekday.

Both our waitress and the bartender were awesome -- super attentive and friendly. As for the food, we started off with the calamari which had a very rubbery taste (I guess because it didn't look like it was battered). I've definitely had better calamari and wouldn't get that again from here. For my main dish I got the fish tacos which I must say I found very bland. There was too much on the tortilla to even wrap it up like a taco and the tortilla itself was extremely thin so it kept ripping. My boyfriend got the Local Burger with fries which he said was a decent burger. I loved how it was a large portion of fries they served with the burger that also tasted great.

Local 1794,"I just moved to the East York area 4 days ago, and I've already been to Local 1794 twice!  I called ahead to book reservations, since the reviews online are so good, and they're always busy I wanted to be sure they would have a table available for us!  The food was fantastic, but keep in mind that the place is a bit up-scale. Don't come in expecting nachos or chicken strips.  When asked, the server said that nachos are available on the ""late night menu"" which is only after 11pm, and would not accommodate my request at 9:30pm when I asked to order some. The only other negative experience was when I  ordered extra dipping sauce, and the server told us ""you can ask me for more once you're done the one you have"". We both felt that this was condescending and we were being treated like we're 4 years old by being told we need to finish what we have before we can have more. Because the server got busy, we ran out of dipping sauce and by the time she brought more (the wrong kind) 20 minutes later, all of our food was cold, so we just got everything to go. It seems like a small/petty thing, but this one small thing sorta ruined the whole evening - all over a side of chipotle mayo :( That being said, I still recommend this place and give 4 stars based on the manager's apology to me, and the food/service was otherwise perfect!",4.0,4.0,82,2017-07-25,43.684431,-79.318825,"Canadian (New) , Gastropubs"

Local 1794,"this is episode...nah...no one here would get it. anyways, one of the restaurants on my ""bucket list"" to visit was this one, again promoted by BLOGTO this place came to light, I was fascinated by the décor and the menu options that were available. lets start with the name...which is utterly genius! local to the area, and 1794, the numbered address of the building(in correlation to the danforth avenue)I got off the subway at coxwell and honestly couldn't wait to sit down and eat, after a walk that felt like forever(five minutes) I was finally sitting down looking at this gorgeous menu. full disclosure, ALOT of yummy things are on this page and available for eating, to the point where you almost have a tiny bout of depression, because your stomach is only so big. the staff here were absolutely top notch, I sat down reading the menu and the waitress instantly came over with a glass of water filled with ice well, she promptly asked me if I wanted more water, which I responded with a yes, and she came back with a ""ikea korken"" bottle filled with cold water. back to the menu, I was on a bit of a budget, and settled on a couple of things, I couldn't help the ambience and the awesome music that was playing, as I watched people just talk and enjoy the setting. my app's came to my table, very hot and very fresh, some of the best calamari I've had in recent years, definitely far from subpar, the piri piri shrimp was also dynamite, proper flavor and balance with the heat, a perfect seafood starter, even with the order that I place, I wanted maybe two more pieces of each. I also had a poutine to start, as an absolute poutine fiend, I can tell you that this is no standard poutine, awesome gravy rich and full of flavor, awesome curds that are so fresh they squeak between the teeth, and last but not least the potatoes, perfect cut that has done a ballad with proper oils when fried, and light even though its a starch, just beautiful, blissful, and dare I say orgasmic. time for the main course, the star of the hour, and the Canadian MVP down to the foundation of Canadian cuisine, mac and cheese. I will not lie to you, this plate of cheesy noodle goodness arrived to my table with 3 feet of steam/heat coming off of it...very VERY impressed with this, I feel personally this doesn't happen very often when I go to restaurants that food is that cold. I cannot stress about the service, the quality of food, and just everything from start to finish, was fantastic. this experience was more then just a transaction between me and them, I felt like family coming in here with the attention I received from the waitress, and saw the equal attention being given to all of the eaters in the establishment. one of my new favorites in Toronto, I wish I was local to the area, I see nothing but the best for this place in the future.

Local 1794,"This place was such a nice surprise! I've been trying to find a nice, reasonable restaurant on the Danforth that would please my picky parents. I thought the menu was a bit safe when I saw it online, but it had several vegetarian options for my stepmum and a few interesting plates for my more adventurous dad.The service was. Out. Standing! They servers were attentive, friendly, accommodating and cheerful. The room was comfortable, and I thought the outlet at each booth was a nice touch for those who needed to charge their devices or computers. The music was Motown covers of top 40 songs, which was fantastic as it appealed to everyone regardless of age. And it seemed like the sort of place that could be open at all hours, in the good sense. I can easily see this place having great plates for breakfast, lunch and dinner. My only gripe is that they don't offer half litres for wine - there's a choice of two glass sizes or a bottle. But that's the worst thing I can say about the place.My stepmum went with the vegetarian meatballs and ended up ordering a kale and quinoa salad after, as the app sized dish wasn't large enough (which she was advised of when she ordered by the server), dad got the mushroom risotto and I had the steak. Everything was cooked really well and came out beautifully plated. Once I ate I realized why the menu read 'simple' - it's all familiar but perfectly cooked dishes. It's exactly the sort of place every neighbourhood needs. Regardless of age, this place had something for you, whether it's a fresh salad or an adventurous Boar pizza.

Mill Street Beer Hall,"I get the feeling that a lot of people downvoting this place are way too snooty when it comes to expectations. While the Beer Hall may not set the world on fire, I found my experience there last night to be great across the board. Sure, there are a few minor quibbles, but I judge restaurants and businesses based on a combination of factors. That a restaurant may have overpriced food is a minor point if the location, service and ambiance makes up for it.My friends and I were searching for a restaurant in the Distillery District when we happened upon this place. Faced with some ridiculous wait times to get into some of the other restaurants (2 hours? REALLY?), we settled for a 45-minute waitlist and loitered around for a friend to show up. It became clear that it was worth the wait as soon as we got inside.I will point out that while some of the food may be overpriced, I've been to plenty of restaurants (including two days ago, as of this writing) that try to charge upwards of $30 just for apps, so having entrees that run from $20-40 is not surprising in the least. Everyone was well taken care of, and despite the concerns I've read here about the service, our waiter was a helpful individual who even put up with us switching seats on occasion (throwing the delicate numbering system he had for each diner out of whack).After all, this is the Distillery District. You're paying to sit in a heritage site, just down the street from Soulpepper Theatre (shout-out to my boy William Webster). It's just part of the area.I ended up going for the Raspberry Lemonade ($9) and the Hopped-Up Mac'n Cheese ($14). The portion sizes are big, and the lemonade is deceptively strong - I was feeling extremely buzzed even after sipping it. Don't shotgun that one. The Mac'n Cheese was impressively messy, and I soon understood why they serve it with a spoon. It's incredibly difficult to scoop the long pasta noodles out with a fork. The garlic butter biscuit it was served with tasted stale, though I'm not sure if it was intended to be that way or it had sat out too long.My friends had a mix of flatbreads and salads, and all reported them to be excellent. I also had the chance to try some of the peach cider, which was also deceptively strong. It tastes like iced tea but is much more powerful than it lets on.This may quickly become a favored destination in the Distillery if the staff can keep the quality of service as high as they did last night. The experience was great overall, and I've been left with lingering memories of the pleasant atmosphere as the sun set and the great times with friends.The Beer Hall is well worth a look if you're in the area.",3.0,4.0,128,2017-07-16,43.650442,-79.358443,"Gastropubs , Bars , Canadian (New)"

Mill Street Beer Hall,"Had a super fun night here Friday night (just a couple days ago). My friend and I had just driven in from Rochester, NY, basically in a blizzard, and missed our 7 pm reservation by a whole hour. Our host where we were staying called on our behalf and they agreed to respect the reservation, so we walked in around 8 pm and were taken direct to our table in the bar.We had a great waitress, Bryn (?) who helped us pick beers for our flights, and provided extra details about the poutine that we each ordered as our entrees: the cheese curds are cold though the fries, gravy and brisket are hot....isn't that always how poutine is served??We loved the very American roots-rock music selection played by the DJ, thought the noise level was acceptable, and enjoyed our conversation with Bryn, our beers and our meal.

Mill Street Beer Hall,"Came here for dinner Sunday after checking the Christmas Market. Apparently there are two Mill Street restaurants, they told us this ""Beer Hall"" one is more German style food, while their other ""Mill St Brew Pub"" is more pub/bar type food. We decided to go for this one.I will echo on some of the other reviews in that their service isnt the greatest. The waiter did not seem interested in serving us. His mood worsened when we asked for just water first before deciding on any drinks. At the end, when we asked for the visa machine, he didnt acknowledge he had heard us, so obviously we asked again and he said in a non-caring rude manner ""Yeah I got it"". Thanks?The food here is A-OK hence they are really 3 stars but minus one for service. Elk burger was good, duck fat fries served semi-cold, and the curry chicken on greens lacked chicken (fried chickpeas were amazing though). Wouldn't come back unless other restaurants in the distillery district have long wait times. Recommend Clunys nearby if you want some good fushion French cuisine which also isn't much more expensive.",3.0,2.0,128,2016-12-05,43.650442,-79.358443,"Gastropubs , Bars , Canadian (New)"

Mill Street Beer Hall,"Located in the Distillery District in Toronto, a national historic site that combines dining and shopping among the remains of the Gooderham & Worts Distillery, this restaurant combines both an outdoor patio and a modern brewpub. Inside, on one end of the long restaurant, fans were cheering on the local team. On the other end, curtains closed off a private party. Curiously, the restaurant was only half full, for a Friday evening during the summer. We joined a dinner that was already in progress both hungry and exhausted. Most had not had dinner yet, instead had nibbled on a variety of appetizers before we arrived. So I was able to sample a charcuterie platter and enjoy a flavorful pâté (so good we scraped the jar clean) spread on crostini while catching up with family and deciding on the entrée.In the end, I liked the grilled swordfish, served with couscous and sautéed greens. It was both hearty and tender - not spicy, despite being marinated in Sriracha yogurt - and served with a thick and creamy peanut sauce. The separate order of fries was a plate of golden-brown deliciousness.Service was odd. When we requested a new fork to replace the one that dropped, we were given an obviously dirty (not semi-dirty or even ""dirty if you look carefully"" dirty) fork.",3.0,3.0,128,2016-09-15,43.650442,-79.358443,"Gastropubs , Bars , Canadian (New)"

The waitress was great, she took the other dish off our bill and rushed my mac & cheese. Great service.

Mill Street Beer Hall,"Please note that I am writing this review for my LATEST DINING EXPERIENCE ONLY. I live relatively close to the Distillery and have always loved coming to Mill Street Beer Hall. The food is not the greatest of all time, but I have always come back for the great service. Unfortunately, my visit on Wednesday Aug 24 was just disheartening. I went with a friend for afternoon drinks after a long and sad day and was looking forward to the USUALLY great service I have always encountered at the Beer Hall.. Unfortunately, it was quite the opposite. We both work in the service/hospitality industry so we know how stressful it could get at times... but we walk in and made eye contact with the servers/hosts/bartenders and did not receive even one smile or acknowledgement of our presence so it was a reeeeally awkward first few minutes. The host that led us to our table was talking to us with a pen in his mouth...... ummm what? I really did not understand this. Was this a concept he was trying???? An #AESTHETIC???? We were very confused..... Like no harm done dude, but I felt the need to state this as we were just very curious and a bit wierded out.... He also looked sort of in pain, but like the artistic angry pain, like ""It's me against the world"" type of pain. Sir, if you ever come across this review....... I hope you are feeling better :) But yeah, this led to another cringy/awkward moment as we walked to our table because the host was just confusing. But no harm done!! It was our server that was disappointing. Oh Jesse.... we tried really hard to like you!!! I am so sorry. You seem like a really nice guy, but unfortunately, we weren't too pleased with the lack of attention. In the end, we even asked him how busy it was ( if he had a lot of tables to look after I would understand the neglect....) but he even said how ""the place was dead"". The highlight of our encounters with Jesse was us trying to make awkward eye contact and waving because a bee fell into my friend's beer and we wanted a new glass..... but he was too busy flirting and trying to put his arm around another server (blonde with sunglasses). Don't get me wrong... you guys were cute and we wish you all the luck but we just wanted to drink our beer in a new glass. :( We had the Belgian Wit for drinks. 10/10 I love Mill St beer. My friend had the Mac And Cheese and Sweet Potato Fries. She was not pleased with either, she said they were too plain. I tried the biscuit that came with the Mac & Cheese and TBH, it was stale and whack. The sweet potato fries are always a safe choice though. So rating for food was like 5/10 Like I still suggest you guys give this a try though!!!!! Maybe it was just an off day for them.... who knows.",3.0,2.0,128,2017-08-25,43.650442,-79.358443,"Gastropubs , Bars , Canadian (New)"
Mill Street Beer Hall,"Dear Mill Street, there are MANY options and you should not be on anyone's top list. Not returning to this place again. Our company decided to have the end of summer party here. We were given a private area with our own cook. The service ""in particular the person managing our party"" was absolutely useless. The company ordered food for 50 people. I did a headcount while there because I was upset that they had ran out of food and we were only 43 people. They sliced the chicken breast into 4 pieces, ran out of ribs, ran out of mushrooms, forgot the potato salad and still gave us attitude! We had to wait for over 40 minutes to get more meats.

Mill Street Beer Hall,"This was my first time here, and I was pleasantly surprised. Distillery District is gorgeous, and this place was casual, but up-to-scale for Distillery. Think Biermarkt, but upscale, less rowdy, and more fusion food. We were a group of 12 that had made dinner reservations. Our table was available 20 minutes early which was great, since 3/4 of a party had arrived early. Everyone was impressed with the space. Clean, bold, rustic/industrial. Our servers were really patient with our ""chill/confusing"" ordering vibe. We started with drinks and since the order was taking a bit long, they gave us some samples! Food: I had the duck confit wings which were DELICIOUS. and the Elk burger which was GOOD, but hard to eat since it was stacked really high. I ended up having to pick out the pickle and eat it on the side. I also had the fish tacos which were good, but nothing special. I shared this with one other person. People around the table ordered beet salad, pizzas, sandwiches, and one person got the schnitzel. Good reviews for everything except the Margherita pizza which was not as saucy as my friend wanted. Drink: I heard good things about the beermosa and the long island ice tea. The design-your-own flights were a huge hit! The beerschnapps was gross - I order a round for the table and regret my decision, haha. All in all, a good experience.

Maybe we should of taken that as a sign.The place has plenty of seats. It's always massively busy during the Christmas Market so plan accordingly if you come here during that time.  There is plenty of spacing though, which is a great thing if you have children. We came with 4 other families totaling 7 children and we were sat very well with plenty of room for the strollers as well.When it comes to this place, I would recommend you stick with the drinks and the apps.  They were all pretty good and well done.  As for the entree food, I was less than impressed to say the least.  My GF ordered a flat bread and I had the Arctic Char entree.  The flat bread was passable at best but my char was very disappointing.  I got 2 little pieces about the size of a Doritos chip.  There were about 6 potato balls and some twigs pretending to be a salad.  There were some candied bacon bits and they were unfortunately the best part of the dish.  The knockout blow comes from the $26 price, ouch.  I could go to a HK Style cafe or Hakka restaurant and feed about 3 people for the same price.This places saving grace is the service.  We had the most awesome waitress ever.  She was nice, funny, helpful and just and overall great person.  She really seemed like she loved being there and passed on the good vibes to everyone around.  She was an all around treat to deal with.  I didn't enjoy my meal at all, but she definitely softened the blow.I totally recommend this place for drinks.  If you want dinner though, I would say only if you absolutely must.",3.0,3.0,128,2015-12-15,43.650442,-79.358443,"Gastropubs , Bars , Canadian (New)"

She then looked at us again and asked if we had spoken to someone. To which we replayed, yes you, and she looked baffled.Also the drinks for two of our group didn't show up and we had to remind the wait staff several times that they never got their drinks - maybe hire more people if your staff is over worked?With the exception of the poutine trio none of the group through the food was very good.

On one hand I wasn't exactly loving my meal when I had it at the time but when I look back at it, it was a pretty decent bowl of warm slurpy noodle soup goodness.To my surprise we managed to get a seat on a Friday evening without even waiting, has the hype died down that much here? We went with their kara miso ramen (spicy) and a bowl of tsukemen for variety and both were definitely priced higher than I would have liked. Were they a good bowls of ramen? Yes, it's overly authentic and there's quality here just like what they have in Japan but considering the lack of proteins and portions here, it's hard to justify spending $40 on two bowls of ramen. That being said the broth here was incredibly rich and delightful. It has got meaty tones, it's thick, and it's powerful. It warms up your soul but I found the normal salt level overwhelming so I'd recommend asking for less salt for a much more pleasant and palatable experience. The noodles were also pretty good here and were perfectly al-dente.",4.0,3.0,667,2018-01-30,43.656322,-79.3775,"Ramen , Noodles"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,"So, after all the hype, I finally decided to come here, and it did not live up to the hype. I will say that the ambiance feels authentic and very distinctly Japanese (or while we were there it did). It was reminiscent of going to Japan, packing into small little noodle shops, and ordering from a friendly, but not overbearing waitress. Food comes fast, and portions are large. Sidenote, this would be a really weird date spot, people are packed in pretty tight, and if you're on an awkward first date (which the funny couple beside us was), people will know :P Where they lost me was the actual food. The noodles were good, but the soup is just TOOOOOOO SALTY. I get that noodles need to have a strong soup, but flavourful =/= salty, and this meant that I couldn't drink any of the soup, nor did I particularly want all the noodles. The meat on the noodles is more than I would have expected from a ramen house, and there are also other veggies, which is a nice touch.  'Would I come back? Probably not, there are so many places that do noodles in Toronto, why waste time (and calories) on the subpar?",4.0,2.0,667,2018-01-24,43.656322,-79.3775,"Ramen , Noodles"

I have been told by several friends that Santouka is arguably the best ramen in Toronto. I've had very good ramen in Japan in the past so that would be hard to beat. But let's dive right into the review!Looking at the bowl when it first comes the meats and veggies are very well aligned and presented. No complaints about anything there! The bowl looks kind of small but after starting to eat i realized they pack in a lot of noodles; I was surprised! Trying the smooth broth, it was extremely delicious. Probably the closest you can get to ramen broth in Japan. The noodles on the other hand were slightly less chewy than ones I've had in Japan and is my only complaint in this bowl. In terms of the price, my girlfriend paid for it and didn't seem to complain, so it must be fairly priced! And for the amount of noodles I received the price is justified.The service here is fantastic! The waiters and waitresses work really fast and are very friendly. Overall, the ramen here has impressed me and I can confidently confirm that this is one of the best ramen restaurants in Toronto. I will definitely revisit time and time again for many years.

I was pretty crabby having to wait in line for 30 minutes FREEZING my tush off in the windy cold. Okay, maybe not the first noodle... had to try the soup as well before I could regain composure. The interior is very small and cramped, even the stairs down to the bathroom are smaller than usual, and I had to duck my head down and almost CRAWL to get to the bathroom. I felt like I was in a cave... but hey, it was an experience! ;)I ordered a Shoyu ramen for myself, and my boyfriend got the Char Siu Ramen. I won't say anything more about his soup than what he told me when I asked how his was, ""good"" - and then about a minute later his bowl was completely cleaned out.My favorite part of my soup was the bamboo shoots, oddly enough.

Luckily it was raining so not as much people were willing to venture out. Instead of waiting 30-45 minutes, we waited for about 15.I ordered the combo meal: a regular size spicy miso ramen, which came with marinated egg and a small pork rice bowl. My bf ordered the special, jalapeno ramen. I think the ramens were pretty darn good, but wouldn't recommend the combo sides. Ajitsuke tamago (aka marinated egg) is supposed to be soft boiled with a runny yolk. Instead this version was way overcooked and not at all flavorful. And the pork rice bowl was pretty basic.

Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,"Came to Santouka for a late dinner at 10 PM on Labour Day, and nice to see that they were still operating regular hours and closing at 11.When you sit down, they offer a ""bag basket"" where you can place your bags or purses, which is a nice gesture because I'd prefer not having to put a bag on the ground, or taking up the seat beside me.The menu comes with several different types of ramen,  We ordered the shoyu and miso, at $12.45 each. For an extra $1, you can upsize it to a large bowl which they claim is 1.5x larger than their regular size. You might as well throw in the extra dollar! The bowls do not come with egg however; it costs $1.60 to add an egg. I don't know if this is all bowls, but the two bowls we ordered didn't come with an egg. At least, the staff had informed us that we needed to add an egg.Bowls arrived within 5 minutes. The large bowl is definitely larger than the regular, with more noodles, broth, and toppings. The broth is quite flavorful and not very oily. There were 3 pieces of chashu, and they weren't particularly uniform in shape or size. One was long and ovaloid, another was short and round. But they were very tender and also flavorful. The noodles were not impressive, as it felt like I was eating egg noodles. It would be better if the noodles were a bit thicker and chewier.The washrooms are in the basement, and not very accessible.The men's washroom comes with a baby-changing station, whereas the women's does not. An interesting option. Also comes with a bottle of listerine and some small cups, if you need to rinse off afterwards.Overall, it's a nice bowl of ramen. The prices here are definitely higher than most of its competition, but if it's the closest option that you have, it's still a nice meal.",4.0,4.0,667,2017-09-06,43.656322,-79.3775,"Ramen , Noodles"

The path to the washroom was a bit scary as it was down the stairs. I decided to order the Shoyu Ramen and it was presented very nicely on a uniquely shaped tray. The noodles had a very silky texture and the pork was extremely tasty. The ramen was very flavourful and not overly salty. The portion was fairly reasonable as it wasn't too little or too much, but just enough to satisfy your hunger.

Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,"My buddy from the states was in town and was craving some Ramen. This place is known for its good Ramen and long line ups. Thankfully we arrived off peak and were seated within seconds. The service was stupidly good. Smiles, thank you's and frequent (but not uncomfortable) check ins were all provided. The food arrived quick and was delicious. Broth wasn't overly salty. Pork was perfectly cooked. My only beef to pick with this place is the price. $13+ for a soup. Don't get me wrong, they're doing great things but I don't see how on earth they can charge $13+ dollars for a soup. It's madness. But then again what do I know - the line up is still out the door (but maybe that's why millennials cant afford to buy a house. Good but pricey for what it is.

And the ikura may as well have not been there.. The ramen had two skinny chopstick shaped pieces of pork - no more like two french fries. The soup was decent. The noodles itself were stale.

Fieramosca,"Heading out to the ROM for FNL with friends, we wanted some hearty, not to mention tasty, food before our evening out. We were all running a little late, but they held our reservation. I arrived first; our table was at the back and ready. Not a large restaurant as it used to be a home. Classic features and comfortable chairs. So far, so good. The rest of our party arrived and our fabulous server was there to take our orders. Another server brought over a complimentary slice of bruschetta while we waited. Mmmmmm. He brought our drinks, a fresh bread basket and went over the specials. They sounded so good, I crumbled and ditched my original choice for the Stuffed Gnocchi with Mushrooms and Sundried Tomatoes in a Rose Sauce($22). My friends ordered Spaghetti Mare Di Mario(seafood in spaghetti for $25), Salisiccia E Quaglia Alla Griglia(4 types of meat for $28) and Bomba Pizza(cheese, green peppers, sausage, onions for $18).  After the bruschetta and trying to abstain from eating a whole loaf of bread, the food arrived. Hot and smelling amazing. After we were all done taking photos of each other's food, the table fell silent as we dug in. After we all tasted our food, we proceeded to share it. SO good. Healthy portions allowed us to share it without any of us feeling guilty. Everyone agreed my Gnocchi was to die for. The pizza was perfect; thin crust and lots of toppings. The 4 meat dish was polished off. All meats were seasoned perfectly. The seafood pasta had a heap of pasta under those clams! We were all so full, dessert wasn't even an option. The wine list was delightful. They offered perfect wines to compliment any meal Fieramosca has to offer.  Service was excellent. Great timing, didn't abandon us, but didn't bug us. Décor was classic and it didn't feel crowded even though it's a smaller space.  A great start to the evening!

Fieramosca,"You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life... at Fieramosca.  (You are old like me if you know that theme song!)Have you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?  That was our experience.Some call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.  If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.Reservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!Being in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.  So if you are even a little claustrophobic,  be warned, you won't be comfortable here.  The food:Complimentary bruschetta:  A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.Caesar salad:  Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.Bread basket:  Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread.  Spaghetti Carbonara:   The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca's version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.  Linguini DI Mamma Ninetta:  I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.Tiramisu:  No coffee flavour!  I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting.   Libretto's Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca's lacked.  My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.Lemon Sorbet:  Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy.  I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.  I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.  Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.Ladies, please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!  Ugh!TL;DR - Meh. Bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing.  Not worth a second visit.2 stars bumped to 3 because the service was good.The search for Pasta Carbonara continues... maybe a trip to NYC or even Rome!",4.0,3.0,74,2016-07-03,43.669499,-79.397444,Italian

East Thirty-Six,"I came here in a party of 9 for a Summerlicious dinner earlier this week. While I thought the food was overall okay (but on the more positive side of okay), the service was really excellent.We had a reservation made for 7pm, but due to some extenuating circumstances, we didn't get our table until 8pm. While ordinarily I would be less than pleased, the staff at East Thirty-Six offered us a free round of drinks (and then a second round when our table was delayed even further) as apology for the long wait. I tried ""A Mid-Summer's Night"", and had sips of ""Rouge Passion"". Overall, I'd say that their drinks are decently strong, and not overly sweet. They only had one bartender working the bar, so be prepared to wait a little bit for your drink if they're busy.Now, for the food! Pre-app: Fries and fried chicken skins with garlic mayo. I didn't really care for the fried chicken skins, but their garlic mayo was really delicious.App: Summer salad - celery, fennel, radish, green onion, tomato in a creamy dressing. I wasn't too enthusiastic about this one. My friends who ordered the other two apps (cucumber gazpacho w/ smoked salmon, or chicken liver) were happier with theirs. Entree: Flat iron steak - the steak was sous vide and cooked to medium (they aren't able to do any done-ness more rare than medium). The steak was excellent. It was juicy and cooked evenly throughout. I was more than happy with this one, although their vegetable garnish (grilled zucchini) was bitter. Dessert: Chocolate delice - this was more of a block of chocolate ganache with a piece of peanut brittle on top. This dessert was too rich for me even though I love chocolate - there wasn't enough salt on it to balance out the sweetness.Back to the service: All throughout dinner, the wait-staff were polite, friendly, and attentive enough without being overbearing. They were continually apologetic about the delay at the beginning of our meal, but I'm pretty sure all of us were over it by that point (that's how well they handled it).

East Thirty-Six,"They have some really great shareable plates and possibly one my favorite places to now get fries downtown.Food (4/5): Came here with a friend lured by their $1 oyster deal and East Thirty-Six did not disappoint. We ordered their fries with chicken skin, lamb burger, kimchi fries, then burrata. Now I've got to highlight their fries. I'm not sure what they do to them but its thick cut, soft in texture and flavorful as hell. How? I dunno, but along with the lemon aoili we ate it so fast that we had to try their kimchi fries. A side note on the chicken skin - not sure what it adds to the dish, but it made it interesting. Over to the kimchi fries. They do a great job. Kimchi flavor on par, not too saucy and a good balance of Korean flavors. Love love love. Lamb burger: soft patty, nice green sauce and great soft bun that altogether was an incredible mix of earthy flavors. It's quite a different meal and take on a burger in general, but bite after bite it grows on you and you are left wondering why you decided to share the burger. Burrata: okayy so it's burrata (sack of soft mozzarella cheese) paired with grilled buttercup squash, pureed eggplant and pangritata (crispy breadcrumbs aka poor man's Parmesan). While the mozzarella tasted like mozzarella, everything else was intensely flavored... and not in a good way. It felt like everything was screaming for attention in your mouth - eggplant was way too smokey, the pangritata was far too salty and the something freaky was happening with the squash. Mozzarella being mute on flavor was pretty much the star of this dish. I wouldn't order the Burrata again, however I would come back to try more of their shareable plates :)Price (3/5): My friend and i ordered 18 buck a shuck oysters, chicken fries, kimchi fries, lamb burger and then the burrata. Safe to say we were hella full and had to take home the kimchi fries. For 4 dishes it came up approx $60... so $30ish for each of us. It's a slightly pricey adventure, but I'm satisfied paying that much.Service (4.5/5): great! They are attentive, won't hesitate to answer questions and my water was always filled :) When the restaurant got busier it was alittle hard to grab their attention considering there were only 2 of them to take orders, serve food, and make drinks... heh. Ambiance (4.5/5): The place itself is small, but its very well furnished imo. The bar look classy and the although its a dark colored restaurant it's got an elevated flair to it. Safe to say, I'd bring someone here on a date :)All in all, great experience, great food, would come back!",4.0,4.0,140,2017-06-02,43.648453,-79.375071,"Cocktail Bars , Canadian (New)"

East Thirty-Six,"It was a Sunday night with me and another girlfriend. Very chilled out ambience, waitress was very easy going, kitchen staff very professional. We had two apps. The kimchi fries and the cauliflower. The cauliflower was soaked in oil hence it was very greasy. Nonetheless appetizing. The kimchi fries were yum :)The mains were the lamb burger and confeit chicken. Chicken was dry and lacked in flavor. The lamb was very VERY pungent (I know lamb has a distinctive taste and smell but the lamb obviously was not prepared properly or old!!!). We packed it to go hoping my boyfriend would eat it.As much as how the food should be delicious for the price we pay, the service was delightful.

East Thirty-Six,"This review is only based on their drinks, which were amazing. I stopped in here with a friend for a cocktail. The bartender was amazing. We sat at the bar so it was cool to watch him make all the drinks. He was knowledgeable about different types of drinks, wasn't annoyed by phrases like ""surprise me"", and took pride in each of his creations. This would be a great spot to grab a drink before doing something else on a date or a cute night out with the girls. It's a little fancier of a venue, but certainly not stuffy. It's not too expensive either, just feels expensive when you're in there so that's fun! I wish there were more appetizer options for foods to munch on, but for drinks it was great!

East Thirty-Six,"I really like this place! They have a lot of unique dishes that are fun to try! My friend and I got the bread loaf ($4), the squid ($10), and the lamb burger ($16) along with a beer and gin and tonic for happy hour. The bread was very good and I would recommend getting it to start off. The squid was similar to calamari and had a spicy sauce that went very well with it. I'm not much of a fish person so I didn't eat too much of it but it was still very tasty and if you're a fish person I'm sure you would enjoy it more. The lamb burger was my favorite though! It had a really good cilantro-type mayo on it as well as lettuce and fried onions.This all was a good amount to split and have a meal for two!

The food was all really good.We had pork belly, short rib, a cheese dish, lamb burger, and French fries with chicken skin. The pork belly was really tender. It had an egg on top that complimented the bread pieces and pork belly really well. The short rib was a perfect medium rare. The mashed potatoes and asparagus were really flavorful. The lamb burger had a lot of different flavors in it that went well together. The cheese dish was kinda funky. My friends enjoyed it a lot though. The fries and chicken made me laugh. It was under the vegetables section and we had to confirm with the server that salted chicken wasn't a misnomer and actually is what it said. It was good. They didn't relent on the salt. I topped it all off with a pretty well made dark and stormy.Everything was good. I would only recommend it if your group is willing to spend some money.

They were juicy on the inside and with a nice crispy rub on the outside. The ribs and sausage were good. But the brisket was a disappointment. I have been to Adamson BBQ a couple of times and their brisket is out of this world. Compared to Adamson, Barque's brisket is a bit tough. I won't be getting that again.

Barque Smokehouse,"3.5 stars Whoever is in charge of the menu or marketing is a bit of a genius... Barque Rack O'Bama.  Really??  This is honestly one of the best named dishes in Toronto and probably one of the key reasons why I tried this place before the other best Toronto BBQ places.Aside from the great name, Barque on Roncy is a nice family friendly bar.  Though the tables for 2 are really small and barely held the dishes on it, the space is bigger than most places on Roncy and you're not overly crowded.  There's a bit of bar seating for those who dont have a reservations and you do need a rez here.  It gets busy quickly on a Saturday with a constant flow of families.  Service here is friendly and fairly quick.  We were greeted and shown to our tables with no issues.  We had our food also delivered with an issue as well.Chopped Kale Salad - Ok I know I know... who gets a salad at a BBQ place.  Well I do cause I dont eat THAT much meat and I wasn't feeling mac & cheese or poutine side.  Which by the way looked monstrous.  We got a large and I will say its a very healthy size... easily feeds 2+.  It was nicely dressed and the pickled cabbage and carrots was a nice crunchy addition.  The fat white blobs of turnip... less so.  Mostly flavourless.  3.5/5Rib Taster - Star of the meal... you get 3 to 4 ribs per sauce flavour.  So the Barque Rack O'Bama, Sweet Heat, and Dry Rub.  I can safely say that the sauces and flavour is good.  There are definite clear smoke rings on these which is much better than most other places.  Were these tender?  Only one... the sweet heat.  Were they meaty? Kinda ... not really.  I found it weird they didnt take off the membrane on the ribs either so sometimes it felt like chewing through a tough plastic piece.  This is definitely above average ribs but I'm not sure I would order these automatically if I came back here.  3.5/5Brisket - We got a bit of the brisket as well and these were much better than the Smoke Signals and Carbon ones.  These were juicier and more tender.  And if you had the appetite of a hungry cub, you could order the larger size for only a few more dollars ($4 if I remember right).  Another good thing, I didnt feel the need to use the sauce for these.  Also, I liked how they were served above lukewarm temperatures (Carbon & Smoke was just barely warm)! 3.5/5Overall, it's a solid place on Roncy to dine with a group of family or friends.  Service is good and the food is solid too.  Though I dont think it's my favourite place in Toronto for BBQ, it can definitely understand why it is constantly filled on a Saturday night.",4.0,3.0,424,2017-10-24,43.64801,-79.449659,"Barbeque , Smokehouse"
Barque Smokehouse,"This place is delicious. Probably hands down one of my favourite BBQ places in the city and worth the trek to Roncy. We got a seat on the patio which was really nice and fully covered. When the sun went down they opened the top a little and the breeze felt amazing considering how hot the weekend was. Also, love that they had brown paper bags hanging around the patio. The server explained that this was to get rid of the pesky wasps - it worked! Didn't see a single wasp during dinner. First I started dinner with a candied bacon caesar - it was nice and spicy and flavourful. Definitely recommend it. They also have complimentary sparkling water to start. Service was really good throughout the night as well. Our table ordered the 4oz brisket, was nervous it would be too little to share but it was the perfect amount for 2 people. Absolutely LOVED the brisket. My favourite of the meal. We also ordered half a rack of ribs, smoked asparagus and the potato and leek salad. Would definitely recommend both sides. The asparagus gave a nice balance to our meal with the heavy potatoes and meat. They also don't cheap out on side portions so that was good to see.

Barque Smokehouse,"Lemon pepper dry rubbed ribs were out of this world-- seasoned and smoked to perfection at that perfect balance of toastiness and moist. Also, the smoked chicken wings were pretty amazing-- everything had the right amount of spice and was done perfectly.I even enjoyed the coleslaw, and I am not a coleslaw person because it's usually bad, but this was house-made (I assume) with a more vinegary base than the typical mayonnaisey mess that you usually get. Sides were good-- not exceptional but good.I subtract one star because it seems like they are perhaps working out some service issues-- it took a super long time for us to get our food and get seated. The server was quite apologetic about it, but I don't think it was at all his fault-- seemed kind of like there were some bigger structural issues going on (for example, it took us a long time to get seated and we arrived when they opened and there was no line). It was also pretty spendy for lunch, though I'm not sure if it was just a matter of us needing to order different things.",4.0,4.0,424,2017-10-11,43.64801,-79.449659,"Barbeque , Smokehouse"

The hostess took my information on an iPad, which allowed me to go grab coffee and wander until I could be seated. I was called when my table was ready and promptly seated. My table service was very efficient and polite. I quite liked my server! She was fantastic and considering how many tables she was managing, she was quite the pro. Timing was perfect for everything. Not too fast and not too slow. Just right.Food:I ordered the smoked duck pancakes, which come with a berry compote and a whipped chevre. Duck is quite delicious and most known for being a particularly tender and juicy meant, so giving it a try in a smoked meat preparation was interesting. This dish is actually quite filling so I only finished half and I noticed this at other tables as well.

Blah!  Texas BBQ, yeah whatever.  Over rated!!!Toronto BBQ, wtf?  Really?   The hardcore pitmasters just rolled over in their grave.  Once again, the Yelp community shows me the light, thank you fellow Yelpaholics.Toronto people, this joint is friggin' awesome.  You do not know how lucky you are.   The dry rub wings are perfect.   The dry rub allows for a crispy skin that snaps off.   The smoked meat is NOT your typical pink smoke chicken meat, its on the whiter side with no smoke aftertaste you find in some joints.  The wings are served in a cast iron skillet, I was literally dipping and scraping for the dry rub that fell to the bottom of the skillet.We ordered the Dry Rub (herb-crusted crunch), Sweet Heat (sticky, sweet, with a little bite) and Barque Rack O' Bama (the classic: rubbed, smoked, basted, basted) Rib Taster.  The Rib Taster is 1/3 rack of each flavor.   The winner goes to Barque Rack O'Bama!!!!  I had to laugh at the name, fitting for Canada, they do love the left.......   The Sweat Heat is great too.  Note ---- the Dry Rub is different than the wing dry rub, it is more of a Jerk.  Just sayn'.   All the baby back ribs are meat fall of the bone good.  We also ordered the Beef Brisket and the Pommery Pull Pork.  The brisket was okay, but I am very critical of brisket and only like it a certain way, it would have rated a 7 out of 10.  Decent, but not to die for.   The Pommery Pulled Pork was excellent, some of the best I have ever had.Sides - Cajun Mac n' Cheese.  The white cheddar is great and the Cajun panko is a nice touch, but I did not taste any Cajun.  Still really good, but like my brisket, I tend to be overly critical of macncheese.   Now the fries --------- YELP TIP ----------  ask your sever to put the same dry rub on the fries as on the wings.  Awesomeness!!!!!  You will thank me later.So I did not post any pictures, but the pictures on here are pretty accurate.  The inside is cramped and loud, but get over it and dig into some killer BBQ.",4.0,5.0,424,2017-06-13,43.64801,-79.449659,"Barbeque , Smokehouse"
Barque Smokehouse,"Barque has the best BBQ experience in Toronto hands down. Chef David Neinstein makes the best dry rub chicken wings and baby back ribs in town.

From the bucket of fresh bbq popcorn to the great selection of wines and beers, Barque is a great place to bring friends, family and large groups. Their service is always great!

Barque Smokehouse,"There's much better BBQ in Toronto. Honestly, this city offers better BBQ in other locations. Enjoyed dinner at Barque yesterday. We (2 of us) sat comfortably at the bar, as we didn't have a reservation, and the place was hopping at 6:30 on a Wednesday night. The bartender was friendly and helpful - so service was all good.The food, on the other hand, is really just ok.If you're really looking for BBQ choices and excellent grub, this isn't the place. We had wings (hot chipotle), brisket, poutine, mac n cheese, and a half rack of ribs. First the good news - the ribs were quite good - although I really don't get the idea of offering up sauces on the side. There are 3 choices of sauce available when you order. It's time to commit. When you eat pasta in an Italian restaurant, they don't bring the sauce options on the side, do they? Anyway, the meat came off the bone just the way it should. And they were nice and tender, not fatty at all. The wings - yich. Gummy, practically uncooked. My fault for not ordering the dusted wings. But really, the wings should still be cooked, regardless of what sauce or spice they're using. Just bad - don't order wings unless you're getting the dusted ones, like the people did next to us. The moment I saw those I realized my mistake. Barque's mistake - offering these wings in their restaurant. Really, anyone can do better at home.The poutine - sure, it was good, not great, but good.Mac n Cheese - well, I've upped my personal game on this, so what I ate last night is just average. You can't take basic mac n cheese, toss some panko on it, and dish it up as anything special. You can do that with KD. Kind of seemed like that.Brisket, somewhat tasty, but fairly dry. Sure, meats can be a little hit and miss, but relying on the squirt bottles of sauce on the counter to boost the flavour and moisture content isn't appropriate. Notable misses on the menu to really be in the BBQ game: Beef ribs, fried chicken, onion rings. As for the bar menu itself - yikes - I have more spirit options at home. Seriously, everyone knows that bourbon and BBQ are synonymous. Well, not here, with just 4 average options to choose from.

Barque Smokehouse,"We came to Barque on a Sunday night and had the set menu which consisted of Arugula Frisée salad, Hilltop Wings, an assortment of pulled pork, beef brisket and ribs followed up with a Coconut cream pie in a jar dessert - $35/ea.There was a $15 corking fee for our wine which was fine, the salad came quickly but was nothing to write home about, a little tart but otherwise fine. The Wings were not to my liking, perhaps it was the spices as I don't believe the chicken wings themselves were an issue. The honey mustard on the side was nice though.This is where things derailed, there was a 40 min delay between the wings and the main course BBQ platter, needless to say we consumed a lot of complimentary popcorn during the wait.When the platter came out, we were all really hungry and dug in, most didn't like the cornbread as it was laced with spices (probably pepper) as they couldn't handle the heat, i thought this was the highlight of the platter along with the corn and loaded potatoes! The brisket was ok as was the pulled pork, nothing special here. However, the ribs were rubbed with typical spices vigorously and looked charred but wasn't really, a couple of bites in and it revealed tough, chewy almost jerky like meat that was far from 'falling off the bone.' I only had one to realize I wasn't interested in having more as it was even difficult to cut with a knife. The portions were enough for us as most of us didn't eat all that much since we didn't enjoy the food but most would be disappointed with the portion size.Many reviewers speak of how much better the BBQ is here over Nashville etc... while I've never been to Nashville, I can say that the BBQ places I've been to in California, New York State and Florida are far superior. Even Smoke Meat Pete's outside of Montreal was better.Well, we tried it, didn't like it and won't be back.The exorbitant fee ($3/ea) for cutting 10 pieces of birthday cake is ridiculous, so we left the cake for home.",4.0,2.0,424,2017-09-05,43.64801,-79.449659,"Barbeque , Smokehouse"

I'm not typically a fan of smoked poultry, but they had a real nice juiciness to it. The beef brisket was also real good as it was just cut, so you still had all that juicy liquid fat coating the meat. For sides, the mashed potatoes were good while the brussel sprouts were a bit too salty, but doesn't detract from the overall meal.It's pretty hard to find good BBQ in the GTA so it's nice to find some going down Toronto. The place itself is located off the beaten path of the downtown core, but was well worth a trip. Will definitely be back",4.0,4.0,424,2017-02-21,43.64801,-79.449659,"Barbeque , Smokehouse"
Barque Smokehouse,"Was downtown on biz & was looking for some BBQ. Saw this local shop and decided to stop in.I ordered the Beef Brisket sandwich with a side of coleslaw. The sandwich was sparsely populated with beef and I found it to be really fatty. Somuch so that I had to stop & cut off the extra fat. I'm happy that I asked for the coleslaw to be served off-sandwich, wasn't a fan of that flavour. The side coleslaw that I ordered was tasty but only mildly.

Wallflower,"I love the Wallflower.My dining companion used to live in the area, so we often found ourselves showing up for just a quick drink or even a full-fledged meal. The dark, inviting ambiance works for just about any scenario, and I will admit I've missed the place since my aforementioned friend moved away.We decided to make our triumphant return a few nights ago and it was as though we'd never left. We even managed to secure our usual table near the door.Before we even got there, we both knew that one thing we had to order was the deviled eggs. These are standard deviled eggs with an always-changing roster of toppings. (On this particular night, the eggs were topped with cumin and another spice I'm forgetting.) Though they're not prepared to order - these clearly came out of a fridge - the eggs are perfectly cooked and the center is deliciously creamy. A must.I was also excited to order the Snack Nachos, as it's an item that pretty much became a staple for me during my many previous visits. It was saddening, then, to discover that the dish has grown considerably worse in the last few months (or perhaps the chef was having an off night). What was once an ooey, gooey mess of cheesy nachos has turned into a lazy, phoned-in dish that leaves way too many nachos without any cheese. (Nothing worse than a naked nacho, in my opinion.) I'll probably give this one another shot on a future visit, but I was definitely quite disappointed.We also decided to try one of their specials, a Brisket Stew. Despite the fact that it was really more of a soup than a stew, we quite enjoyed this dish. It's got a deep, delicious flavor that's heightened by an assortment of tasty ingredients, including a very generous serving of soft, tender brisket and a good helping of bread (which is perfect for sopping up the rich sauce).I should also point out that the service was, as always, excellent. I had a question about one of the beers on tap, and the waitress offered to bring me a small glass to try.

Wallflower,"Wallflower is a neighbourhood gem. If you're in the area and have some time to grab a drink or have a bite, then I definitely recommend making a pit stop at this lovely bar. The service is always great! The staff is incredibly helpful and very outgoing. This place is amazing for drinks. Let's just say, it's very refreshing to go here after seeing the absurd pricing Queen and Dundas West have to offer.I'm the biggest fan of their grilled cheese plate. It's so so so yummy! Although I know that grilled cheese is something you can easily make at home, I assure you that this is the best grilled cheese I've ever had and it's only seven bucks! What?! This wonderful plate comes with potato wedges and kale slaw. My go-to snacks are usually that and their devilled eggs. You can not go wrong with either. Just a heads-up; my partner usually orders from their list of specials and has said that sometimes it can be a hit or miss.They have a stunning outdoor patio that you can enjoy during the summertime. However, once it starts getting chilly out, you'll definitely feel cozy inside with their super charming decor. Try it out!",4.0,4.0,35,2017-11-04,43.649926,-79.436898,"Canadian (New) , Bars"

Wallflower,"Toronto's back patios: friend and foe. Friend because duh, patio. Foe because it seems impossible to know where they all are, particularly in the hour of need. Yes, it is possible to absolutely need a cocktail on a patio on a hot day. I know because I checked. With myself. Many of Toronto's patios are hidden from sight to those just walking by, sometimes even hidden to those inside the restaurant. But oh man, learning a place you already love also has a patio is like getting a free garlic dip for your pizza: it makes a good thing even better. This was my experience with Wallflower. I have lived in the neighbourhood and visited a number of times over the years, but never knew it had a back patio. This is largely because the entrance to the patio requires you to go through the first room of the restaurant, down the stairs, past the bathroom, and back up the stairs out the back door. Not exactly intuitive. But definitely adds to the feeling like you are in on a special secret. The back patio is just as chilled out and comfortable as Wallflower's interior, and has a way of making you feel like you are completely separated from the noise of the city even though it is only a few steps away. Wallflower's selection of dishes, all of which fit into the category of what I would call comfort food - devilled eggs, gnocchi, and a simple green salad are my frequent selections - fit the outdoor setting just as well as the indoor one. Maybe don't order the potato wedges AND the gnocchi unless you want to roll yourself home/go into a potato starch related coma. Or maybe just plan a trip to a coffee shop post-meal since Wallflower doesn't have coffee on site.",4.0,5.0,35,2016-08-06,43.649926,-79.436898,"Canadian (New) , Bars"

I really enjoyed their incredibly buttery and thick grilled cheese and seafood soup. My partner had their caesar salad and deviled eggs and they were delicious, too (I heavily poison-tested them.

Wallflower,"Gotta love the local watering hole for residents of Parkdale along Dundas. Came here for drinks this evening an much like my CM pals from near and far I fell in love with this tiny dive bar spot. You enter into a small bar room but little do you know, much like Alice's rabbit hole, the Wallflower goes deeper and deeper (and becomes more and more curious). Walking down and then up a few steps you're welcomed into what looks like the main room area with the walls adorned with mustached portraits - (lets call this the dictator room). While I didn't sit here you can tell this space can hold a fair number of people. The fun didn't end here however, walks g down a full flight of stairs between the two rooms, leads you to the bathroom and those in the know, know to walk up a far flight of stirs which leads them to the cutest most unknown Neighbourhood patio I've ever seen. Built like a deck at your best friends house, the Christmas lights providing visibility mixed with the high wooden walls make this a come little spot. Pro-tip it closes at 10pm on most weekdays.Aside from the lack of name above the door what I really enjoyed here was their unique take on a Pimms cup; made with Pimms No. 1 and bourbon! Yumm. Filled with ice, cucumbers and an orange slice it was refreshing and boozy enough to make you woozy! Hooray! And for $9 taxes in, I'd say that's a better than fair price for a great cocktail like this. Great quiet place to grab a drink, and while I didn't have anything to eat here, the food looked pretty damn good to.

We entered the lounge and we're not greeted, however we were stared at by the bartender and we kept looking back waiting for service of any sort. A nice couple offered us their table which was extremely nice, but not necessary and should've been taken care of by the staff and not the guests. Once we did get service, however, our night was really looking up. Our server was a really pleasant and relaxed young lady who gave us cute hand made menus which go with the overall cozy decor of the place. They had plenty of craft beer on tap and several more in can/bottle and they ranged at about $6~$8. We also got snack size nachos with pulled pork and hot peppers for only $10 and they were delicious. Also one of the best Ceasars around, tasted like a nice salad ;) makes me feel like I'm drinking healthy LOL.Overall, very nice and cozy!!

The food- they always have a wide variety of features which allows for trying different dishes every time you visit.

Lots of stained glass windows, high ceilings, vintage flower wallpaper, and a bar lit with strung Christmas lights. So cute and quaint. Perfect date spot. Just one bartender tonight, she brought us our menus right away. There were three other couples in the bar and one person at the wood. The wine list was written on a piece of cardboard which I thought was fun. There were two Malbecs on the list so I was sold. Jordan had a No. 9 on tap. We decided to indulge in their $2 oysters.

Honest Weight,"my favorite of all the meals we had on a short weekend trip to toronto recently. you MUST love seafood if you come here, there's just no way to avoid it because there is seafood in literally every single thing on the menu.good thing bf and i are huge seafood fanatics. we ordered oysters, pick yer fish, and gulf shrimp. literally everything was delicious, potentially because copious amounts of butter was used (mmmmmmm). each dish was completely satisfying, but if i had to pick one as my favorite, i'd have to go with the gulf shrimp. very rarely do i get the joy of eating such plump shrimp that are this big in size. you know it's big when you can easily use a fork and knife to peel the shrimp, rather than using your own fingers. it can be really easy to slightly overcook jumbo sized shrimp, but these were perfect. peel, dip it in lotsa buttah, put in mouth, make stomach happy, and all is right in the world. repeat until all shrimp are gone.the pick yer fish is a close second. there were something like 5 choices that day and i don't think we could've gone wrong with any of them. trying to be adventurous, we chose a fish that we had never heard of before (unfortunately don't remember the name) - it turned out to be a flaky white fish which is perfect for this type of grilled filet cooking. the grilled veggies and potato also add to the overall flavor of the dish and each bite.and what can i say about oysters? oysters are oysters - you either love 'em or hate 'em. and we love them! the two types we tried that day were both on the bigger side with a balanced and clean finish.very intimate but low key setting. excellent service from simply some of the friendliest people around. highly recommended!",4.0,5.0,69,2017-10-12,43.665334,-79.461486,"Seafood , Seafood Markets"

Honest Weight,"We ordered a Fish Sandwich, a Crab Legs Cluster, and a Clam Chowder to share.  The Fish Sandwich was excellent.  The texture of the bread felt like a dense croissant. The skin of the bread had a light crunch.  The inside was soft and airy.  The bread tasted very good, too.  The fish fillet used fish of the day, which was rock fish for my order.  The fillet was fresh, tasty and moist.  The toppings and the sauce were outstanding.  The vinegary slaw that came along was a star on its own.  The flavour hit a good balance of sourness and sweetness.  It was a great balance to the buttery bread.  All the parts together made an awesome sandwich.  The portion was adequate as a lunch for one.  It was fairly priced at $15 per portion, quality of ingredients and culinary skills.  The Crab Legs Cluster was very fresh and a great deal to boot.  It was steam cooked just right and presented beautifully on a bed of ice.  The portion was generous for $18 compared to many Canadian restaurants.  If you don't have easy access to live seafood, I recommend ordering the crab legs cluster.  If you do, and you are comfortable with steaming shellfish, this dish is not difficult to cook at home.The Clam Chowder was creamy and delicious.  Yet we were disappointed that it was mostly cream with 5 to 6 pieces of clams.  At $12, we found it over-priced.While we placed our name on the waitlist for table, I noticed that there were a few empty tables.  The two waitresses were busy handling food orders.  They didn't clean the tables to move the line for at least 15 minutes.  I think the slow turnover contributes partly to the long wait.  After we had an opportunity to browse the menu, we had to attempt a few times to wave down a waitress to place orders.  The fish sandwich and the crab legs are worthy of 5 stars.  The clam chowder and the slow services brought the rating down a bit. The overall rating is 4 stars.",4.0,4.0,69,2017-05-06,43.665334,-79.461486,"Seafood , Seafood Markets"

Honest Weight,"I love Honest Weight. It's a cosy, unpretentious place to get great seafood. Came on a Friday evening around 6 pm and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away. There's limited seating and we weren't sure if we would have to wait (they don't take reservations). Service was pleasant but not overbearing.We started off with a sea bream crudo - dressed only with olive oil, flecks of sea salt and finely chopped fresh herbs. Simple, yet delicious.We got the okonomiyaki of the day, made with Ontario rainbow trout and Icelandic cod. It was extremely hearty and filling - unlike other okonomiyaki I've had, it's chock full of fish, shredded cabbage and yam, with just enough batter to hold it all together. It was dressed with kewpie mayo and bonito flakes, which gave the dish a wonderful umami flavour. Since Honest Weight is a fish shop, there are a variety of fish available for purchase, and they also have a ""pick your fish"" menu option, where you select any fish to be cooked and served to you. We opted for John Dory from New Zealand. It was perfectly seared and served atop a bed of rapini and smashed potatoes. For dessert, we ordered some kind of vanilla cake pudding baked with maple syrup and served with a side of chantilly cream. It's mildly reminiscent of the maple pudding chômeur that's served at Au Pied de Cochon. Sweet, but not overly so. A nice end to a great meal. I think the portion size is quite reasonable and food is priced well. I wish it wasn't so far out of the way for me, or I'd come back more often.

Pick of the day fishes were all good.  I had the delicate turbot and my friends had the perch.  All cooked with skill and served with a tasty vegetable hash beneath.  We finished with amazing homemade strawberry shortcake.  Service was attentive and knowledgeable and we lacked for nothing.",4.0,5.0,69,2017-09-24,43.665334,-79.461486,"Seafood , Seafood Markets"

We went after a long sunny day in high park.I had seafood chowder and a fish sandwich and my partner had bouillabaisse. The bun was perfect for the sandwich- soft and chewy w great aioli, fresh good quality lettuce and the fish for that day was rockfish. It would be more than sufficient for lunch. With rich chowder it made a perfect dinner. The bouillabaisse was flavourful and rich with a huge variety of shellfish and fish. As a nice touch, the bluefish in the bouillabaisse was pan fried crispy (in a tiny bit of cornmeal maybe?) before it was placed in the soup.Service was excellent and music and environment was great.

Honest Weight,"I have heard about Honest Weight from multiple sources, in particular from a waiter at Chase. I knew that Honest Weight supplied seafood to a plethora of fine restaurants in the city so we had to check it out. The restaurant was very cozy upon stepping inside. Weirdly, the menu was written on cute little  green chalkboards at the back of the restaurant as the majority of the menu changes frequently based on their seafood availability. We ordered the fish sandwich and scallop mousseline at the bar then got seated. The fish sandwich made with the fish of the day, rockfish, was delicious and paired perfectly with the housemade dill aioli on a crispy bun and a side of coleslaw. It was seasoned very well. MMmmMMmmMmm :) The scallop mousseline looked like beautiful food art and was tasty as well. However, my partner ate the entire dish in two bites. For 16 dollars, we expected it to be bigger than 2 inches in diameter from the description. It reminded us of dishes at Alo which my partner believes does not fit with the theme of Honest Weight.Overall, Honest Weight is a fun and non-pretentious place to go for good seafood. The only downside is that the dishes were overpriced. Fish sandwiches at the Fish Store in College are just as good but are almost half the price. That being said, Honest Weight is a great concept and is worth checking out!",4.0,3.0,69,2016-11-25,43.665334,-79.461486,"Seafood , Seafood Markets"
Honest Weight,"Super pretentious with horrible service. Came by with 3 friends on a cold and rainy day and was told that the wait would be about 45 mins long. We asked if we could sit by the bar and have a drink while we wait, only to be told that it's not an option, even though there was free stool seating right by the bar and entrance area. As we were trying to figure out where to go and grab a drink, while we wait for the table, we were pretty much told to leave and not stand in the high traffic area. Who kicks their customers out of a restaurant on a rainy day? What high traffic area? It's a tiny little restaurant with absolutely no traffic. Just horrible. I have never  experienced this level of rudeness in a restaurant. We walked over to Nodo and had a wonderful dinner with amazing service.  We are so glad we didn't wait for the table because we received the call 2.5 hours after instead of 45 mins. Very disorganized. This is just hype and with this kind to  service,  I can't imagine why anyone would want to go there.

I've been a vegetarian my whole life and I'm used to not having a lot of options, but there was so much selection at Planta and it was all delicious. I've been several times. My favourite appetizer is easily the cauliflower tots. They are amazing every time! Entree-wise, I've tried the burger, the crab cakes, and the lasagna. The crab cakes were my favourite and the lasagna is a close second. Nothing wrong with the burger at all! I've had so many vegan and vegetarian burgers that it wasn't anything to write home about. The crab cakes on the other hand, were full of flavor and something I've never experienced before. The staff here are always crazy helpful and knowledgeable. If it weren't so pricey I'd be eating here every night. It's worth the price though, for this level and quality of vegan food. This isn't something that's easy to find.

They have chairs that are hung from the ceiling! So cool. Their menu is really diverse, from burgers to vegan hot dogs to curries. It is more on the pricey side, I couldn't spot anything less then 15$. But there are alot of options, definitely something for everyone. I got the planta burger and it was really good. I have no idea what the burger was made of but it was more on the soft side, usually I have a preference to crispier burgers, but this was delicious nevertheless. The meal also came with fries and oh man were they yummy. They were sprinkled with a spice which made each bite of the crispy fries potatoes even more yum. It came with a side of ranch for dipping. Altogether it was about $20, which I found was overpriced for the amount of food, (the burger is small as my palm). The service was great, everyone was nice and attentive to get me what I wanted.

Planta,"Planta is a vegan establishment conveniently located in the Yorkville area and has been on my bookmark list for a while now. Having seen so many pictures of Planta's interior, I knew what to expect going in - rose gold cutlery, white tiled walls, and green accents courtesy of the plants around the restaurant. It's an instagrammer's dream for sure! The drink menu here is quite extensive. I was tempted to order the Pistachio Rose Milk, but I settled for Aloe Views, which is Planta's take on the Moscow Mule. It was quite a strong drink with a stronger ginger flavour. My friend and I had the Cauliflower Tots to share. From the Yelp reviews, it seems like this is a must-try dish - and I can definitely see why! The tots had a thin, crispy skin and a soft, creamy interior, similar to that of mashed potatoes. The taste was also superb, and it was hard to believe that this dish is vegan. My only complaint was that they can get a bit oily towards the end.For my main, I ordered the Harvest salad. While the serving size was generous, I did not feel like this salad warranted the $15 price tag, especially when there was not much protein. I also felt that they added too much dressing, making the salad too acidic to ingest towards the end. Definitely ask to get your dressing on the side!I would come back to try some of their other main dishes, but would probably steer away from the salad menu.",4.0,4.0,215,2017-12-26,43.670215,-79.389434,"Tapas/Small Plates , Pizza , Cocktail Bars"
Planta,"4.5I love Planta!! So I've heard a lot of hype around it, and decided to venture out one cold snowy day and was not disappointed. Firstly I like how courteous the staff are in accommodating you requests. Was going to be a bit late but they happily pushed the reservation to a later time despite the restaurant being very busy. Though a small interior, Planta boasts soaring ceilings and amazing decor. The ambience definitely makes the trip worth it if it's a distance for you. Went with a couple of friends and we decided to split a couple of items, a Bianca pizza, coconut ceviche and truffle fries. The portion sizing of the fries was quite large...the ceviche was more small plates/tapas style but it was AMAZING. Pricey but so incredibly good - the flavours were unlike anything I've tasted before and it was even more cool that the dish was vegan and made from coconut. The pizza was also good. Standard veggies but what really got me was the fact that the cheese was made from cashews and tasted so real! Definitely want to try a Planta burger next time because those looked awesome. The restaurant is on the pricey side, but definitely a nice spot to visit. The service was also great and they easily split the bill anyway you'd like.

Planta,"Who knew vegan food could taste so delicious?! Of course, in the upscale Yorkville, you can't avoid expensive, but it was definitely worth it. The interior is gorgeous. Very bright and tropical feely in my opinion. And the rose gold! Rose gold chairs, rose gold cutlery, and even rose gold door handles!I was here for a work lunch and we decided to get a variety of apps to share. The truffle fries were tasty, the kimchi spring rolls were nice and crisp, we had brussel sprouts and I typically do not like brussel sprouts but they were delicious, but my absolute favourite would have to be the cauliflower tots. These yummy things were a bite of heaven!I ordered ""crab cakes"" as a main. It didn't have a crabby taste, but it was still really good. My coworkers let me sample their food as well. The eggplant lasagna is a good choice as it had a deep smokey flavour you wouldn't expect. My overall recommendation if you want to guarantee the best meal is the truffle mac and cheese. Every bite felt like I died, went to heaven, fell back to earth and do it all over again. It was so so darn good! To end things off, we had dessert and oh my their portions were large. I had the chocolate brownie and it was so rich and creamy -- I really don't know how they do it. My coworkers got the chocolate terrarium which had really cute presentation, replicating a terrarium. My other coworker was feeling adventurous and decided to go with the lime cheesecake. All great choices though I would probably go with the chocolate brownie as a winner.Thanks Planta for showing people that vegan can be fancy!",4.0,5.0,215,2018-01-09,43.670215,-79.389434,"Tapas/Small Plates , Pizza , Cocktail Bars"
Planta,"As I have been eating a mostly vegan/veggie/sometimes seafood diet for the last while, I had wanted to check out Planta for a long time. I was super excited when one of my girlfriends suggested it for brunch for our girls weekend in early December.We all opted to get a shot (not alcohol but juice lol) to begin our meals. Since it was a girls weekend, we had been drinking a fair amount and I also was recovering from a nasty bout of food poisoning so we needed all of the extra nutrients we could get.I selected the veggie burger for my main, the girls chose banana pancakes and the smoked ""salmon"" (aka carrots) respectively. The girls said they enjoyed their meals and my burger was just a-ok. I wished they had real dill pickles on the burger to add some salt and crunch.At the end of the meal, I went upstairs to use the restroom and noticed how dirty the restaurant was. The bathroom was pretty gross and I also saw lots of food bits all over the dining room floor. Was a bit surprised of the state of the restaurant given the space itself (it is just as pretty as you see on Instagram in terms of decor).All in all, I would return to try another dish or two but would not rush back.",4.0,3.0,215,2018-01-04,43.670215,-79.389434,"Tapas/Small Plates , Pizza , Cocktail Bars"

Dusted. Peanuts (I kid you not). The slightly tart, slightly sweet bits of raspberry add a less sweet, but just as delicious note so that the entire shebang isn't overwhelmingly sweet and rich as it sounds. What preceded this wonder? I couldn't pass another go at the cauliflower tots (so delicious) and I tried a different pizza (as much as I wanted the Frenchie again), the Italian Job.

Some regular stuff that's good, but not at all worth the price - like cauliflower tots, tacos, and veggie burger. And you do need to accept Yorkville prices - the cheese plate, for example, is creative and tasty, but super tiny and like $25. And we blew through almost $400 as a table of four. The service was also impressively bad (but I know that depends on who you get). Slow. Didn't let us know they had specials. Didn't let us know there were menu changes. Never came back for refill drink orders etc.But it's a great space, with really high quality food, and some really well thought out dishes.

We shall see! The location is absolutely gorgeous. All angles scream 'Instagram this!' I'm glad we made reservations, this place is busy! My friend had heard how good the Planta Burger and their Truffle Fries were, so that was a no brainer. Myself, having a deep seeded love for pizza and carbs, chose the Italian Job.  We split the burger and pizza...obviously. The burger was HUGE and amazing. It was a black bean burger with all of the toppings a burger should have: mushroom bacon, queso, tomatillo ketchup and pickles. Wow. As a meat eater, I was impressed. It was juicy, tasty and so very filling. The seasoning was on point. The hype about Truffle Fries was true! A little messy, but so worth it. You'll be glad you got them. The pizza was not as good. A little soggy from toppings, but the toppings didn't save it. Not as much flavour as I'd hoped; I'd try a different pizza next time. Did we get dessert? Damn right we did. I had the Banana Split and she had the Brownie with Ice Cream. Even though we were stuffed, we couldn't NOT get dessert. The Banana Split was exploding with fruit flavours. The vanilla ice cream was coconut, the strawberry was actual strawberry puree and, if I didn't know this wasn't real ice cream, the chocolate would've fooled me. If you think the Brownie is huge by the picture, it IS. My friend could barely get through half of it. It was rich and heavy; I recommend sharing this one! Service was fantastic.

Nodo,"It's not No-do, it's yes-do. Or whatever the kids say. So I may be a little bit biased because I was craving pasta but, I had a fantastic experience here. As we sat down, we were served chickpea like bean things which helped satiate our hunger and then a bread basket and olive oil which was okay but not outstanding. Not entirely throwing all caution to the wind and embracing TGIF, the four of us decided to forego appetizers for the sake of our waistlines and ordered individual plates of pasta for our mains instead. Two of us ordered the brome lake pappardelle, one the Adriatico linguine and the last the Rapini Salsiccia Orecchiette. If I were to rate in order of best to last, it would be in this order: 1. Pappardelle - the noodles were fresh and cooked to absolute perfection. A perfect balance of rich duck and tart tomato, this was probably our favorite pasta of the four. I could literally eat these noodles non-stop. The only slight miss was the crispy sage which I felt there wasn't enough of. 2. Orecchiette - Again, this dish was executed well but, the reason it takes second place is how heavy it was. The noodles weren't quite as fresh as the pappardelle but the flavor was fantastic. While it took a bit of effort to get through because of how rich it was, the sausage combined with the garlic and cheese was fantastic. 3. Linguine - This pasta was good but definitely not standout. There was a good amount of seafood and the noodles were cooked well but it lacked the pizazz and finesse of the first two. Good, but not something I would go back for. Now, I know I said we would play it safe for the sake of our waistlines, but after the delicious pastas we just couldn't resist dessert. Between the four of us, we shared the chocolate torte, caramel bread pudding and tiramisu. The tiramisu was the absolute best and IMO the second the chocolate torte and then the bread pudding. The alcohol and cream balance in the tiramisu was perfect but the chocolate torte was just missing something. Don't get me wrong, it was still good but not great (although the accompanying gelato was PERFECT). The bread pudding wasn't as decadent as we had hoped it to be and ended up last on our list. Overall the experience was good. I would definitely come back for the pappardelle and would love to come back to try the pizza.

Nodo,"Been going here since it opened and it used to be great; however, the service/food quality over the last year has diminished significantly. I noticed this particularly since there has been a new floor manager (a plumper man in his 40s). The skinnier manager has always been beyond polite and hospitable. This other manager is not the friendliest and does not treat regulars well.A particular incident happened recently where my husband and I were there with another couple. My husband's main course had been missed/something happened in the kitchen and he didn't receive his main course until after everyone else had finished theirs. The waiter basically acted as it was an oops moment and for us to just deal with it. I have never been at a restaurant where the waiter/manager didn't sincerely apologize or offer a round of drinks/complimentary dessert when something like this happens. We are PAYING, not to mention REGULAR, clientele. Not impressed, Nodo. Better to go to Campo on Jane st. A lot smaller, and they are less considered with getting you in and out and the food & services is A+ quality.",4.0,1.0,137,2018-01-04,43.665338,-79.465662,Italian
Nodo,"I've been here twice so far. Once with a big group on a Saturday and once with some girlfriends during the week. They don't take reservations so it's best to show up either early 6:30ish or late 9:45ish. They do however, take your name and number and give you a call when your table is ready. On Saturday we waited for about an hour after showing up at 8pm and on Wednesday we showed up at 7pm and got a table right away. The service here is excellent!!! They are very attentive, polite, responsive and they aren't the least bit rude (even when you ask to do annoying things, like 3-way share a salad, or package up leftovers). The food is also excellent. The calamari is to die for. The Caesar salad is really good...not all creamy like some places. The meat and cheese board is also amazing and it's a must if you go with enough people. I had the pasta with breaded cauliflower and it was so so so good. It tasted even better the next day as leftovers. For dessert we had the tiramisu and the trio of gelato (vanilla, chocolate and pistachio) all super yummy. I'm preggo right now so I can't speak to the wine, but they do have a wide selection including some reasonably priced options. In addition, the restaurant is decorated very nicely with some antique pieces and the washrooms are super clean and have the smallest, cutest sinks I've ever seen. This is definitely a Junction favourite and they even have a private room for larger parties. I can't imagine bringing anyone here and not having them rave about the place. It's an amazing restaurant.",4.0,5.0,137,2017-03-17,43.665338,-79.465662,Italian

The portions were more than generous and the taste of the food was perfect. Not over seasoned, just the right amount of salt. My in laws had pasta dishes and they were very happy with their dishes as well. I will definitely be coming back. It was a bit loud, but they allowed us to close the door downstairs - it made for a nice quiet evening, good company, great food! come to the Junction and try out this restaurant!

Nodo,Overall the food and drinks were delightful. The Crispy artichokes and the modern Gnocchi were tasty and well made. My mojito was unique and balanced with the chamomile grappa. Prices were fair too! Decor was cute with a cozy modern twist. Food runners were also courteous. Reason for the 2 stars is because the service makes me not want to return. Our cocktails arrived well after our appetizers. Our Server was not personable and very cookie cutter. He checked in with us on our Entree once then disappeared for 45 minutes passing us by countless times. Dirty dishes sat on our table for a long time and when he finally dropped off the dessert menu we already lost our appetite. Then we had to wait another 10 minutes for our check *sigh*Dining out is supposed be enjoyable and not make you feel annoyed and ignored.

Nodo,"Arrived at around 7:30pm on a Thursday with some friends and waited for about 5 minutes to be seated. I don't eat Italian very often but I'm glad that one of my girlfriends picked this place to try out. We ordered the rice ball and fried calamari for starters. Though they were both good I did have much higher expectations from the hyped up reviews. For our main, we ordered pizza, the new school gnocchi and the trinacria rigatoni. My friends and I agreed that the pasta was the best out of everything we ordered. The rigatoni is light made with a lot of fresh vegetables, a great summer pasta. The new school gnocchi was my favourite, it was pan fried and cooked perfectly through, though the portion leaned toward the smaller side. We ended off with the Tiramisu which was good as well. As for the service, they were friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back to try their other dishes!",4.0,4.0,137,2017-05-25,43.665338,-79.465662,Italian
Nodo,"I had been eyeing this place for some time now when I finally decided to give it a try for Hubby's and I birthday dinner.We came in on a Friday night a bit after 7pm and the place was packed. FYI they don't take reservations. We were kindly welcomed in by a host who informed us it would be a 20 minute wait but we could have a seat at the bar which offers the full service dinner menu and the waiter would grab us when our table was ready. We decided to wait it out on the bench by the front as we watched more and more patrons come in. 20 minutes later true to his word our table was ready and the wait time had increased to 40+ minutes.We were led through the dim lit restaurant to the last table against the communal tufted black leather banquet that ran along both lengths of the restaurants. I particularly liked this table as it felt much more intimate as there was no one seated to the left of us and we had great views of the bar, kitchen, and entire restaurant. Our bubbly and friendly waitress came over to greet us and went over the entire menu with us and was super informative giving us honest opinions and helping us choose between dishes.We started the night with some crisp and refreshing pinot grigio that came served in a funky jug with a rooster on it. We were then brought over some complimentary bread with olive oil and lupini beans - which our waitress described to us as the Italian version of edamame.To begin our meal we shared a salad.Rucola E Fungi - Organic baby arugula, wild mushroom, goat cheese, toasted walnut, diced radish, lemon-balsamic vinaigretteVery fresh tasting, I enjoyed the tangy dressing against the spicy arugula with the creamy goat cheese and crunchy toasted nutsFor our mains we decided to share two entrees and a sideRigatoni Bolognese - Slow cooked veal, pork, beef ragu, reggianoVery large portion of pasta cooked to a perfect al dente. My only complaint was the lack of meat. I was expecting a rich chunky meat sauce but there was only a few crumbles of meat through out the huge bowl of pasta which was mainly coated in the san Marzano tomato sauce which was still delicious.Lamb Costolette D'Agnello - Fire-grilled, marinated lamb chops, rainbow beets, roasted brussels, garlic rapini, rustic herb potato, nebbiolo-demiCooked to a perfect medium rare the lamb was so succulent and flavourful! Again another large portion, 4 chops sitting on a bed crushed potatoes and a gorgeous array of winter vegetables. It was definitely the highlight of our meal.Blackened Brussels, shallot, maple-ciderI adore brussel sprouts and always have to order them whenever I see them on the menu. These were particularly good with a yummy sweet and tangy glaze lightly blackened and with still a bit of crunch to them - I ate every last one!I was super stuffed by the time we finished our mains but who am I to ever refuse dessert especially when it's your birthday!Chocolate Torta Cioccolata - Warm Flourless chocolate torte, artisan vanilla gelato, white-honey, crushed nutsI'm a sucker for a warm chocolate cake especially when paired with gelato. What I really liked about this cake was it was more of a dark chocolate flavour and leaning towards the bitter side of chocolate which was great after all that rich food and it really complimented the sweet and creamy vanilla bean gelato. I scraped every last bit of my dessert off the plate.Tiramisu - Classic Italian tiramisu made with fresh mascarponeHubby loves tiramisu so he had to order this. Of course I got to snag a couple large mouthfuls and it was also to die for! Just the perfect take on this popular Italian classic.I can truly see why this place is soo packed the service here is just amazing. Our waitress was soo warm and friendly - she surprised us with candles in our desserts and all the waiters wished us a happy birthday as we were leaving. The food came out in perfect timing with wonderful flavours and hearty portions, and the ambiance here makes you not want to leave. One downside to this place is that the tables are pretty tiny and it was circus trying to juggle all the huge plates of food. The servers were really great at clearing plates when you were done and trying their best to make everything fit. We were lucky we had no one beside us as we were able to stretch out and have more space. It's definitely worth checking out but make sure you stay away from the centre tables along the banquet as they are really squished together.",4.0,4.0,137,2016-04-25,43.665338,-79.465662,Italian

Nodo,"NodoNo, do go to this place. It's good.Our party of 6 dined at Nodo on a Monday night and it was a very enjoyable experience. We will be going back to try it again the next time we are in The Junction!Nodo was a recommendation from a friend of a friend and I did little of my own review before dining so I was really going into this one blind. We were seated at the entrance of the restaurant which could have been very uncomfortable with strong winds outside, however, there was a heavy curtain preventing most of the wind from chilling us during our meal. That's a good start! Our waitress was excellent. She was very friendly and helpful (took time to explain the multitude of questions we had) and her service was prompt. We each ordered a starter and a main and shared two desserts, all which were excellent. The tastes were distinct and bright like Italian cuisine should be, however, next time we will order fewer starters as the portions were larger than we anticipated. The menu includes all of the traditional Italian categories (Assaggina, Insalate, Antipasti, Pizza, Pasta, etc.) which was a little overwhelming to some of our party but for someone who is more-or-less familiar with that format, all of my favourites were available. The highlight for me was the crispy, fried shrimp and calamari plate. It was well-seasoned, fried perfectly, and great for sharing. All plating was simple and elegant.The ambiance was very enjoyable. There were interesting fixtures and pieces of art which caught our eyes at various points in the night and the high ceilings created a perfect noise level for having a group conversation. I felt as though the food prices were very fair for the quality, variety and taste. We did not order wine but the list looked sizable. Next time I will request a table closer to the back of the restaurant as the vibe seemed cozier towards the kitchen.THE GOODDelicious food that reminds you of Nonna's cooking. Cliché but it's true.

Nodo,"Slightly above average Italian restaurant. The food was alright and service was nothing special. Slightly overpriced for what you get.Went here on a Saturday night and the place was quite busy. We had a reservation, so we were fine with getting a table. I got the rice balls as an appetizer to start and then had pizza for dinner (can't recall the name, but it was a chef's special with pear, walnuts and honey on it). Rice balls - $9 for two rice balls. They were really cheesy and not very ricey. It tasted really good, but so is everyone covered in cheese and then deep fried. Pizza - just over $20. The pizza was pretty good. The dough was nice and fluffy and the presentation of it was great. The pizza itself is quite sweet, but that's because of all the honey. It's almost more of a desert pizza. Good for ordering in a big group and everyone having a slice of two of it. Service - I'm not sure if they were understaffed or what, but everything took so long. From sit down to leaving, we were there for about 2 hours. And that was not because we were taking our time. I think it took about 30 minutes just to put our order in. Overall, with the app, pizza and wine, total bill was about $50 including tax and tip. I don't think I would come back and if I was ever in the area I would opt to try out something else. But if nothing is available, this isn't a terrible choice.",4.0,3.0,137,2017-03-12,43.665338,-79.465662,Italian
Nodo,"This is quickly becoming my go-to spot to whisk away visiting friends into a quieter part of town (the Junction) and pretty much guarantee their satisfaction. With handmade noodles and the sound of Italian conversation wafting through the air (oh, and the smell of delicious food, too), Nodo delivers a truly authentic Italian experience that's a true crowd-pleaser.The decor is a charming mix between your grandmother's hundred-year-old home and your chicest friend's dining room. Seriously, whoever designed this place has an unparalleled eye for mixing styles into literal perfection. As for the food, it's unbeatable. My friends have had the calzone and have exploded from joy in front of me. Others have had meat-based pasta dishes and have actually imploded from sheer happiness with life. A vegetarian/vegan might have trouble with really authentic Italian places in general. At least from my experience, the most exciting dishes generally feature meat or seafood. However! Do not fear. Even their simple meals I have devoured with great joy - and by joy I mean several, ""Oh my god,"" and, ""I need five more servings of this."" I ordered their most minimalist pasta dish - I think their pomodoro? - and I adored it. I dream about it at night, and when I open my pantry to nothing but Life cereal and peanut butter. If your time in TO is limited, I highly suggest making the trip out to the Junction for this place alone.

Nodo,"I went for an early dinner on a weekday. The interior looks like a nice Parisian restaurant but it was cute nonetheless! The calamari is SUPERB (though on the salty side), but that was the only good dish out of everything else we ate. The bread before the appetizer was ok but the green olive oil tasted like watered down canola oil.. t'was strange. My friend and I ordered the orecchiette and pappardelle and it was salty. The portion was great and the ingredients were fresh (especially the pasta) but the orecchiette tasted like raw garlic and salt! My duck ragu was super tender and tasty but was ALSO overly seasoned. I'd have understood if it was Spanish restaurant but even then, it was too salty. Maybe the pizzas are better.",4.0,3.0,137,2017-01-19,43.665338,-79.465662,Italian
Nodo,I  didn't really enjoy my experience here. We were in a large party close to the holidays and it was slammed. It took forever to get drinks (30 minutes ) and we only had 2 menus for 8 people. Each person had to pass the menu to decide. Our appetizers took 30 minutes and our mains came 45 minutes later. We had a child with us and she was just so hungry and cranky by the time the apps came. The food was okay. The risotto balls are good and my pizza was fine but I was so frustrated I just wanted to leave. The music is too loud and the ambience lighting too dark. Far too trendy and under staffed for me.,4.0,2.0,137,2016-12-20,43.665338,-79.465662,Italian
The Carbon Bar,"I've been to The Carbon Bar many times. I love the high ceilings and vibe. I am usually there for drinks (love the black mamba margarita) and the Korean Fried Cauliflower is the best in the city. This city loves it's brunch and The Carbon Bar recently joined the Brunch Wagon. I went there a few weeks ago and was throughly impressed. My friend and I had no problems getting a table, we sat down and obviously ordered some caffeine. The coffee is nothing special, tastes like a regular drip coffee. We then proceeded to order; Huevos El Carbon, Smoked Brisket Benny, Smashed & Fried Potatoes, and the Buttermilk Pancakes. The server told us they ran out of the Brisket for the Benny but they could add Pulled Pork, I had zero problems with that as I prefer Pulled Pork over Brisket. About 20 minutes later and all of our food arrived. WOW. It was a LOT of food. We were excited to dig in. I took one bite of my Pulled Pork Benny and fell in love. This had to be the best Eggs Benny I had ever had. It reminded me of a pulled pork sandwich, it had pickles, slaw and chili. The biscuit was a great southern touch. I wish they would add it as a permanent item on the menu. The Huevos was okay, it came with warm tortillas, black beans, two eggs sunny, Manchego cheese, chorizo, guacamole, and charred pico de gallo. I personally didn't feel like it was anything special. The Smashed & Fried Potatoes were amazing. It had kimchi and fried onions. The potatoes were cooked then smashed on a griddle so it had a nice crispy yet chewy edge. Finally dessert, The pancakes were pretty good. We obviously had to add the smoked bacon. The pancakes were a bit dense, and I wish they added the blueberry sauce to each layer, overall it was good. I would definitely recommend this place for some good southern brunch. It's the ultimate comfort food.

The Carbon Bar,"What a great spot for a night out! Well, more like a great spot to spend two hours. I've been here a couple of times now and I just love it. The ambiance and decor make the place feel like a really cool, fun place to spend your evening. Sadly, they do push you to leave when you get close to the two hour mark. The food is really good but some of the items are not really what I would consider to be worthy of their price tag. For example, on my first visit, I ordered the duck tacos. While delicious, definitely not worth $17 for two tacos. Add a third, and I'd say that's more appropriate. Or, shave a few dollars off. Either way, too pricey for what you get and I'd never order them again. The bay scallop poke was just ok, in fact, completely forgettable. From the description on the menu, I expected more flavour but it was kind of bland. However, on my next visit, I had the Pit Master platter, and it was really good, and obviously very popular as I saw many of them being delivered to nearby tables. Three of us ordered this and then two of us had the Fishmonger platter, along with a few sides - corn bread and collard greens. The greens were greasy and the corn bread was dry, but they both had good flavour. The fries that came with the platter were sad and limp - we didn't bother with them. I really enjoyed everything on the BBQ platter - especially the chicken. It was so tender and juicy on the inside and beautifully crispy on the outside. I never order chicken in a restaurant because I feel it's something I can cook well enough at home. But this chicken, I'm sure I couldn't do better if I tried. I didn't bother with any of the sauces on the meat, as I prefer to taste the flavours of the meat itself. Loved how tender the brisket was, especially with the crusty edges. Yum! I usually prefer my ribs to be more ""falling off the bone"" tender, but I can appreciate different styles as well. These ribs had a bit more pull to them, but they were still really good. The Fishmonger platter was also quite impressive - the daikon and wakame salad was my least favourite, but everything else was great, especially the clams - I don't eat them often so they were a nice treat. Would've been better if there were a couple more oysters, too. Love raw oysters! The 5th person at our table had the octopus and said it was very tender and flavorful. I might get that next time, as I absolutely love grilled octopus. The service was really spot on, as well. I had a drink I really enjoyed on my first visit, but wasn't on the menu last time. When I asked, the bartender was happy to make it for me. Their bourbon drinks are incredible and really pack a punch - I just wish I could make them at home!

I got the tomato salad, the brisket and ribs, and the sundae.The salad was good, they used a variety of heirloom tomatoes including my favorites (kumatos). The cheese was almost like the cream from burrata, although a little saltier. I tried the scallop poke as well, it was also pretty decent. Both are things I definitely wouldn't associate with a bbq restaurant.The ribs were cooked properly, but the flavours were not very appealing, the dry rub was lacking in flavour and the BBQ sauce they had was way too tart. The brisket was extremely fatty and cooked poorly. It was as if someone boiled it and seared it lightly, the sauce was once again too sour. The coleslaw and pickle were alright, nothing standout.The rocky road sundae was pretty good, I liked the toasted marshmallows and the brittle they added.I had their smoked old-fashioned. It was a decent cocktail. It was a little strong on the palate at first and I didn't really get the smokiness, but as the ice melted, it really mellowed out and the emptiness was more pronounced.Service was friendly and no complaints from me.Prices are 32/person for the sampler platter and ~20-30/person for their regular entrees. At 38/person for summerlicious (appy, entree, and dessert) it's not too bad.Decor is grunge industrial and the dim lighting helps with the look.

The Carbon Bar,"Went for summerlicious with the family. The vegetarian option for entree was different on the menu on site from that advertised on the summerlicious website. However, the chef accommodated me and created an entirely vegan menu within summerlicious pricing just for me.Great food, fantastic service and highly recommended. The rest of the fam ordered off the set summerlicious menu and we had every item covered. Each item was so flavourful and perfectly cooked. What a fantastic place!",4.0,5.0,281,2017-07-09,43.653187,-79.374787,"Barbeque , Bars , American (Traditional)"
The Carbon Bar,"The Carbon bar has an open and contemporary decor. There is a nice bar area along with a sizable dining area. The neighborhood is a bit on the sketch side, but it didn't bother me too much.We came here specifically for the Pit Master Platter, which is a BBQ platter with fried chicken, pork ribs and beef brisket. IT also comes with fries and coleslaw according to the menu, but we only got fries....it didn't bother me that much since I never liked coleslaw anyway, but for others this might be an issue.Me and my friend was pretty impressed with the platter. For $30 a person, the portion size is definitely great and we were really full by the end. Both the brisket and pork ribs were very tender and flavourful, and the fried chicken (white meat) was deboned and had a very crunchy batter and it was great too.How does it compare to other famous BBQ joints? Well for one, Carbon bar takes reservations, in contrast to places like Adamson's where you might have to line up for hours before you get anything. I personally actually like the brisket here better than Adamson's (I will probably get some hate mails for this!). I have not tried the ribs at Adamson's so I cannot comment on that.I really wish The Carbon Bar had other BBQ items such as pulled pork or beef pastrami ribs so that it can be a full blown BBQ joint. Given that they also do other food items like seafood, tacos, brunch, etc, I know they will probably continue to keep a lean BBQ menu, which is a shame since they are doing a great job with the current items.Overall, I am definitely a fan of this place and will definitely be back!",4.0,4.0,281,2017-05-07,43.653187,-79.374787,"Barbeque , Bars , American (Traditional)"

The Carbon Bar,"I had seen a video of The Carbon Bar's Brisket Cheese Burger online, so I knew I'd be sitting down for a meal at some point.That point came one Saturday evening around 5:30 and the place was surprisingly crowded. We didn't have a reservation but we told we could have a table for an hour. Fair enough.We elected to start with the Hush Puppies (with jalapeno ranch sauce). I've had a lot of hush puppies during my travels in the United States and it pains me to say that these are far from authentic. I mean, they're fine, but they're just so dry and tasteless compared to the real deal. That sauce is quite tasty, though.The Brisket Cheese Burger (""brioche bun, sliced beef brisket, American cheese, charred & pickled chili peppers, burnt onion aioli, fries"") was next and my heart sank when I realized that it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. The fries were piping hot, which leads me to believe that the burger had been made many minutes earlier and just sat there until the fries had been prepared.Anyway, that aside, it's a very good burger. The meat is juicy and the various toppings are quite tasty, but that brisket... Even in the midst of all those condiments, I could tell that the brisket was super tender and crazy smoky. Smoky brisket in Toronto?? I hardly thought it possible!We closed out the meal with a plate of their Burnt Basque Cheesecake (with blueberry compote). It's an interesting dish, to be sure. It's basically not sweet at all, and actually doesn't taste much like a traditional cheesecake. But it's good. I don't know if I'd ever order it again, though.The mediocre appetizer, far-from-fresh main, and passable dessert forces me to give The Carbon Bar three stars. I could've forgiven the underwhelming starter and dessert had the burger been delivered fresh, is the bottom line here.",4.0,3.0,281,2017-01-24,43.653187,-79.374787,"Barbeque , Bars , American (Traditional)"
Buca,"Great place for a dinner date! Food 4/5: We started with the Parmigiana di Melanzane, which is basically an eggplant parm. The tomato sauce was flavourful with fresh basil and the eggplant perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I was disappointed at the amount of burrata cheese they gave but they did give a fair bit of ricotta. Next we shared the Bigoli, the sauce was rich and flavourful however the noodles were a bit too al dente for me, it was more like they weren't cooked properly. Then we had the Gnocchi Ripieni, and although you only get 6 pieces, its pretty heavy as each piece is stuffed with cheese.The dumping skin is so soft, you almost can't tell where the skin ends and the cheese begins. For dessert we shared 2 scoops of gelato (white chocolate cranberry and chocolate) and one scoop of sorbet (blood orange beet). The sorbet was by far my favourite - it almost tasted like strawberries and was so light and refreshing, the perfect way to end the meal! The white chocolate cranberry was also very nice but I found the chocolate to be nothing special (however my partner loved it and it was his favourite). My only suggestion would be for them to use chilled glass or metal plates as the ice cream melted fairly quickly on the ceramic.  Drinks 5/5: I ordered the BarBuca (I hope that's right, I can't find their cocktail menu online to confirm), a beet infused vodka drink and was immediately blown away! I had to order a second! The drink is sweet and cold, tastes like real beets. I also had a cappuccino which comes with a little piece of biscotti. Service 5/5: Our server was really nice, as it was our first time here she explained the menu to us and was great about us ordering one dish at a time as we wanted to share everything and relax during the meal. Our plates and cutlery were refreshed between every course and our water constantly filled. Atmosphere 4/5: The restaurant is smaller than I had pictured and the dinning room is split into 2 sections. One room is small and more modern looking with walls lined with wine bottles, the other room is bigger with very high ceilings and the walls are entirely brick.",4.0,4.0,362,2018-01-07,43.644512,-79.400362,Italian
Buca,"I came here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and I was surprised how not so good this place was. I scavenged the realms of the Internet to find a perfect Italian spot in Toronto, and I was kind of really disappointed. The ambience was ALRIGHT, the food was ALRIGHT and the service was just NOT GOOD. The only saving grace was that they (the executive chef???) were kind and gave my boyfriend a special present for his birthday (unexpected), but other than that, DAMN, not worth. The final bill came out to be almost 200 dollars. We made reservations for 9. We probably got there 3-5 minutes before 9, but we still ended up waiting 15-20 minutes for a table at the bar. (How??) When we finally got seated around 9:30, the two of us ordered:1. Orecchio di maiale  (pig ears)2. Nodini (warm bread knots)3. Funghi pizza4. Gnocchi ripieni 5. Sopresini alle vongole??? I cannot remember (All pictures are attached)6. Tiramisu The pig ears were delicious but damn, they were salty AF. So were the bread knots (which I thought would be soft and pillowy, but they were REALLY hard). I think my lips started to burn after a while. The pizza was OKAY, the mushrooms tasted amazing (I love mushrooms), but everything else in the pizza was just OKAY. I'm fine with OKAY, you know, if the food is OKAY, then it's not bad, which means the restaurant is coming-back-able.Then came our pasta dishes! Everyone supposedly loves al dente pasta, but I don't. I like my noods to be a little bit softer, but you know what, I'll eat al dente if I have to. I took a bite of my pasta, and it was REALLY al dente. I wasn't sure if I was delusional so I took another bite, and again, VERY al dente. But there was no way they could undercook my dish! It was a birthday event and I didn't want to send a dish back! But I asked my boyfriend to try a bite of my pasta and he confirmed that the pasta I was eating was INDEED CRUNCHY and I should send it back because it was quite inedible. We proceeded to tell one of the waitresses, who was just standing there and doing nothing. She came over and we both explained that the dish was undercooked and that it was hard and crunchy. I don't think she understood a single thing we said because she left and never came back. Nothing happened for the next five minutes, no one took my plate away, so we tried to wave at her, but she just looked away, like she didn't see two people trying to get her attention in the most polite way possible.  And then I never saw her again! I don't know, did she hide in the bathroom? We proceeded to tell someone else and he kindly took my dish away (and my boyfriend's dish) and said the chefs will cook the pasta dishes for us again. After a bit, he brought us back NEW dishes and we ate it, and I'm glad to say that this time, the pasta was NOT crunchy and it was al dente at its finest. We ordered tiramisu (which was crazy heavy and my BF LOVED IT) after our pasta dishes and our night ended when the executive chef brought my BF a special present. Honestly, if it wasn't for that dreadful experience with the waitress who ignored us completely, I would have given this place 3 stars! It's not like we were howling and screaming and crying for disgusting crunchy pasta. We told her politely that the dish was undercooked and she blinked once and that was all the interaction we got from her.  TLDR; Be aware of waitresses that pretend you don't exist and crunchy pasta. Come at your own risk.",4.0,2.0,362,2017-12-15,43.644512,-79.400362,Italian
Buca,"It was very average. The red wine that the waitress suggested was the only good thing in this restaurant. We were really shocked how popular this restaurant is after visiting.We got the nodini and it was way too crisp that it was difficult to chew or cut. They also put way too much garlic in it that we had to keep chugging water to balance it.For entree, we got bigoli (the duck egg pasta people have been raving about) and carbonara. Bigoli was completely undercooked and didn't taste anything special. Similarly with carbonara, it was very salty and undercooked.I won't go to this place again. It was too expensive for the quality of food we got and really average Italian food.",4.0,2.0,362,2017-11-27,43.644512,-79.400362,Italian
Buca,"Buca was such an amazing experience ! We made reservation for 5PM to celebrate a special birthday. The restaurant is located on the side of the building. When we walked into the restaurant, we were greeted by the host who directed us to our table. We were the first ones to arrive in the restaurant. The restaurant itself had dimmed lighting with opera playing in the baxkground, so the atmosphere was more fit for a romantic dinner. They have a very good selection of food on the menu, ranging from cheese board (choose three for $18), appetizer, entree and main course. They also have a very large selection of wine, 6 menu pages worth. Each item had a small description at the bottom helping diners understand exactly what it is that they're ordering. The menu had the current date stamped on it. The waitress explained to us that the menu changes almost everyday as the head chef wants to serve the freshest ingredients that the market has to offer each day. We ordered the pizza with spicy pork sausage, gnocchi, and sauteed new brunswick scallops. The waitress informed us that it will come in the order of pizza, gnocchi, and lastly, the seared scallops. The pizza was served on a neat little cutting board, with a pair of scissors for cutting the pizza. Now note that this is not your typical Americanized pizza. This pizza was longer and thinner. The crust was paper thin, topped with tomato, basil, and the in house spicy pork sausage. It was light, and each bite was packed with incredible flavour. Next came the gnocchi. The serving size of the gnocchi was much smaller than expected, we received a total of 5 pieces of gnocchi. However, each was filled with pesto sauce inside. When you bite into it, the pesto sauce bursts in your mouth. The gnocchi had a good bite to it, with a hint of cheese. Lastly, we received the scallop dish. The plating of these scallops was impeccable. Everything on the plate from the sauce to the scallops were aligned perfectly. The combination of the scallop sauce + scallop created this perfect harmony. I had requested for the sorbet trio to be served at the end of our meal as the ""birthday dessert"". They brought out the chocolate, basil, vanilla sorbet with a lighted candle. The sorbets were incredible ! They were all so so light and refreshing. As we waited for our bill to come, the manager came over to our table with a box with the date stamped on it. It was given to us as a birthday gift. Inside the box, there was fresh pasta, pasta sauce and cheeses to go with it. We made it for dinner the following night, it was such a wonderful and sweet little gift. The whole dinning experience was incredible ! We really felt like we were transported to italy.  I don't think I have ever written such a long yelp review for any other restaurants because that's how amazing this place is, it deserves an incredibly long review.",4.0,5.0,362,2017-11-24,43.644512,-79.400362,Italian

Unfortunately they were out of truffles at the time we went, however the pizza was still absolutely incredible! My second favorite dish was their Baigoli (torchio extruded duck egg pasta). I'm not a huge fan of ordering pizza and pasta in the same meal but this decision I was not disappointed with.

After walking down the stairs to the host stand, we got seated in the inner, lower level of the restaurant.

Buca,"Updated Review (previous review in Oct 2016).  My partner and I were so impressed with Buca our first time, we chose it as the venue for my parents' 25th Anniversary in May 2017. From the first email to their events organizer (Adrienne) to the moment I paid the final bill, everything was PERFECT. Adrienne was warm, professional, quick to respond, and made great suggestions regarding the menu.  The Chef was even kind enough to tailor the menu to make it a perfect evening for my VERY particular parents.  I was extremely nervous about the food (was afraid our first visit may have been a 1-off) but Buca once again exceeded all expectations.Not only was the food fantastic (too many dishes to list here) but the staff & service were impeccable. Adreienne, Josephine (our server) and Mario (the sommelier) ensured every detail was taken care of, from the personalized quote on the printed menus to the sparkling wine for the welcome toast, to the parting gift for my parents (pasta kit for them to enjoy at home). They even let me arrive early to place small pots of violets at the table (my mother's wedding bouquet flower).Our guests couldn't stop raving about the evening (including one guest who is also an Executive Chef!)  This restaurant now has a very special place in my family's hearts.",4.0,5.0,362,2017-11-03,43.644512,-79.400362,Italian
Buca,"My experience at Buca was an excellent meal in a surprisingly modern setting.The food was excellent. The cheese board was fairly portioned, with well-paired and understated additions. Our salad was a generous portion as well, and was extremely fresh and flavorful. The fried squash blossoms were likely the highlight of the night - a great combination of textures and flavors. The pasta was good, but not quite as good as I expected. Though the wine selection was extensive, I didn't like any of the by-the-glass options I tried. After I described what wine I liked, the waiter brought me three samples, and none were satisfying (high-maintenance, I know). My companion had a cocktail that was good, but too sweet to drink the whole thing.The service was decent, but very slow. Dinner took us two hours, even without dessert. Our waiter came around a fair bit, but was sometimes out of sight for quite a while when we needed something. I really loved the atmosphere inside - the high ceiling, low (but not too low) lighting, and the warehouse-y feel combined with the modern, upscale furnishings was both comfortable and trendy. Overall, I'd absolutely recommend going to Buca and making an evening of it.",4.0,4.0,362,2017-08-01,43.644512,-79.400362,Italian
Buca,"This place didn't do it for me. Yes, the staff are very knowledgeable and passionate about the food, but I wasn't really impressed by the food.The Bigoli (duck egg pasta with duck ragu) was the biggest joke. At $21, you get what looks like three bites of pasta. The Sanguinaccio (pork blood brownie), $12, was interesting, but it was a little gross to eat; not because it was blood, but because it tasted like blood. It was fun though because they lit it on fire.The Cervello (lamb brain wrapped in bacon), $9, was probably my favourite thing next to the pizza, but I'm discounting the pizza because pizza is so ordinary. The brain texture was really mushy and off-putting, but the bacon definitely saved it. And finally, the proscuitto pizza ($24) tasted perfectly fine. As pizza is kind of easy to make and ordinary, my only complaint is that it is about 100% overpriced. In general, this place was too expensive for the taste. I didn't find anything spectacular and I feel like the use of unconventional ingredients (lamb brain, pork blood) for excitement is a cop-out; other types of cuisines use them on a daily basis for better tasting dishes at a fraction of the price.",4.0,3.0,362,2017-03-04,43.644512,-79.400362,Italian

Buca,"This was a disappointing experience. I read about Buca on Eater and it was also recommended by a friend's friend. The space itself is sleek and beautiful. But it's also loud, so much so that I could barely hear my dining companions unless they were shouting. The space could use some warmth. The food was okay. We liked the garlic knots and cheese plate as well as the pastas. The carbornara stood out. The pizza was bland and warm at best. Where Buca really falls apart is the service. Now it's possible it could be remedied if you were able to hear your server. But that would mean my server would have had to come to the table. Obviously she didn't. She dropped off the menus and took our water orders. She then spent a very very long time to return, at which point we placed our orders - not just drink but for everything. It would have been nice for her to return to take our drink orders and ask us if we have any questions. After our food delivered, she all but disappeared. Not once did she come by to ask if we wanted another drink as our cocktail glasses sat empty. We had to repeatedly flag down other waitresses and bussers to get water. I had told the restaurant that we were there to celebrate a friend's birthday. Though none of us placed a dessert order, I thought they'd still bring something small out as most other restaurants do. I guess I could live with some of these things but not at this price point. Go somewhere else.",4.0,3.0,362,2017-08-15,43.644512,-79.400362,Italian
Buca,"This is my third time coming to Buca but first time writing a review on Yelp. If I wrote a review based on my last 2 visits this would be a 5+ star review.  However unfortunately for the restaurant I'm writing this review based on my current visit.  I came here for my 40th Birthday dinner with my aunts. This was my top pick so I wanted to come here for my birthday. From my past visits the service was impeccable and my main server was always so nice, helpful and friendly.  This time the server who's this tall blond lady was a little rude. She seated me while I waited for my aunts.  She knew I was waiting for more people to come and they were running late but she came to me twice asking if I wanted to order. Obviously I'm not going to order until everyone arrived.  When they finally arrived only 10 mins late I asked the server for her advice on the meats  and cheese to get on the charcuterie board but she seem impatient and short with me. She's like ""I don't know what you like"".  But I wanted her opinion as to what's good.  Shouldn't she be the one explaining the menu to me?!  In the end I ended up making an executive decision because she couldn't help me and choose some random stuff.  When I asked her for recommendations for the mains her answer was just get the dishes that's always on the menu, she said it's always there so People must like it!  In the meantime not answering my question as to what was in entrees.  Later on in the evening I was on the phone but I heard my aunt asking our server what they do for Birthdays.  I looked up from my conversation and saw the server ignored my aunt's question and walked away.  We got fed up and when asked for the bill it took her forever to bring it to us.  All the while the assistant servers were amazing and brought us water refill and chilli sauce when asked so quickly. I felt like the assistant servers were so much better than our server. We hope they get some of the gratuity we gave the main server since they deserved it more. So enough with my complaining about the poor service from this one individual.  Let's talk about Buca. The restaurant is in the basement so cellular service is very slow. However you're having a nice dinner you shouldn't be on your cell anyways!  The decor is very romantic and dim.  I ordered the peach Bellini which was yummy.  We shared the charcuterie board with 3 meats and cheeses and the baked olive with pork(a must have side) so delicious ! Mains we shared between the 3 of us the funghi mushroom pizza ($30)( I order this everytime, it's amazing), also the pigs blood spaghetti ($24) and Bigoli ($22).  Both pasta dishes and pizza were amazing.  After the main server ignored my aunt about the Birthday comment we decide we had enough of this poor service and forgot dessert and go to The Shangri-La Hotel for dessert instead. I was so excited to come to Buca and although the food was still out of this world the service for this visit left a bad taste in my mouth and ruin my Birthday dinner! That is why I gave Buca a 3 star instead of 5. Our server ruined Buca's perfect grading!! I think service is just as important as the food. I'm not sure if I would come back again with the poor service we experienced by our server.  For the price we paid I'm sure there's better Italian places out there that I can go to. Like Gusto 101 across the street or Terroni's which are my other two favs with amazing service consistently.  It's really too bad, since it was one of my aunts first time to Buca and I was ranting and raving about how great it was and it turned out she had a poor experience.  Goes to show how important it is to hire great people these days.",4.0,3.0,362,2017-11-04,43.644512,-79.400362,Italian
Buca,"I had high expectations with Buca as I've seen this restaurant on many top Canadian restaurant list over the years.  For a birthday, we came here to celebrate and the restaurant did not disappoint.  I can understand why it has been on many list and continues to be.  Buca's service is top or near the top in Toronto... fluid, attentive, and warm.  Food service is orchestrated wonderfully... the timing is incredible and precise.  The food itself is as delicious as it is beautiful.  And on top of that, a thoughtful gift from the chef ended the night on a high note.  Our interaction started before even we entered the door... a courteous call to me to confirm our arrival, understand any allergies, and if it was an event happened the day before.  Most of the time, Im not sure if that call is good (I can understand it from a restaurateur side it is) but I appreciated the extra questions to ensure we had a great experience.The restaurant is a wonderful juxtaposition of modern and heritage.  The building clearly has some old roots but its been updated to clean lines, exposed brick work, and artistic distress.  There are two rooms ... one looks to be cozy and held in the wine cellar.  It's gorgeous though... lots of glass enclosures highlighting their large wine library (the wine listing is quite extensive).  The other is huge vaulted ceiling, exposed open kitchen, instagram worthy filtered sunlight, and in the evening, a romantic atmosphere.  The atmosphere can change immediately though... earlier in the evening, it was easy to have a wonderful conversation.  As the night went on, a huge group arrived and clearly was looking to enjoy the night.  It was near impossible to hear across the table and we were about 5 tables away from them.  As for the tables, i do appreciate how i could walk between them without needing to turn side ways.The service staff here is impeccable.. in addition to the actual servers, we probably interacted with 4 other servers and runners making sure our glass was never left empty, dishes cleared immediately, new cutlery and plates are given, and delivery of food just freshly prepared.  Most of the time, this can feel over the top but there was a genuine warmth from them.  Comparing this to my other top restaurant, Grey Gardens, I would say Buca is a bit more refined and subtle compared to the more energetic and fun service.  Both worthy of being called top service though!  I did appreciate the in depth knowledge of our server though to help craft our perfect meal.  We ended up going with all of her recommendations.  We started with the scallops crudo, salami trio (cured goose, calabrese pork sausage, and proscuittini), eggplant parmigiana (parmigiana di melazane), trofie pasta (spring selection), duck breast (petto d'anatra), and finishing with the tiramisu.  Scallops Crudo - Incredibly gorgeous plating and the flavour matched it.  Thinly sliced scallops with a interesting smoked spring greens and ramps and a subtle heat coming from the n'duja in the sauce.  It could have easily overwhelmed the scallops but it just played that line very well.Salami Trio - we selected the goose, spicy pork, and a cured pork ... from those 3, I like the calabrese the most.  Full on flavour and with each chew, it just added to it.  The heat is not overbearing.  The goose was nice as well with the spice notes of clove, orange, and cinnamon.  It is very fatty... so for those who are not into fatty meats, it may not be for you.  The pork was very good but hard to keep up with the calabrese.  What stole the show was the pickled asparagus that came with it... wow, I wish I got more of that!  Just a right punch of sour, tart, and a minute sweetness.  Parmigiana di Melazune .. aka eggplant - A tower of burrata, creamy ricotta, and super crisped eggplant is presented on top of a balanced tomato sauce.  This is not your momma's eggplant.  It takes what is good from the regular Italian dish and just turn it up a notch with really good ingredients and execution.  I love the creaminess of the ricotta, burrata, and eggplant to contrast with the fried crispy shell on the vegetable.Trofie Pasta ... hand made al dente pasta with spanish octopus, n'duja, fava beans, grape tomato, and bone marrow.  Oh wow... this was very very good.  It has that perfect chew and nooks and crannies to take in all the wonderful sauce. It's a lucious tomato based one with a good kick of spice to keep your taste buds wanting more.  The grape tomato is a lovely burst of sweetness and the octopus was cooked wonderfully... tender!  Petto D'anatra ... duck - Ok another winner. It was cooked to medium well with a super crackly skin and the fat beautifully rendered out.  Well executed and the rhubarb was the perfect sweet tart compliment.Tiramisu ... gorgeous presentation and I love how the chocolate, espresso, and creamy marscapone played off each other.  One of the best versions in Toronto!",4.0,5.0,362,2017-05-16,43.644512,-79.400362,Italian
Buca,"I found Buca while wandering down King street just before 6pm.   It has a quaint, low key vibe with exposed brick, wood beams, and lots of natural light.  We were seated at a table near the kitchen.The wine list is very extensive, but there are a limited number of wines sold by the glass.  Glasses have two sizes: 3oz and 6oz.   The pasta was fresh and made by hand.  I had the gnocchi ripeni, which was by far the best gnocchi that I've had in a very long time; the filling, sauce and overall texture were amazing.  My companion had the bigoli (duck egg pasta) which was also delicious. We were unfortunately pressed for time and unable to taste dessert.The service was warm and attentive, and added to the experience.  I'd definitely go back when I'm next in Toronto.",4.0,4.0,362,2017-07-23,43.644512,-79.400362,Italian

Buca,Used to be a fan. Came a few minutes early and staff was unwilling to seat myself and my girlfriend despite having 6 tables empty while patrons continued to leave. The host was inept and could only tell me I was free to wait a half hour and I couldn't be accommodated. For fine dining this is poor service. The wait staff even made suggestions but the host couldn't get it together but was more than happy to seat what appeared to be his regulars. Unprofessional and fairly rude this evening. Won't return after he happily cancelled our reservation. Waiting in the cold is better than waiting around for them to get their acts together and decide to seat us. I'm unclear as to why they act so snooty and their food nor service is worthy of any acclaim. This isn't a Michelin star restaurant so you have no reason to act in such a poor fashion. Hopefully they will continue construction and close both entrances to this horrid place. Last time I'll make a stop on king west to this place.

Buca,"I came here on my last night in Toronto on a business trip on a recommendation. The venue and decor was very nice, a sort of classy hipster feel and underground. I ordered the bigoli pasta (pasta with duck egg). I got a complimentary 2 pieces of silician chickpea bread. The pasta was innovative, tasted like the duck eggs I had for Chinese breakfast at home. I asked for a side of tomato sauce for more tangy marinara flavor and they brought it as well. Great experience!",4.0,4.0,362,2017-10-06,43.644512,-79.400362,Italian

Ramen Isshin,"I've been coming here long before this place blew up, so definitely have been returning less often due to the long lineups. However, I have nothing but great things to say about the food here.I had the spicy red miso ramen, their signature menu item. In the past, I've always gone with the shio, but this is definitely my go-to now. Unlike other ramen, the chefs stir fry the vegetables under high heat before adding the rest of the ingredients into the bowl. This releases the fragrance and flavour of the vegetables into the broth! The noodles are also some of the best I've had in Toronto - they were bouncy and had great texture.The only gripe I have about Ramen Isshin is the tiny seating. We were seating in the middle of the restaurant, and it wasn't the most comfortable time putting away your coat and bag in such a small space.",4.0,5.0,376,2018-01-23,43.656458,-79.406981,"Ramen , Noodles"
Ramen Isshin,"Heard a lot about this place so finally decided to try it out. I came on a Friday night at around 7 pm and it was already packed. The space is quite small so not many tables. At first I was told it was going to be around a 30 mins wait but needs being closer to 50 minutes. I would suggest bringing a snack with you to survive the wait. The menu has quite a few options. I ordered their most popular menu item which was the spicy miso. The wait was longer than anticipated, the waiter explained they were making another batch of noodles. At this point, my friend and I were beyond hungry. The portions were decent and enough for one person but you could ask for more noodles for an extra $1.8. I liked the texture of the noodles and the broth wasn't too salty which I find to be common at other ramen places I've been to. It wasn't spicy so just a warning for any avid spice lovers out there. I may have inflated my rating slightly because I was so hungry but I would come back to try the tsukemen ramen or their more creamy broths. They do have vegan options where they use kale egg free noodles. My friend who ordered the veggie spicy miso said it was good. The price is on the higher end, averaging about $15+ for a bowl (more if you order toppings). Next time I'll be sure to come at a different time to avoid the long line ups.",4.0,4.0,376,2018-01-27,43.656458,-79.406981,"Ramen , Noodles"
Ramen Isshin,"I'm not sure why everyone has rated this place so high! It does not live up to the hype. We ordered the veggie spicy miso, the dip noodles, red dragon and the octopus balls.The octopus balls had 1 small piece of octopus in each portion and that was true for all 5 pieces.The pork in the soup was suuuuuper thinly sliced. As well, the flavours of the soup was muddled. It was MEH at best.To clarify for others- service was NOT fast (it was about 15 minutes from the time we ordered until we recieved our octopus and another 22 mins on top of that until we recieved our ramen) The marinated egg tasted plain and over cooked. The veggie miso tasted like expensive mr noodle. Overall this place must have a great profit margin because for 3 ramens and 1 octopus order we spent $60.

Ramen Isshin,"WHAT TO TRY?!The ramens! Spicy Red Miso is popular! Kotteri Rich Shoyu is creamy! Black sesame tan tan noodle is unique! We tried Spicy Red Miso ramen and Kotteri Rich Shoyu ramen and both were full of flavor. Too bad it's only two slices of meat per bowl, but each bowl can definitely fill you up. Spicy Red Miso has more shredded meats and bean sprouts. It is on the spicy side, but it's not unbearably spicy. Good for cold winter days! Kotteri has half of an egg and seaweed too, and it's really creamy! If you like creamy soup bases, then you'll like the Kotteri ramen. We also ordered takoyaki which was nice too. Freshly fried to order and lots of octopus pieces in each ball. The dish is also topped with dried shavings of squid! LAST TIP?!It's REALLY busy and too bad they don't take reservations. You can certainly put your name down and ask how long the wait is. I've seen people put down their name and come back awhile later after they find out how long the wait is and they don't lose their spot in the line! You might have to share a table with another pair of diners if you get a table for four and you're in a pair yourself.

Ramen Isshin,"Confession:  I'm NOT a big fan of ramen.  I think it's just o-kay/nothing special/don't get the hype.  Aside from that, depending on what time you get here, there'll probably be a wait.  Luckily, I came at an off-hour today, so we were seated right away...near the front door.The atmosphere here was not pleasant because there was NO HEAT on in the restaurant.  I actually kept turning to see if someone opened the front door 'cause there was a constant draught.  If it's cold out and the bodies inside aren't generating enough heat, please turn on the heater. In addition to the temperature, they were serving ICE WATER.  ICE WATER and it's -25, coldest day on record outdoors.  Why??!!  I couldn't help but think whether or not this was the result of the $14 minimum wage increase thing.Food tasted fine, the usual ramen, pork based broth, wavy noodles, etc.  My friend shared another dish with her son and they threw up/feel queasy now.  So they got food poisoning from their Spicy Miso Ramen.Since I'm not a ramen fan, I wouldn't voluntarily go back.  I certainly would NOT wait in a line!",4.0,3.0,376,2018-01-05,43.656458,-79.406981,"Ramen , Noodles"

I normally like to order a side of cha sun don (bork rice bowl) for a dollar cheaper if ordered with ramen. even though the flavour is simple, the taste is extraordinarywould highly recommend this place",4.0,5.0,376,2018-01-22,43.656458,-79.406981,"Ramen , Noodles"

It tastes really creamy and nutty. It's not your usual ramen broth! It is very unique. Adding the additional sesame makes the broth more bold. I tried my friends spicy miso and I loved that broth even more. It wasn't thick or oily. Very creamy and it had a bold flavor. I love the broth here.

Ramen Isshin,"Checking out other Ramen spots in Toronto, Ramen Isshin hit our list as one of the better ones worth checking out. We decided to brave the frigid cold and walk over here from down town Toronto. After a 30 minute walk in cold weather, we made it and unfortunately ran into a long queue. Thankfully we didn't have to wait outside (like we did at Sansotei). We ended up getting a spicy miso ramen and achicken karaage don to share. My girlfriend really seemed to like the ramen but I don't share the same sentiment. I thought it was good and certainly better than most places in Philadelphia, but below average when compared to the typical ramen spot in LA. For $16 CAD, I felt as if there wasn't enough meat (two little slices!) and enough noodles. The broth itself lacked the depth I look for in a nice bowl of ramen and I found the items within the bowl itself to be quite lackluster in regards to flavor and texture. The karaage don at $6 CAD seemed to lack at value with one piece of chicken. The texture of the rice and flavor of the dish as a whole were on point though. Decent experience, not worth the wait IMO.

You can also opt for the vegan noodles if you want. The waiters are staff are so nice and friendly and really helpful to any questions you may have.

The broth isn't very spicy, yet well balanced. It wasn't overly salty, the cha siu was very tender, and thinly sliced, almost melts in your mouth. The second time I went, I had the spicy red miso ramen, once again, it wasn't overly spicy, a little more than the black sesame noodles, but nothing crazy.

Ramen Isshin,"I'm not sure why I haven't tried this place sooner, especially since it's so close to work. Ramen Isshin has been on my food radar since first trying related restaurant Kiu in Markham. It was also on my radar because it is one of a few ramen places in the GTA that serves tsukemen which I have been dreaming about since our trip to Japan earlier this year.We were seated immediately when we walked in without reservation around 5pm on a Friday night. We ordered pork gyoza. Unlike most other places that serve pan fried gyoza (which I prefer), the pork gyoza here were deep fried. Being a dumpling fan, I still found the gyoza to be pretty flavourful. Hubby had miso ramen which had a surprisingly creamy and rich texture and flavour. The tsukemen was served boiling hot in a stone bowl which allowed me to enjoy hot soup even until my last bites of dipped noodles. The broth was rich and coated the thick chewy delicious noodles nicely. The broth for the most part wasn't overly salty (although became saltier towards the end of my meal for some reason). Both bowls of soup came with soft boiled halves of eggs and two pieces of lean pork. This place is pretty legit and I would say that their tsukemen is the closest to the flavour and texture of tsukemen I had in Japan.

Anyway, in terms of dining in and take out, I was really pleased. The staff was attentive and happy to accommodate our ingredient swaps (chicken instead of pork, and no onions). The portions were good, the prices were reasonable, and the service was quick, efficient and friendly. The downsides: no spices or hot sauce! Yep! And you can't choose your noodle type.

Really enjoyed the cheese pierogi that only comes with dessert. Wouldn't mind if they came with the mains. They give 5 cheese for dessert vs 8 potato for mains.Was so stuffed after this meal.

Loaded Pierogi,I visited Loaded Pierogi a couple days ago on a freezing Toronto night and it was hands down one of my favorite experiences in the city. The Mushroom Truffle Pierogi is by far the best one!

Loaded Pierogi,"I would absolutely recommend this place to and pierogi lover out there. The place is a small little thing but their menu certainly packs a punch. You get the option of having your pierogoes boiled or fried (I got mine fried of course) and then all the fixings on top. Very very good, im eastern European I know a good pierogi when i see one. They do also have a sweet pierogi on the menu which I absolutely have to go back and try! One last thing, the restaurant shares a bathroom with the place next door.

Loaded Pierogi,"Perogies... stuffed potato/cheese dumplings that were a staple while in school.  Buy a frozen pack, boil them, top with grated cheese... et voila!  European version of instant noodles!Was in the downtown area and the wife wanted try this place out after seeing the food truck last week.  Its a small place, more like a pub/bar close to St. Lawrence Market. In my head I thought ""loaded"" meant that each perogie would be filled with different fillings inside the perogie, but instead realized the ""loaded"" meant toppings on top instead.  The perogies are all the same and you can choose whether you want them boiled or lightly fried.  The toppings go on top which consists of about 8 perogies per order and costs about $8-17.The perogies were well done and each tasty.  Portions though were on the small size but relatively filling.  But if you were a big eater like me you will be left wanting.Its a good experience to try but not sure I would come back soon as this might be better as a food truck experience as the price point is high for what you get.",4.0,3.0,155,2017-03-17,43.647901,-79.373407,"Canadian (New) , Comfort Food , Polish"

Loaded Pierogi,"Came here for late lunch on Sunday. The place had plenty of seats, probably because it was around 2pm. Lots of light and friendly service. I ordered the Donald Duck ($16) - half and half (half crispy and half boiled) perogies. The dish came with roasted duck leg and 8-10 perogies (not sure how many there were exactly as I did not count). There were plenty of other options too as well as daily specials (that included a pint of beer and perogies for approx $15) - we thought the specials was a good deal but we did not like the option of the day so we didn't get that. The perogies were in good portion and very filling. A bit heavy must I say, but that is because of the nature of the perogies being very carb-heavy as well as the sauce.

Loaded Pierogi,"I went to the Gerrard location with my sisters while visiting Toronto. It was early evening and the place was full of natural light. There were these golden hanging lightbulbs which gave fabulous ambience once the sun started to set. We started to realize that the ""get loaded"" tagline was actually referring to the fact that this was a place to drink. Vodka, in particular!The menu is quite phenomenal. From Butter Chicken to dessert pierogies like Strawberry & Chocolate. There is something for everyone. I stuck to my seafood-loving roots and got The Catch, ""Atlantic lobster & crab with julienne sweet peppers, caramelized onions, hollandaise sauce, sour cream & green onions"". Damn! So delicious! And they were generous with both the hollandaise and the sour cream. Fabulous!I got my pierogies half and half which meant half boiled and half deep fried. Both were fabulous. My sisters on the other hand got all deep fried.Jamie ordered The Cabbage Patch Kid which came with crispy fried brussel sprouts, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, sun dried tomatoes, creamy ranch dressing, sour cream & green onions. She LOVES brussel sprouts!Shannon ordered The Porky Pig which came with crispy center cut bacon, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, sour cream & green onions.Everything was delicious. Jamie's brussel sprout healthy goodness was cooked perfectly and Shannon's was cheese and bacon bliss. The Loaded Pierogi on Gerrard has wonderful ambience so it is a great location for a family meal and if you want to add some vodka beverages to your cheese and potato dumplings, go for it! Service was lovely and the place always had people coming and going. It was quite packed when we left on my first Friday night in Toronto.

Each flavor was distinct and the pierogis were cooked to perfection.  We were even able to get a small side order plain for the kiddo and he loved them.  The restaurant fills up quick and I recommend If you have a little one going earlier rather than later since it has a hipper bar vibe at night.  Totally happy I found this gem and definitely worth the walk from our hotel!",4.0,5.0,155,2016-12-01,43.647901,-79.373407,"Canadian (New) , Comfort Food , Polish"
Loaded Pierogi,"I actually wanted to give this establishment a 2.5. Really not sure what the hype was all about, my fiancé is Russian so we were super excited to check this place out in hopes of getting some super fancy pirogies outside of the traditional East European pirogies.  The decor was welcoming when we came in. The hostess did not greet us when we walked in, a cook from the kitchen just told us to grab a seat any where we wanted.We came in hungry and the menu looked really appealing to us. the waitress told us right off the bat that the flavors or type of protein/veggies we choose will just be a topping on top of their basic potato pirogies. You can either choose the pirogies to be deep fried or steamed. We went with the traditional steam style. We were still Super excited about my 16$ duck confeit pirogies despite the fact that the duck meat would not be incorporated in the filling... So our meals came... and the presentation of our dishes were really disappointing. Imagine a basic poutine with a nasty gravy mix ... my green onions were so nonchalantly chopped... there was one big piece that was obviously chopped 3 times but failed to be separated. I understand this might just be a typical street food and I shouldn't have too high of an expectation but if you are going to use ""duck confeit"" - a traditional French dish as a gimmick... I, as a customer will appreciate a better presentation of the dish. However, the Duck leg was cooked fine, nothing special. The pirogies were fine, just some big giant mashed potato wrapped in a dough. My fiancée ordered the BBQ philly cheese steak and the meat was tough.. again, presentation was poor and the sauce was nothing special.I wouldn't come back to this place but if you want something super hearty and filling and you are too lazy to make your own mashed potatoes with your choice of protein, perhaps you should give it a try!Overall: 2.5/5Ambiance: 3/5Value: 3/5Food: 2/5Presentation: 1/5Service: 2/5",4.0,2.0,155,2017-04-06,43.647901,-79.373407,"Canadian (New) , Comfort Food , Polish"
Loaded Pierogi,"We thought we'd died and gone to pierogi heaven. $8 Canadian bought us a plate of fantastic pierogi--we got 2 varieties and shared, and this was a filling, unique meal. They start with the basic pierogi (dough filled with a potato-onion batter and folded over and sealed) and then either boil (traditional way) or fry to perfection. You can stop there with the basics, topped with sour cream, or you can get all kinds of add-on toppings, from bacon and cheese to kimchi. The bar selection is also good--try a fun, unique vodka to accompany your meal.

I live across the street and have come here a few times - the service and food are always incredible.

The pizza comes perfectly cooked every. damn. time!! And boy are they quick!! Each time I've been, they've had some sort of special going on - I like to get the 'pizza and pint' deal. The bartenders AND kitchen staff are both very accommodating. They even charged my phone one time (I know this is annoying, so thank you). The bar itself has very little seating, but I've never had an issue...After another positive experience with Corks, I felt the need to get on here and give you guys five stars because you deserve it!

Corks,"Love this place, I work nearby and we come here every Friday for the past year.  It's a little different than a traditional bar, it's like a bar inside a supermarket which is Longos in this case.  You have a bar that sits about 8 people and then you have the seating area which is really public seating, anyone can come and have lunch there.  But it is full service which means you have servers. They even have microwave and cutlery if you decide to bring your own lunch.Service is great most of the time, it's a very casual place to have a drink.  Most of their stuff are locally brewed, things you don't hear at a regular pub.  Every week seems to be different, they always have new stuff coming in.  I describe this as a cheap man's bar because you can grab a sandwich for $3.50 - $5 at Longos and have a beer and it will be all come to less than $15.  Or if you want something else, they have full buffet by the weight at Longos and fire oven Pizza cooked to order!They used to have a combo special, you get a beer and a burger with salad all for $12!  You can't beat that anywhere, unfortunately they moved this special from Friday to Wednesday!  Bring it back on Fridays!  So, Real Sports bar nearby for more formal stuff, this for your everyday casual drinking needs.  It's not a sports bar, they do have a few TVs but they're really small TVs.  It's a very very casual place to enjoy lunch and a few drinks.Everyone should try this place out, it's very very light on your wallet.  I wish they have more of these in Toronto, a very cool concept because not everyone wants to go into a full bar and spend $20 on a burger and another $15 on beer.",4.0,5.0,21,2016-10-15,43.64227,-79.380963,Tapas/Small Plates

Corks,"In search for some food and good beer/wine prior to an outing at the ACC? Look no further than corks. I recently visited Corks just before attending a Leafs game. The place was busy, since my last visit I did notice that they have added more seating and even have some waiters to come serve you at your table. My friend and I decided to grab 2 pizzas; I opted for the La Grilla pizza, all personal size pizzas will run you $8. Shortly after we ordered my pizza was brought to me and the waitress notified us that they had burnt the cheese pizza my friend ordered, she assured us that another one would be out shortly and that it would be on the house. It really impressed me that they were willing to own up to their mistake and gave us the pizza free without us having to ask, that's my idea of good customer service! My pizza was ok, the dough is thin and crispy, and it came with a generous portion of sweet peppers, artichokes, zucchini and mushrooms. There were too many toppings in my opinion, a little more cheese and sauce would have gone a long way. This was still better than any pizza you will get at a fast food chain and at $8 is a bargain for a decent meal around the ACC. The thing that will keep me coming back to corks is that they have a good beer selection, a few taps of local craft beer as well as a decent bottle menu, pints or bottles will run you about $6 again a bargain for this part of the city. I definitely enjoyed my local craft beer! If you are not a beer lover they also have a selection of Ontario wines. The service as I mentioned before was good, our waitress brought us our food and drinks in a timely fashion considering they were slammed. I will definitely be back at corks the next time I am hitting up a sporting event or concert at the ACC. * If you don't fancy anything they have on the menu you can go into the Longos grab something and eat it there, this is great especially for those of us who try to eat healthy.",4.0,3.0,21,2013-02-25,43.64227,-79.380963,Tapas/Small Plates

Corks,"When I first came over to the new Maple Leaf residences, I first ventured into the Leaf-owned mega-sports bar, RealSports and yes, it's very impressive at least in appearance. Lots of taps but nothing really out of the ordinary. Mostly Molson and Rickard's crap.Then I ventured down into Longo's.They've got a bar too. Yes, in a supermarket but forget about that for a moment. It's strictly beer and wine but it's all local. There's six taps and they are all Ontario based craft brews from brewers like Black Creek and Granite.The one I had was a Lager from Beau's All Natural Brewing Co. and it was exceptional. One of the best beers I've had in awhile. Pints typically cost $3-4 which is far less than purchasing a pint of crappy Molson upstairs. Better yet, since I was there on a Wednesday, I could order a pint of that and a 10 inch Stone Fired Pizza for 10 bucks! Yes, a combo deal and a really good one. The pizza is baked over at the supermarket and it is only sliced into four huge slices. Maybe too big. Six would have been more appropriate. Pizza was good but could have used more toppings. I guess that's to keep the price down.Bartenders are very knowledgeable and happy to share their experiences with the products. Best of all, it's a really quiet atmosphere. A far cry from the noise upstairs at RealSports or any Irish pub nearby. You can talk here! You can even read their copy of the Toronto Star while you're there if you like.

Carisma,OK OK OKKKK if you like truffle go here. They have a bomb truffle pasta and an amazing wine selection! I also got the lamb chops which were delish. The veal was sold out when I went unfortunately! Really great staff.Two cons: hard to find parking (because of the new laws on king the little parking next to them is always full!) I got an espresso and it didn't come with a biscotti. Super small I know but I couldn't help feeling a lil biscotti with my espresso would've been the perfect touch to my meal.,4.0,5.0,127,2018-01-30,43.649582,-79.375351,Italian

Carisma,"I was taken here for my belated birthday dinner..read some nice reviews on Yelp so decided to give this place a try. I personally think I was more impressed with the service than the food. The service was excellent, we were looked after to the T...checked up upon within reasonable time frames, poured our wine as soon as we were almost done to the last sip...so the service I would give 5/5...the complimentary bread was amazingly delicious...with rosemary, olive oil and salt...we kept on asking for more bread..omgoodness, we don't usually do this...The food was nicely plated and presented but the flavours were more like a 3.5/5 at least for most items we all tried. We ended up opening 2 bottles of wine that night, we ordered the scallop, tuna tartar (this was the best dish) with the taro chips, grilled calamari..When I checked the menu online, I was a bit surprised they had Osso Bucco becuz that is not a dish you see at most Italian places so we decided to give that a try, the veal was tender but the taste didn't hit the notes for me...We ended up ordering 2 pasta(s), we overhead the truffle pasta was suppose to be delish so we tried a small portion of it. Yes it was good but it was also pricey when we legitimately had one strand of spaghetti each...LOL...All in all, I think this place has impeccable service with a slight bit above average for the food. Hence, I gave this a 4/5...mostly was for the service..they deserve to be credited..I'm not in a huge rush to come back due to the pricing for Italian food. I still have other places to try...",4.0,4.0,127,2017-09-28,43.649582,-79.375351,Italian

It was amazing! I ate a piece before I could even snap a picture. We ordered the grilled calamari as an app. It was seasoned simply and well. You could taste the charred, grilled flavor. It was served with tomatoes, olives, etc. 5 stars for that alone. For entrees my friend got the daily special of halibut served with an avocado salsa she tasted tasted amazing. I got the rack of lamb cooked medium. The seasoning was perfection and the lamb was cooked perfectly. It came with mashed potatoes and vegetables. I cleaned my plate.

Carisma,"We came as a party of 4, and were all pretty disappointed. The food was ok - we expected more at that price point - but the worst part was the service. The waiter was condescending when we asked about the more expensive wines. My steak, which I ordered medium rare, came well-done. To their credit, they did apologize and re-make the steak, but by the time it came back out, everyone else was finished with their mains and it made my dinner quite awkward.

Carisma,"3 starsWe started our evening being seated at the back.  There were 11 of us and quite honestly I felt squished and it was really cramped.We ordered the grilled calamari to start which IMO was not with $17.  The server was great as she split the dish in two for me and my wife to share.  It was a bit burnt.  The olives and tomato was a nice addition to the appetizer.  We had the Pappardelle Al Cinghial and the Risotto Ai Porcini.  The Pappardelle was alright and the sauce was made with wild boar meat... We would know from the taste.  The Risotto was okay... Wished there were more mushrooms though.  For dessert we had their lychee creme brulee which was okay.Service - It was alright, but would have been nice if we weren't seated in a cramped place.  Service would have been better if we weren't asked to pass the utensils down the table.Food - Bleh.  Not worth the price",4.0,3.0,127,2017-12-19,43.649582,-79.375351,Italian

When our food arrived then they gave us breads. I didn't even have the chance to try their breads since I was already so full after the main course. The service was decent, but I felt really pressure and they weren't really patient. The place is also really dark, it makes it really hard to see and eat our food.

The lobster scialtielli on the other hand were too thick, luckily I only order the appetizer portion.Branzino was over grilled with a burnted taste.

Carisma,"Word of warning--if you make your reservation with Open Table online, call after its confirmed and see if you can get a table up near the front (table 17); don't let them give you table 1 or 2. They stick tourists there and they are right next to the kitchen and bathroom and are very loud. Kind of ruins the ambiance and devalues your expensive meal, especially when there are several empty tables up front an hour later as you're leaving.That aside, our server was excellent, the food was delicious and the pacing good. It was just impossible to carry on a conversation during the last half of our meal because of the loud noise level. It was quiet and peaceful in the front.Wouldn't come back based on this--there are other places with great food and better seating.",4.0,3.0,127,2017-07-12,43.649582,-79.375351,Italian

Carisma,"I have worked a couple of blocks away from Carisma and couldn't believe I had never been here before.  The ambiance inside is very classy.  Nice plush, velvet seats and sparkling chandeliers.  I was  hear for a ladies night and we spent probably 2-3 hours there.  We started with an antipasto plate.  Instead of providing us with one big plate to pick at, they individually plate the antipasto.  There was a warm mushroom salad, arugula wrapped prosciutto, grilled squid, shrimp and some mozzarella and tomato.  Delicious and freshly prepared.  Not a huge fan of the salad and squid, but that was just personal preference, so I traded with my friend.I really wanted to try to Oso Bucco but when the waiter told us about the specials and I wanted pretty much every one, I decided to try a special and come back for the Oso Bucco.  When we were told about the specials, we were told about all of the fresh delicious ingredients, many of them being flown in right from Italy.  I opted for the veal t-bone.  I wanted it cooked medium rare.  Unfortunately part of it was medium rare, but most was rare.  To be honest, I wish I got the other special I was eyeing...the truffle butter pasta.  Most of my party ordered that for their main, so I got to try it.  It was so tasty and just melted in your mouth.  For dessert I had the tiramisu.  That was their special that night.  It tasted so authentic and homemade.  It was such a delicious meal I cannot wait to go back.  It really brought me back to Italy (where we had all been for our friend's wedding only months before).",4.0,4.0,127,2017-08-08,43.649582,-79.375351,Italian
Carisma,"My boyfriend and I came to Carisma for dinner. The atmosphere is dim and candlelit - great for date nights! Service was excellent. Our server was very entertaining and checked on us at good intervals. He was great at answering the questions we had about the menu items (translating some words for us in Italian haha).* BREADIt was complimentary bread but I felt like I should write a note about it.. It's yummy!! I love how sizzling hot it was - the olive oil + salt was a great combo for dressing.* TAGIATELLE IN BUTTER AND TRUFFLE SAUCE (4/5)I loved this pasta! It was one of the pastas of the day, which was recommended by our server. Loved the truffle sauce. I've always been a fan on truffle-anything so I am picky when it comes to this! The sauce was creamy and flavourful, the cream does not overpower the truffle flavour. I'd recommend you order this if they make it available for the day :)* BRANZINO (3/5)(Mediterranean Sea Bass, Grilled with olive oil and lemon)This was ok - I felt like the lemon sauce was too much. The fish tasted sour-y because there was too much lemon juice drenched over it. It would be much better if the lemon juice was toned down a bit!* OSSO BUCO ALLA MILANESE (2.5/5)(Veal Osso Bucco, Saffron Risotto, Herbed Gremolata)This was too bland for my liking. The risotto was watery due to the sauce from the veal. The veal didn't have much taste to it - not sure if this was marinated. I wouldn't recommend this dish.Overall, I'd recommend ordering the pastas at Carisma.",4.0,3.0,127,2017-01-31,43.649582,-79.375351,Italian
Carisma,"If you are looking to Celebrate a Birthday Beware!!! We booked Carisma for a large party surprise Birthday Celebration. The reason why I am giving Carisma 2 stars is the servers and atmosphere was nice, bread and starters were ok. Underwhelming but not bad.Here is the reason for 3 star deduction: 1) We got charged a whopping $48 + Tax for a Cake cutting fee that they never mentioned till the bill came out. Unethical money grab especially considering how much we spent as a group.2) The Pasta which should be the star and staple of an Italian restaurant was bland and overpriced. I ordered the special 'truffle pasta' (whopping $45) which I was pleasantly told at the time I could do half and half with the Ravioli ($27). Rather than charging me half and half of each, they decided to charge me the full price of the more expensive dish. I've never paid $45 for a plain bland pasta with a couple flakes of truffle... Both pastas were bland to a point that I could still taste the water it was boiled in. Neither had a sauce and pretty much just felt like it was boiled, tossed in some oil with a little bit or Parmesan and some truffle flakes. Not worth the price tag, frankly I could probably do a better job at home for less. Was not very impressed.3) Customer Service response. At the time we received the bill, they never apologized for the secret cake cutting fee, we didn't want to make a big stink since the birthday girl was there. I tried contacting the place after but no response. Overall, I've been to much better Italian  restaurants with better flavour (in this case, this place barely had any) and more reasonable price point. If you like bland Pasta, I guess this is the place for you. Otherwise if you're looking for a restaurant that really elevates the flavour in a dish like me, this isn't the place for you.",4.0,2.0,127,2017-10-03,43.649582,-79.375351,Italian

Carisma,"One of my favorite Italian cuisine places! The atmosphere is amazing and the server is really helpful. My partner and I went there for our one year anniversary. I have to say it's a perfect dating place with the flowers on the wall and the dim candle light.We had the seared scallop as the starter. Scallop cooked to perfection, the mushroom and spinach underneath are also sautéed and seasoned very well. Everything is nice, just a little bit oily. I had the meat of the day which is a mixed grill meat plate with New Zealand lamb rack and beef tenderloin. Super tasty, perfect medium rare. The mash potato is very tasty as well. I enjoyed every bite of it. My partner has the veal chop. It's the best veal chop I ever had! It's really tender and juicy, also cooked to perfect medium rare. Even though it's a rather pricey place.

I mentioned that I had a nut allergy when placing our order and explicitly asked the server if there were any nuts in either of the two dishes we ordered-he confirmed that both were nut-free. Our food came out and the server suddenly said I'd told him I was going to have Dish A (I never mentioned who was going to have which dish since we were planning to share the two dishes). He said he was sure Dish A was nut-free but wasn't sure of Dish B. It was only then he went to check with the kitchen staff that Dish B was also safe. As well as failing to properly inform the kitchen staff of my allergy, he made no apologies (actually seemed irritated!) and didn't come back once to check in on us after we started our meal.

Cactus Club Cafe,"A trendy place located in the heart of the Financial District of Toronto at First Canadian Place. The indoor entrance is located at the First Canadian Place food court and it is conveniently connected along with the path. The design and menu made me think of Joey's for some reason.I came here with a big group as we sat up on the deck level which is the rooftop patio level. In the summer time, it must be nice with the roof open. However, during the winter season, it is covered up but not fully sealed so you can feel a cold draft at times. They have heaters on the ceilings but if you sit right below them, it can be very, very hot. We got to sit in one of the booths but I thought that a booth is a bit too small for a group of 7 people.I ordered the cajun chicken sandwich with fries. The food came out promptly and it is a great sandwich. It did not look filling at first but as I kept taking more and more bites, I am definitely wrong. The chicken is grilled and not fried which is great. The sandwich was topped off with age cheddar. The fries were also good.

Cactus Club Cafe,"Went here for my birthday lunch with family. The food was really good but it took a while to come out. Some of our favourite dishes:- tuna stack: probably our favourite. It had a perfectly balanced taste- nothing was too overpowering. The chips it came with provided the perfect texture for an amazing bite. - sablefish: the broth that this comes with is soooo good (also made a really good dipping sauce for fries!). The sablefish itself is very smooth and goes well with the asparagus and shiitake mushrooms. However, I did feel like the fingerling potatoes were a bit too mediocre.- Korean short rib: this double braised short rib dish is really good. Presentation was a bit lacking, but the short rib itself was so tender. It came with very rich mashed potatoes and crisp snap peas.

As an app, we had the garlic fries which were perfect for sharing and delicious. The aioli was sooo good alongside each bite.For main entrees, I had the short rib pappardelle which was very flavourful and hit the spot. My friend ordered the highly talked about butternut squash ravioli and she enjoyed it. She mentioned it was quite rich but delicious and the portion was a good size.

For main course I got the modern bowl with salmon which was really good I just didn't tabouli salad. One of my friends tried the butternut squash shrimp ravioli it tasted good but the squash was a little on the sweet side. And another friend got the fish tacos that were so salty we had to send them back. For dessert we tried the key lime pie which was tasty. I would recommend the Frosé as a drink!

When it first opened it was crazy busy and you had to make reservations 2 weeks in advanced. Now that there are several new restaurants opened in the area it has slow down.  Except in the evenings when business people  come for after work drinks.  This is my first review. Of all my experience I would give Cactus Club Cafe a 4 star.  The service is always consistent.  A few favourite appetizers I've tried is the calamari, good and tasty. Chicken wings are small and dry.  The shrimp ravioli is amazing. Lettuce wrap is also great! I've tried most of the main dishes.  The short ribs pappardelle with arugula is great.  This was the dish in the picture attached.  I love their specials. I had the pineapple and hoisin beef short Ribs with with snow peas and mash potatoes.  It's was amazing a must have. Their spicy chicken sandwich is great, salmon is great. Also I had their duck sandwich it was amazing. All in all great experience here.",4.0,4.0,294,2018-01-10,43.649384,-79.382507,"Cocktail Bars , Canadian (New)"
Cactus Club Cafe,"Delicious butternut squash ravioli. I wouldn't change anything about it. Steak is also very tasty. The Brazilian cocktail was pretty good. The Fawlty tower cocktail is not bad but it taste a lot like grapefruit and I personally don't like this fruit. I didn't really read the ingredients properly before ordering it (my bad). Key lime pie is good for sharing because it's pretty big. It's good but I wouldn't order it again.Ambiance, service and cleanliness is 10/10.

Cactus Club Cafe,"A-Ok for Cactus Club.  I pass by this place all of the time.  It has an Earl's or Shark Club feel - waitresses in short dresses, loud music and an after work, financial district feel.  Although it's generally not the kind of place I would find myself after work, I had a nice summerlicious dinner with the girls on Wednesday.The 4 of us sat upstairs in a spacious booth.  I liked the colour lights hanging over the bar up there.  I ordered the butternut squash ravioli to start, the peppercorn NY strip for the main and the chocolate mousse to finish it off.The ravioli was amazing.  It just melted in your mouth.  It had shrimp on top, which I didn't feel added much to the dish.  I ended up mostly eating the shrimp separate and then the ravioli.  I think they put it in for protein and to beef up the dish a bit, but it's not really needed IMO.  That being said, I would order this again in a heartbeat.  I received my ravioli after everyone else received their apps (everyone else had the tuna tartare.  one was brought out for me, but that wasn't what I ordered.).  Fortunately their apps were cold b/c they insisted on waiting until I get mine.  Kind of shitty I had to wait, but the waitress was very apologetic,The NY strip was cooked perfectly (medium rare), and the buttered potatoes and asparagus were delicious accompaniments.  My boyfriend and I always say, don't order steak unless you're at a steak house (b/c it seems that restaurants always f*ck it up), but this entree was actually quite tasty.  Although I much prefer steak at a steakhouse, this one was a step above most non-steakhouse restaurants, as they at least cooked it properly. The chocolate mousse at the end wasn't much a mousse, rather more of a soup.  Definitely not the star of the meal and I would not order this again.",4.0,3.0,294,2017-07-22,43.649384,-79.382507,"Cocktail Bars , Canadian (New)"

Levetto,"""I thought this was TO finest"" -FriendMy stomach was growling and I wasn't feeling Chinese or anything too ""grubby."" I came here on a Thursday afternoon into a fairly empty store. Like any other downtown restaurant, the space ran deep despite its small storefront. The process works like this: order at the cashier, pay, take a seat, the servers bring you your meal. Levetto has a variety of pizzas and pastas. We ordered the Bucatini Pasta and the Pollo Toscano Pizza. The Bucatini contained guanciale, sauteed red onions, chilli flakes, and a spicy tomato sauce. The Pollo Toscano was topped with chicken, sundried tomatoes, tomato pesto, red onion, and fresh basil. After ordering, you collect your utensils - they had both metal and plastic cutlery. My friend and I sat right beside the window, the best spot in the house! I like how they brought us a pitcher of water and would refill it when it was empty. The food:-Bucatini pasta: crunch from the guaniacle (Italian cured pork, like prosciutto), pasta had a nice consistency and length per strand. The pasta was coated in a thick tomato sauce that had a perfect blend of spices. -Pollo Toscano: everything was good besides the fresh basil. It does look good (especially for photos) but personally, not a fan of eating it. I've visited their other locations and in general, I find that their stores are quite consistent with their dishes.",4.0,5.0,117,2017-12-07,43.655289,-79.399303,"Pizza , Italian , Salad"
Levetto,"The best Italian dish for me signifies simplicity ... simple fresh ingredients combine together to create unique meals bursting with supreme flavours. And all of this you can find at Levetto. It's a 'limited service restaurant' meaning you generally order your food in the front and pay for it before eating. You then take your seat and someone brings the food/drinks and plates to your table.  You also have to get the cutleries and condiments yourself.It's neither a large nor small place, more of a cozy place where you can have a quiet dinner with your SO or meet with your friends.But it's not the ambiance that makes this place special, it's the food. The Soppressata Pizza is spicy and salty in a balance way that's completely addicting.My favorite is the Pomodoro Pasta ... perfectly simple but oozing with flavours.  I can eat this everyday! If you're craving for good Italian food, then you have to try Levetto coz you won't regret it.",4.0,4.0,117,2017-11-11,43.655289,-79.399303,"Pizza , Italian , Salad"
Levetto,"So I tried the pizza there and it was okay??? Like it wasn't the best, but it also wasn't the worst. You know how there was that one person in high school that was in all your classes, but you never really noticed them? They were just there. Ya, well that's how I feel about the pizza. Which, according to a bunch of reviews, is the main selling point of this restaurant.Anyway.The four stars is all for the cavatelli pasta. My, oh my. What. A. Dish. A+. 100%. 4.0. The truffle oil takes it from 0 to 100. I normally hate ricotta cheese (seriously, why call yourself cheese if you don't taste like anything????) but this is the one and only dish where it actually works. The price for the dish is a bit expensive. (I'm seeing all these comments about great price and I'm just here with my 14$ cavatelli oops. )Ya. I could honestly go on for DAYS. The cavatelli pasta is a delicious work of art, and if I had Shakespeare's writing skills, I swear I would write sonnets about it. But alas.Aside from the cavatelli dish (wow, still writing about it, even though I said I would stop), the rest is okay. Honestly, I don't remember much about other aspects of the restaurant (service, other food, price) because, literally, all I think about when I'm at Levetto is cavatelli.",4.0,4.0,117,2017-10-07,43.655289,-79.399303,"Pizza , Italian , Salad"

Levetto,"//OVERALL THOUGHTS//FANTASTIC pizzas for a VERY reasonable price. Ranging from $7-$18.50 depending on the size and flavour. Each pizza had tons of quality ingredients and made to perfection with great portions. //THE FOOD//Peking Duck Pizza (5/5) - who knew hoisin sauce, cucumbers, and duck would be a match made in pizza heaven? There was just the right amount of the sweet & salty from the hoisin sauce without overpowering the cheesy flavour and crisp succulent duck bits, while the diced cucumbers and green onions gave the pizza the freshness it needed. Funghi Pizza (5/5) - for any mushroom lovers out there, this is the best pizza you'll taste. There's a mix of portobello, cremini, & oyster mushrooms with the amazing garlic white sauce and a generous amount of incredibly finely shredded white cheese. Everything just melts together with every bite!!Soppressata Pizza (3.5/5) - a more classic tasting pizza with tomato sauce, basil leaf on each slice, and spicy salami. Patate Pizza (2/5) - Looks a lot better than it tastes. I found that it had a much lighter taste than the other pizzas, which came off as bland to me. The scalloped potatoes tasted like it wasn't seasoned at all, but I was a fan of the fluffy fresh ricotta cheese!Misticanza Salad (3/5) - lots of greens with refreshing bites of mandarin oranges and the dill dressing was light and flavourful.Romaine Salad (2/5) - tasted like any typical Caesar salad, the garlic dressing was good, but the croutons were SO stale and gross.//THE ATMOSPHERE//You find your own seating and order at the cash register. They'll bring your food over but you're responsible for getting your own cutlery and napkins from the cart. They provide vases of water for your table to pour yourself but if you need a refill, you must go up to the counter to ask for it! Otherwise, the staff is quite friendly. The space itself is clean and basic, and seats ~20 people in the entire place.

Staff does their job, but not overly helpful upon entering the space. Maybe because it's an over-the-counter style place, but it would have been nice to be walked through their ordering process and menu.PRICE: Average.

They offered us dessert on house so I appreciate their kind service...even though I didn't tip them. The food is however a bit disappointing considering the good ratings on yelp. I got the carbonara and paid $6.50 extra for the lobster add on. It was a bit too salty to my liking and tasted nothing special and mediocre... I got the Warm Brown Butter & Coconut Semolina Cake - it's a good blend of ingredients with pistachio and coconut but their loaf cake is way too sweet.

Levetto,"My office wanted to celebrate the end of a project, and we wanted to choose a restaurant that had a private room and offered pasta on their menu. Immediately I knew that it had to be at Levetto in Chinatown. So I reached out to Levetto, and one of the owners (Nic) confirmed my reservation within an hour of emailing him. Awesome service! Nic reassured me that my team would be well taken care of, and that they would love the food (I have been to Levetto many many times, but my guests had not). The evening of the reservation we were quickly ushered to the back room (private room) and everything was already set up for us. Immediately we began to scan the menu, and the one thing we found inconvenient at that point is that their drink menu does not appear on their paper menu - you have to look at a screen on the wall for the drink menu. The food however did appear on their paper menu. There were a couple of tiny hiccups (salad was missing a main ingredient - but quickly rectified when we pointed it out, and the dishes came out slightly staggered). But overall the meal was delicious, the quality excellent and there was value for money. Levetto never disappoints, and I am always eager to return. P.S. Dessert was on the house! How cool is that?!

It's more of a self serve order at the front and grab your own utensils restaurant. The atmosphere is very laid back but offers high quality food. The servers were very kind. The price is okay I think. For a shareable pizza + a pasta it'll set you back around $30+. Depending what you order just the 2 dishes can be $40. I do like this setting compared to a higher class Italian restaurant if I feel like just grabbing some decent pasta.

The Hoisin sauce that you actually put on peking duck, gave the pizza a nice sweet and savory flavour, paired with the meat.Paired with a glass of house white wine ($6); can't go wrong with that for a broke student's meal. ;)What I find can be an improvement is if they offered whole wheat/gluten-free dough as well.Overall, I enjoyed everything about this cute gem in Chinatown.",4.0,4.0,117,2016-11-18,43.655289,-79.399303,"Pizza , Italian , Salad"

We split rigatoni pasta and a shareable size peking-duck pizza (double the price- $20). Their pasta is made from scratch and piping hot- really yummy! Their peking duck pizza really DOES taste like peking duck. It's not for everyone (I wasn't a big fan) but I do appreciate how unique this dish is. I will come back to try out more pasta dishes, but I would get pizza elsewhere. A single size pizza contains 4 slices for $7-$10, and a shareable size pizza contains 6 slices for $13-$18.

Antler Kitchen & Bar,"Came here on Saturday afternoon for brunch with 3 friends. It's a small space with a cozy, warm atmosphere. I really liked some of the wall decorations (such as the antlers; how fitting). There were a couple of other tables in the restaurant but lots of open space. Our server was extremely friendly and accommodating, so props to her. The food didn't take too long either which is always a bonus when you're starving. There are about 6-7 options on the brunch menu. My friends opted for the Eggs Benedict and I got the Omelette with cheese, mushrooms and caramelized onions. I also added pork belly bacon.Honestly, I wasn't crazy about the brunch and neither were my friends. It was expensive ($17+$4 for the bacon) and I feel there are much better, cheaper brunch options in the city. The omelette was good, but very rich (too rich for me at breakfast) and a little greasy. The potatoes were delicious. The bread that came with the brunch looked homemade and was phenomenal. None of us really liked the pork belly bacon.

Antler Kitchen & Bar,"Small and intimate locale with some good eats (and some misses). My bf and I came based on a friend's recommendation. For appetizers, we got the wild mushroom torte and the wild boar spring rolls. We wouldn't normally get that much before the entrees but I was starving that night and just couldn't wait! The torte was a bit bland - I think it would have fared better with some sort of sauce accompaniment. And the spring rolls were a bit burnt. I think the issue was that their spring roll making technique was off.  It was made too loose, causing the filling to be exposed to the hot oil, resulting in it being oily and slightly burnt on the ends. The saving grace were the entrees. I ordered the Cornish Hen, which was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, and paired well with the roasted heirloom carrots, bitter greens, roasted potatoes, and roasted onion jus. The bf ordered the pappardelle, with braised rabbit, buttered leeks, apricot preserve, parmesan cheese, and sautéed greens. All in all, based on my one time experience, if I were to come back, I'd probably opt for the entrees and pass on the appetizers.",4.0,4.0,105,2017-11-05,43.649718,-79.430604,Canadian (New)
Antler Kitchen & Bar,"Been here twice for dinner! Once on a Sunday night and the restaurant was fairly full and on a Tuesday night which only a few tables were full and you could probably walk in without a reservation. For appetizers I had the cheese and charcuterie board. Good selection of both, the cheeses were quite mild including the blue but the blueberry compote was perfectly sweet. There was some interesting gamey meats, the tongue was very tender and rarely seen on charcuterie boards. The Heirloom Tomato Tarte Tatin was good, the tomatoes were fresh but the pastry was slightly soggy and i wish it was crisper. The Jamaican Venison Patty could be passed, wasn't outstanding. The Venison Tartare was good, not much different from a regular beef tartare but maybe even better because there's a stronger meaty flavour to it and it comes with lots of grainy mustard. The Spice Ash Crusted Prime Cut of Deer - OMG this was amazing! if you are going to get anything on the menu this is the THING TO GET! The night I went it was the rack cut. It was so tender, not chewy at all, perfectly cooked, juicy inside nice smokey crust on the outside and it comes with 2 slices. The braised rabbit Pappardelle - AGAIN SO GOOD! definitely my second recommendation, it was so satisfying, thick handmade noodles with great chewy texture, umami savory sauce, soft rabbit with just a little bit of bitterness from the greens . My god im drooling just thinking about it. Bison Rib Eye - Meaty deliciousness, again perfectly cooked but it was a little bit tougher than the deer. And unfortunately the Bison Flank Steak was quite tough and dryer compared to the other meats. The sticky toffee pudding dessert was good, it's served warm with a scoop of ice cream. The ceder infused ice was refreshing and tasted like nothing else! it didn't taste like a tree it was slightly sweet and comes with the same blueberry compote as the cheese board. And the star, the chocolate mousse! Once they start bringing it out everyone gets intrigued. It comes with a dome filled with smoke, and when the server opens it the smoke puffs out, its quite a visual experience. The mousse itself was dark and the crunchy caramel added a bitterness, good dessert for someone looking for something not that sweet. Service is always great, friendly and they explain the menu well. There is a $3 charge per person for water though. It's not the cheapest, but very much worth it!",4.0,5.0,105,2017-10-31,43.649718,-79.430604,Canadian (New)

This was my first time trying it and it won't be my last!  I'm not sure if it's the method of poaching the eggs or the eggs itself but what I got was two perfectly poached eggs with uber yellow-orangey yolk running down on wild smoked salmon and crunchy English muffins, it was literally heaven in my mouth.  I haven't had salmon egg Benny this good in a while.  It had the perfect mixture of flavours and texture.  For the sides, you can choose potatoes or salad, I chose the salad after a weekend of dining out.  I loved the dressing on the salad, it was a creamy dressing that really enhanced the flavours of the egg Benny. Our second order was the blueberry french toast, it was just ok to me. Their coffee comes in 2 sizes served from a French press.  The $4 will give you 1.5 cups while the $6 will give you approximately 3.5 cups. Good brunch without lineups is rare for the Toronto brunch scene. Better get to it before everyone else finds out about it.",4.0,4.0,105,2017-07-23,43.649718,-79.430604,Canadian (New)
Antler Kitchen & Bar,"I've been here THREE times - twice for dinner (July 2016, July 2017) and once for brunch (December 2016) - and Antler Kitchen & Bar has never disappointed me. I love Canadian cuisine, especially Antler's Canadian cuisine. I love the foraged concept, the wild meats, the regional ingredients. I really love the decor of the restaurant. It's small, which goes well with the theme and the exposed brick walls. It's all a very wild concept and I can't get enough of it. I follow Chef Michael Hunter on Twitter, on Instagram. I follow the restaurant on Twitter, Instagram, and I think even Facebook. Yeah, so if you see KELLLSIFY liking things on Instagram and Twitter, and I don't know, Facebook, THAT'S MEEEE. Here are all the items I've ever ordered:1. The Seasonal Soup (I don't remember what it was called, but it was tasty!)2. Charcoal Grilled Yakitori - Chicken Thigh, Wild Mushroom, and Duck Heart3. Pappardelle (First time I tried rabbit!)4. Roasted Duck Breast (I love duck, it's probably my favorite protein, but damn, that butternut squash pure is something else)5. Eggs Benedict - Pork Belly6. Foraged Cedar Infused Ice7. Some sort of cheesecake, it had pistachios and berries I think (Off menu as of July 2017)8. Maple Toffee Pudding (WOWOWO THE BEST. My BF loves ginger ice cream and the wild ginger ice cream got him wild. I will never eat ginger ice cream the same at any AYCE sushi joint now).9. The Himalayas Cocktail (Pink and tastes sweet and delicious) Attention: You must try the Maple Toffee Pudding. I've ALSO tried bits and pieces of their Game Burger and their roasted deer during Taste of Toronto.  Everything I've mentioned tastes like 100%. (The Maple Toffee Pudding maybe 100.1%.) I personally would choose the Duck Breast for you, but I think they're most known for their Spice Ash Crusted Rack of Deer.And because yours annoying truly takes pictures of almost all the foods she eats, I've uploaded pictures of most of the items I've listed above. I will try my best to eat all the items in Antler during my life here in Toronto. Of course, no restaurant is perfect. Some things to consider:1. $$$$$$$$. If you want to enjoy a drink, an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert, you're looking at an upwards of $50 for sure. The last time I came here, the bill came out to be around $110 in total for me and my boyfriend combined. 2. Make reservations ahead of time because the restaurant has limited table space. The first time I came here, my friend and I got seated at the bar. The second time, I got seated at the bar-like tables facing the windows. I asked really politely the third time, and they gave me a table. (I almost got stuck at the bar again.) If you keep those two things in mind, you're bound to have a FRUITFUL time and meal. TLDR; COME EAT HERE. TRY OUT WILD FOODS.",4.0,5.0,105,2017-07-05,43.649718,-79.430604,Canadian (New)
Antler Kitchen & Bar,"Came here for a late birthday dinner on a Saturday night. We reserved for 7:15PM but arrived at 7. Luckily they were able to accomodate us. However, they reserved seats at the BAR for us .... Which was odd considering the restaurant was only around half full with regular tables available. Those were later given to walk-in customers. It wasnt too big of a deal though but I'd recommend to be specific about where you would like to sit or else they will just place you at the bar. I was excited to try the unique meats that Antler served as it would be my first time trying deer and bison and such. We ordered wild boar fried gyoza ($11), venison tartare ($18), rack of deer ($44), and the bison flank steak ($30). Everything tasted awesome, the gyoza was yummy and didnt actually have a game-y taste, it basically tasted like pork. The tartare was awesome! Delicious and nicely mixed with the raw egg. As for the mains, the deer did taste a bit different but still similar to beef. It had more a chalky texture, similar to liver if that makes sense. The green paste underneath the meat tasted really flavourful and unique, Im still not sure exactly what it was but Im glad i tried it! I sort of wish there was more meat in the portion, especially compared to the bison which had a lot more meat but costs significantly less. The bison was my partner's dish but I managed to get a taste of it and it was cooked to perfection and of course, very very similar to beef but still a nice change in cuisine! We also got the antler sangria ($8) and another cocktail for i think $15. I can't remember the name but it was quite fruity and had japanese liquer in it. We also tried the cedar shaved ice with blueberry for dessert which was a very unique taste. It reminds me of an air freshener haha but not in an unpleasant way. I'd say to give this a try! Overall, a quaint restaurant serving unique cusine in Parkdale with attentive, friendly staff. Great for a date night or an experience to try some unique cuts of meat.",4.0,4.0,105,2017-08-03,43.649718,-79.430604,Canadian (New)

Antler Kitchen & Bar,"I would call this 'forest to table' eating.  The meats are gamingly deliciousness (Yes, I make up words when I get excited about chomping on good food).

Spice Ash Crusted Rack of Deer - the chef's signature dish. It's served with braised neck, parsnip purée (so yummy), and swiss chardBest cocktail on the menu and one of the best in the city - the Smoked Barrel! Scotch (yess!) chocolate bitter (sweet!) maple syrup (Canadian eh?!) and the best part - a cinnamon smoked glass (fancy!)If going as a pair I highly recommend reserving the chef's table - it is the only seats that looks right into the kitchen and they often give you extra goodies to sample.",4.0,4.0,105,2017-01-13,43.649718,-79.430604,Canadian (New)
Antler Kitchen & Bar,"One time for Yelp guiding me to this hidden treasure. We were leaving Caribana and looking for a great meal to finish the night. Everything in the nearby vicinity of Lake Shore was jam packed with crowds leaving. That's when we realized we needed to get away from the area. A quick look at the photos of food from Antler and I was sold.The street that it sits on is not a restaurant hotspot. It looked like the typical local neighborhood, with dry cleaners and fast food. Inside was another story. Great atmosphere, dim lighting, and early 90s-mid 2000 hip hop/r&b playing. That's all I could hope for. Then the hostess asked if we had reservations and we were instantly deflated. Luckily there was space at the bar and we were seated immediately.The bartender (who made a perfect old-fashioned and instantly gained all credibility) walked us through the menu and his favorite selections. Most of his choices aligned with ours and was affirmation of our yelp photo scanning skills. We decided to share plates and  the Wild Boar Gyoza (pot stickers for us less cultured folks) were a nice starter. I preferred them without the accompanying soy sauce, so the flavor isn't drowned. Next we had the pappardelle pasta with rabbit and apricots. Oh my...I wasn't ready. I should have been prepared for how good this tastes but I wasn't. I blame myself for years of ordering pasta with red sauce. We finished off the food order with the Bison flank steak and frites. And by finished I mean I wasn't hungry but I still finished because it was that dang good. If you have the chance, you owe it to yourself to get here.

Antler Kitchen & Bar,"Brunch 5 starsDinner 4 starsOverall is 4.5 stars My first review is of the brunch experience which is worthy of the trek to Dundas West!  Definitely well done and food is great.  Dinner is also good here... would it compare to my other 5s (Buca, Boralia, and Grey Gardens), not quite but that shouldn't take away from the fact I did like my dinner here.Similar to brunch, the dinner menu incorporates game meats and local vegetables to craft up an interesting menu where have lots of interesting choices as a carnivore or vegetarian.  There are GF free options here too so they're on point for noticing different dietary needs.Service here was casual and friendly... a tad less attentive than our perfect service at brunch but still good nevertheless.We decided to order 3 appetizers and 2 entrees with a very good cherry based cider from a local brand West Avenue.  Pacing of the appetizer was nearly rapid fire where all 3 came within minutes of each other and we didn't clear the first apps before the another one arrived.  Venison Jamaican Patty - An interesting twist to the Jamaican patty where I get flashbacks to university days of dried out patties sat in the cafeteria.  Well Antler puts that old memory aside!  Tender crust houses a moist and flavourful venison that would surprise most people as it not dry or gamey.  I know some people think game meat is pungent or too lean.  Not here!  The venison is bordering on a tad too soft but I'm wondering if its cause it has a decent amount of sauce in it?  The scotch bonnet sauce that comes with it is REALLY good.  The patty is a solid 4 but the sauce is so good that I wanted to dip everything in it.  So I'm bumping this up to a 4.5/5 Tomato tarte tatin - Tarte tatin is usually a dessert on menus so was quite interesting to see this take.  It is with smoked fior di latte, 2 types of tomatos (a heartier heirloom tomato and the sweeter smaller cherry tomato), pickled onions, and a pastry base.  Someone commented how its almost like a pizza and I have to agree... if France took a pizza and made it their own, this is possibly how they would do it.  When you put all the components together, it made for a nice bite.  The pickled onion cut through the gooey richer cheese while the 2 types of tomatoes gave a nice sweetness and lighter vegetal acidity... alllll on top of a flakier crust.  I do recommend eating this one a bit quicker cause the tomato are just exploding in tomato juice and makes the pastry become a west sponge later.  Another little note, the components are all plated nicely in their own section of the tarte... It made it harder to get all the components in one bite without mushing up the entire tart.  4/5Sweet Potato Gyoza - Pan fried dumplings that had mashed sweet potato with their own sake soya sauce blend to dip.  I'm not gonna lie, the gyoza tasted better with the scotch bonnet sauce from the Jamaican Patty.  It really needed that kick of flavour to make this one be better.  Still from a cooking perspective, nicely crisp dumpling skin so it's well executed.  3.5/5Farmer's Market Vegetarian Gnocchi - This was explained as being a Parisian gnocchi made with ricotta to add lightness instead of the usual potato and flour combo.  I've made ricotta gnocchi Parisian style at home and normally they're pan fried with butter at the last moment.  These weren't so I'm not sure how these are Parisian.  Also these were much denser and chewier than my own ricotta gnocchi.  Aside from those 2 issues, the dish had a decent variety of different vegetables, it had pattypan squash (squat and tiny squashes that look like fancy spinning tops), asparagus, zucchini, radishes, and some sauteed greens (broccolini?).  It's all brought together with a good pesto.  This is a decent dish but could have been elevated a bit more by having the gnocchi lighter and actually be pan fried Parisian style 3.5/5Bison Flank Steak - This is a good looking plate with a really nice flank steak.  Similar story to the venison, there's no gamey flavour.  It is leaner cause it is game meat but flank steak is normally lean anyhow.  They cooked it really nicely to a medium and I would say that they did an great job on it.  Juicy and tender and making good use of the red wine jus to up the flavour.  It came with a smear of creamy polenta, fresh peas, mushrooms, and a few sprigs of sauteed broccolini.  I felt the bison flavour was fairly mild so it really needed the red wine jus... it could have perhaps benefited more of a stronger flavour sauce.  Comparing this to another game steak (Elk at Boralia), this was good but just didn't have the flavour pop as much. 4/5Overall, this is a good place to enjoy a dinner that shows a bit of Canadiana and an excellent place for brunch.  Service can be good to great and just adds to the overall nice atmosphere this place brings.  Definitely grab a spot for brunch!",4.0,4.0,105,2017-07-07,43.649718,-79.430604,Canadian (New)
Antler Kitchen & Bar,Well worth the long walk from downtown. While the wild boar gyoza was just OK (should have picked the sweet potato) the Cornish Hen was cooked perfectly. Just the right amount of crunch on the skin yet moist and tender inside. And the accompanying veggies were almost better than the meat. The Antler beer brewed specially for them had a nice touch of smoked wood once you let it warm up a bit.  Will definitely visit again to try more entrees.

Antler Kitchen & Bar,"Antler is a restaurant that specializes in game meat. If you do not like game meat, you will not like Antler. It's also not a restaurant for vegetarians.  If you enjoy game meat, then Antler is a great restaurant for you to try.  We tried the boar ragu which came with tomato braised wild boar, parmesan and basil ($26). It was delicious. The cavatelli was fresh and cooked well (al dente) and paired well with the boar meat.  We also tried the roasted duck breast ($35) which was cooked medium rare to perfection. The service was attentive. The atmosphere was modern with a touch of rustic vibe. The prices are a bit high for the portions. The prices charged seemed like prices that one would expect of a restaurant in the financial district.

Antler Kitchen & Bar,"Well how do you get more Canadian than au pied de cochon (refer to last review)... you don'tBut you definitely try at Antler kitchen and bar. When looking at the menu, you get the sense you hunted/gathered everything yourself (you didn't) because everything comes from products that are proudly Ontario/Canadian Venison tartare: something about raw diced deer meat makes me feel like a kid again (apologies to Bambi). Seasoning was just right, very plain and simple, letting you taste the fresh flavours of the deer. Rack of Venison: a damn good looking dish. Perfectly cooked on a charcoal grill but really tiny. Like I know deers have more than one rib.. give it to me already. Spice also takes away a lot of the gamey flavour of the deer, but it gives it a nice crust. Served on a bed of mash peas and braised deer shoulder, which has the same texture as pulled pork tbhBison ribeye: well kill me now and put me in a coffin. Hands down better than any beef ribeye Ive had in a steakhouse. Holy moly, and if you get it with the foie gras, it just adds another level of ecstasy to the dish. Very nicely salted and charred on a charcoal grill to allows for the crusty shell on the outside.

Poke Guys,"Since the poke / bowl trend is so popular now, I decided to check out this small poke restaurant as I walked back along Dundas street in the early evening.  I was curious to see how the poke bowls here in Toronto compared with those back home!Atmosphere: 3/5  This is a small convenient restaurant located just off Dundas st close to university.  There were only a few tables and not very busy when I visited during the early evening hours.  Overall probably too small to sit comfortably for a standard meal and most people tend to take out, but simple and no-nonsense.Food: 4/5  I love the fresh taste and variety of ingredients in a poke bowl, and there was no exception here.  I ended up creating my own large bowl of brown rice / greens, with classic salmon as the protein and corn, seaweed salad, masago, edamame, tomatoes, green onions as toppings.  I esp liked the small amount of flavoring and chewy texture of the brown rice!  Good portion size   Service: 3.5/5  Efficient and friendlyPrice: 2/5  Unfortunately, this bowl was more expensive than I expected, perhaps because I was not used to the additional PST!  Another thing that bothered me was that I had to pay for each topping, and even the large bowl only came with one protein option.  As a result, it was a little difficult to estimate the cost of the bowl until the end.Overall: 3/5  The ingredients were great and I enjoyed my poke bowl as always, however the space was a little small in this restaurant and the pricing scheme seemed a little less friendly compared with what I was used to.  I would still recommend trying out the bowls here though!",4.0,3.0,275,2017-11-09,43.654836,-79.385182,"Hawaiian , Poke"

Poke Guys,"DELIVERY REVIEW: via UberEATSPoke Guys is one of my top choices for poke in DT Toronto. The portions are fair for the price, the fish is fresh, and the optionality of the different bases is great. It allows you to be a little healthier by substituting the white rice for brown rice or spring mix instead. It's a go-to place for me when I want sushi, but without the copious amounts of rice.While they have standard bowls which are tasty, you also have the option to build your own bowl if you choose to. The large size bowl is an extra $4.50 on UberEATS and it's well worth it. At least for my order, there was way more than $4.50 worth of fish in the larger one.My favourite of the standard bowls is the Cali Bowl - I usually eat it with no sauce since the salmon and tuna are already tossed in a sauce.In comparison to some other poke places I've tried, the ingredients including the fish here are definitely fresher than most!",4.0,4.0,275,2017-10-23,43.654836,-79.385182,"Hawaiian , Poke"

It contained salmon, tuna, avocado, nori, masago, imitation crab, fried onions, and topped with sesame seeds. So many of the ingredients that I enjoy. The presentation was excellent. However, I thought the taste of the poke was just okay. I found the flavor to be a bit bland.

Poke Guys,"Poke bowls, gotta try 'em all. After having tried various poke and poke-ish  (places that serve other things as their main thing, but also do poke on the side) spots in Toronto, I've concluded that Poke Guys is the best poke restaurant in the city, and is the one that is the most worth it.I look at four things in poke: flavour, portion, price, location.Flavour. A+. 100%. The many ingredient work well together. The rice is seasoned (some places don't do that!!!!!), the avocado is fresh (once again, some places don't do that!!!), and they don't skimp out on the fish (honestly, one of my biggest pet peeves).Portion. Perfect!!! The regular was just right for me. The large was just right for my tall friends who need more calories.Price. I don't have to sell an organ for a bowl of poke, so that's nice. But seriously, it's cheaper than a lot of the other poke places and the price-to-food ratio is probably the best in the city!Location. It's a little bit further for me, but it's close enough that it's not that big of a deal.Anyway, after my very extensive scientific study of poke restaurants, I conclude that this is the best poke place in Toronto.",4.0,5.0,275,2017-09-22,43.654836,-79.385182,"Hawaiian , Poke"

I got white rice, class shoyu tuna, seaweed salad, cucumber, avocado, and crab meat slaw with spicy aioli (mayo). The regular size was more than enough for me, I still had food left over. The tuna had so much flavor and it was so fresh. I tried the crab meat slaw because everyone was raving about it. I do not like coleslaw, but I did like their take on it.

Mangia & Bevi,"Came here one weeknight without reservation for an early dinner and got a table for 2. The place was not packed and had several small tables available and a few occupied larger tables for a midweek dinner time. Even as the night went by, it wasn't very busy for 6 or 7 o'clock. Service: We had an attentive waitress who watched our side of the tables as we enjoyed and picked at our appetizer and didn't bother us. Since it was a small table for 2, we were not rushed to finish our shared appetizer and not forced to start our main course yet. At first, we were wondering what took our pasta dish so long to arrive since we saw other tables who sat after us receive all their orders. But after asking our waitress about when our pasta would come, she wanted to be sure we were done with our one shared appetizer first.With that being said---- we have perfect HOT AL DENTE pasta!Food: We each ordered a wine by glass (price ranges from $8-11 per glass of red). Appetizer-Grilled octopus - surprisingly, this was rather a large platter to share. It had a large plate of greens (spinach, olives, potatoes, peppers) and topped with a vinaigrette. Between the two of us, we couldn't finish the appetizer (leftover greens)Main- Frutti Di Mare - The pasta was really fresh. Plate was hot enough and we devoured it quickly!! Love the flavours. It was a simple seafood dish with red sauce but we enjoyed it very much. Proportions were great (shared between two people since we were not that hungry- mostly full from the large appetizer). Atmosphere and location: So this place was a little awkward to find. It was hidden away at what looked like a residential/corporate OFFICE type set up. I wasn't sure if I was walking towards the correct plaza since it looked like a residence just based on the parking area (good thing is, I saw there was a parking lot area and a large furniture store). As you enter into the building, it is on the main floor - no need to go up elevators. The place can fit lots of small tables and definitely, if you need private dining, they had a whole area curtained off and secluded. You can also sit at the bar as well (I did see solo diners by the bar area). Good space to hold events for a large group. My friend went to this place for a yelp event before and recommended it. Overall: next time I'd like to try some of the pizza on the menu as well -It looked very appetizing and smelled great from the tables next to us.",4.0,4.0,152,2017-11-17,43.652224,-79.366307,"Italian , Pizza"

I also started with a small arugula salad, and found it to be coated with too much dressing. I have been here before though, and have tried the pizzas which I recall being very very good.

Mangia & Bevi,"This unassuming little gem is full of deliciousness! You walk in the door and the aromas are just a teaser. Every bite was a feast of flavors. The octopus was pretty good, though not spectacular. The pasta and the pizza, however, were super yummy! My only complaint was the limited wine selection, especially when it came to the whites. We were seated at one of the smaller tables and asked to move. (That ""table for four"" was a tight squeeze because the table doesn't really seat four grownups. The party that did sit there could not fit either so someone sat at the head of the table, on the bench next to it... kinda awkward.) I digress...The service was friendly and attentive and  the food was simply excellent!

Mangia & Bevi,"I thought it was amazing because it's been so long since I've let myself go (Italian-style cheat meals are the best). Partner and I came here tonight because I'm currently carb loading for a half marathon this Sunday. We've been here before for brunch only and found the restaurant very heartwarming, welcoming, and romantic with the twinkling, wicker basket style decor. In the warmer season the sidewalk patio is also open. Unfortunately they are located a bit off the downtown core - still super convenient of a short walk from the Financial District (10-15 minutes) with parking spots everywhere. However, might be hard to find for some folks since the front door is located off to the side, not facing King Street East.Food- 3.5/5. Again, how could one not love carbs and fat. Italian is always a favorite. However, after consulting my partner, who actually eats Italian food very often when he goes out, he said the pasta and pizza were only ""ok"". A complimentary bread basket featuring ""nice"" bread and EVOO+BV was given at the start. Many vegetarian options here for pastas and pizzas compared to other Italian places like Mercatto where vegetarians are pretty much stuck ordering the same 1-2 items every time, i.e. margherita pizza. Not vegan friendly though. We ordered the tricolore pasta (vegetarian), which contained white wine braised zucchini, very few roasted cherry tomatoes, red onions, bocconcini (mozzarella), and basil. All of their pastas are homemade and cooked perfectly al dente (gluten-free pasta is also an option but these are store-purchased). Partner said the pasta was mediocre, better than at Mercatto since more veggie toppings and more veggie options, but comparable to Hot House pastas. The fresh mozzarella bits were my absolute favorite - so chewy and no after taste, very fresh. We also ordered the zucchina pizza, featuring tomato sauce, grilled yellow & green zucchini, bufalo ricotta, red onions, and mint. The dough was thin and a bit soggy due to the tomato sauce except at the crust, which was thick and not too hard, cripsy, or bitter like usual pizza crust. I loved the crust omg, chewy and perfectly risen. The ricotta was also perfection.PS. The panini sandwiches (around $10) are only available at lunch, sorry.Value- 4/5. Pretty good value for a romantic, fancy-ish. Mains are between $20-30, but the portion sizes are pretty big and filling unlike at fancier Italian restaurants like Buca.Venue- 4/5. Twinkle, twinkle little star. Lots of space inside with large tables available for group seating. Perfect for large groups actually, but do make a prior reservation. Lost 1 star for being a bit hard to find.Service- 3/5. Very warm staff. However, after serving the food and bringing a jug of water we barely saw them again. No offers of fresh pepper or cheese with our mains, but no big deal.Will be back again, but perhaps after trying a few other Italian restaurants to build up my critic credentials lol",4.0,3.0,152,2017-05-05,43.652224,-79.366307,"Italian , Pizza"

Mangia & Bevi,"I was on the quest to try a great Carbonara pasta so i began my search online and came across Mangia & Bevi from a couple of reviews here on Yelp. I opted for this place due to its convenient location with it being a short walk from my college. Being an Italian Cuisine fanatic i was quite excited to try it out.As i made my treck to the restaurant i made sure to keep my eyes peeled for it because according to other Yelpers who have been there its located in quite a secretive spot. Luckily enough for me i made my way easily there.The restaurant has a little outside seating but unfortunately it was raining and therefore it wouldn't have been ideal to sit outside. Up the stairs you go to a little quaint place. Dimly lit with a couple of tables as well as a bar seating. However , first thing i noticed  or should i say smelled upon entering was the wiff of fresh pizza being made , which made me question what it was that i wanted to order. Was i going to opt out of having pasta and have pizza instead ? I stayed by my words and ordered the pasta. The waitress who served me was quite attentive which would be one of the reasons i gave this place a 5/5 rating. I went ahead and ordered my pasta impatiently waiting as i was quite hungry , but then i was served some bread along with balsamic vinegar and EVOO , i only had some of the bread which mind you tasted fresh and delicious but only negative thing i would say is that they should have added more balsamic vinegar to the EVOOFinally out came my pasta. For those who dont know what Carbonara is its a pasta cooked in egg , cream and pancetta.  First things first , the pasta quality itself was superb , thick and fresh. The sauce was delicious , pancetta to pasta ratio was perfect and so was the sauce its saltiness from the pancetta made this dish perfect and not overwhelmingly salty.I  would definitely come back here next time and go for the pizza !!",4.0,5.0,152,2016-09-17,43.652224,-79.366307,"Italian , Pizza"

Everything smelled delicious which put us in a good mood.My fiancé ordered COMMENDATORE pasta which costed $21 and had sausage, smoked provolone,spinach, leeks, pistachios, and cream. I took (stole) a bite of it, it was creamy and comforting like being wrapped in freshly laundered blankets.With that said, I enjoyed my own pasta immensely better. The actual name of the dish escapes me but it essentially had fusilli with squid and sausage in a spicy tomato sauce. Did it hit the spot? Totally!

Archeo,"Archeo is easy to miss when you are visiting the Distillery District and not specifically looking for it - even though it is right at the main gate entrance to the district, the exterior of this restaurant is so low key that it can easily be mistaken as a gift/clothing shop of some kind. If you do give them a try, you'll find that it is quite a solid restaurant with very reasonable prices given it's at a touristy location.The restaurant has a casual, rustic Italian Trattoria look and feel to it. Service is prompt and delightful. Unlike other restaurants in the area, this place does not have a huge menu selection, but it is well-rounded and thoughtful. With me and 3 other companions, we were able to sample pretty much all of the appetizers and most of the secondi main dishes.The food here is contemporary Italian, so anyone who comes here expecting to taste classic home style Italian cooking would probably be disappointed. Presentation of the dishes here are great, and I found the flavours very interesting.Dishes we had for the evening:- Antipasti with local & house cured meats, housemade pickles, ferments, mustard and cracker- Cannelloni with Chianti braised rabbit, charred carrot puree, and burnt cucumber infusion- Fresh local greens with house ricotta and elderberry caper- Fritto Misto (Maitake mushroom, olive ascolone, dandelion and burnt cucumber emulsion)- Flatiron steak with potatoes, creme fraiche, beet, juniper and glace de veau (this was perfectly seared and was an absolute joy to eat)- Fazzoletti Ripieni with house made Italian sausage, seared Ontario mushrooms, fennel, kumquat and anise truffle nage (this was an awesome dish as well)- Farfelle with rapini, vanilla poached salsify, shallots, garlic confit, garlic pesto cream and preserved lemon- Pappardelle Bolognese with blisted vine tomatoes, white anchovies and smoked olive oil (my favourite pasta of the evening)- Branzino with pan fried sweet gale, crispy skin, brussel sprouts, dandelion greens and elderberry piccata- Piadini Manzo with beef bresaola, sunchoke puree, green olive, pistachio, smoked golden blyth goat gouda (much more interesting and tastier than a pizza!)- Apple cake with brown butter icecream and marsala cream (this was so good, especially the brown butter icecream!)- Vanilla buttermilk panna cotta - Bittersweet chocolate bar with cocoa nibs, raspberry sorbet and strawberry coulis (a very nice and balanced dessert)I truly appreciate Executive Chef Dyer's passion of trying to focus on using as much local ingredients as possible for his dishes. I was also delighted to know that most things are made/prepared in-house, which is always nice.Overall, I am definitely a fan of this place and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone visiting the Distillery District who wants to try good and reasonably priced Italian fare.

How can any trained chef think this is a solid meal?  I say this was a fail! Not vegan friendly.Follow up: The restaurant responded advising me to let them know ""in the moment"" of any disappointments. My issue with that response is that it is very uncomfortable to complain in the presence of other dinner guests. While perhaps there is little that can be done after the fact, and I should be grateful that my review and experience was acknowledged, I stand behind my original comment that the chef should know better. Upon further thought, the restaurant could just accept  a failing and say they will consider a change.  Again, not a good spot for a vegan.",3.0,2.0,55,2016-06-20,43.65068,-79.359526,"Italian , Beer Bar"

Bourbon Street Smokehouse,"I had some high expectations when I saw this restaurant with a 4.5 on yelp. My first time at a smokehouse was going to be a great experience. Did this place meet my expectations? Almost. But they were set very high. We ordered the sampler for two with Salmon, Brisket, St Louis ribs, potato wedges and Mac & cheese. Portion sizes were quite generous - this could have fed 3 people! Seeing as I shared this with one other person - I got lunch for the next day.The brisket was by far my favourite. It was very tender and flavourful on its own, but when I added the Memphis bbq sauce it went to a whole new level. The salmon was an extra charge and it was not great. If I were to return I would not order this again. The Mac & cheese was nothing to write home about, but the potato wedges are a must order! They are soft and crunchy at the same time and are topped with a flavourful seasoning. Some of the best I've had.

Bourbon Street Smokehouse,"I went with a very large group for dinner (14 of us) and we were seated at two long tables. Our server went over the menu with us and explained the various platters and what you get with each one. Four of us decided to go with the family combo of five meats and four sides for $90. I think this was a really great value. For the meats, we chose the St. Louis ribs, pulled pork, Texas brisket, smoked salmon and sausages. For our sides, we chose sweet potato fries, waffle fries, mac & cheese and corn bread. I was not a huge fan of the pork or the brisket, but that's likely due to the style they use. The pork was too 'stringy' for my liking and it was kind of mushy, and as for the brisket, I prefer the kind that is sliced vs. pulled. The salmon was very delicate and not what I'm used to, but I did like the maple flavour. Apparently, they don't prepare the salmon in-house, but they do finish it there. A bit confused as to the reason behind that, but I guess they focus on their meats. I liked the sausage and the ribs best - we all agreed that we should've doubled up on ribs for the amount you get. Not enough for each person in our foursome to have two ribs each, so we had to flip for them! I loved the corn bread! It was a bit sweet, but really moist and served warm. Yum!! Actually, I have no complaints about any of the sides - they were all good!! Probably the best sweet potato fries I've ever had. I also really enjoyed the various sauces they bring to the table. Great variety and such a nice change from just one sauce that most BBQ places offer. Despite not really loving every component of the meal, I was really happy with the service, which is why I bumped them up to four stars. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating for our group, and happy to split bills for us, which can be a hassle at some spots. I would gladly return here for more meaty goodness in the future!!",4.0,4.0,11,2017-09-18,43.661678,-79.426279,"Barbeque , Southern , Smokehouse"
Bourbon Street Smokehouse,"Im a bit of a foodie and I've lived in Toronto all my life, but have never been to a smokehouse. Im glad to that Bourbon Street Smokehouse was my first. I went with two of my foodie friends and we all decided to each get the ""Sampler for One"" meal so we could try a variety of food. ""Sampler for One"" includes 2 mains and 2 sides. I didnt expect the portions to be as big as they were.We all just had to try the Texas Beef Brisket for our first main... you CANNOT go wrong with it! That is a promise!It smells incredible and as for taste.. out of this world!It is so rich in flavour and  melts in your mouth, its kind of an experience you have to live yourself in order to know. Ribs were great, especially because is was brushed with their homemade  BBQ sauce. Sausage was pretty good, but not something I was really wowed by. The sides were AMAZING. Cesar salad... was a Caesar salad but it was elevated with there in-house smoked cheese. Mac and cheese was to die for. Very cheesy and even tasted very smoky. It tasted more smokier than the meats tbh. Don't know if they used a specific cheese, smoked their cheese as they did for the Caesar salad, or added liquid smoke. Beans were delicious and had a nice sweetness to them. Coleslaw.. I can only say that it was good, because I'm more used to a mayonnaise-based coleslaw not a vinegar based one.  They give you a set of sauces; ketchup, mayo, malt vinegar, BUT their home made sauces... SO GOOD!Mississippi BBQ sauce was smoky with a very mild kick to it,  we at first assumed it was the best, since they gave us two full bottles of it, and it was... we finished both bottles. Memphis BBQ sauce was pretty similar to the Mississippi BBQ but slightly sweeter from the pineapple. Didnt try the Carolina Sauce, cause we were too into the first two. White gold, tasted very similar to a caesar dressing but was slightly different, I couldnt put my finger on it. I tried a dot of the Ghost Pepper sauce, the first few seconds were good, but the heat slowly builds. So if you like spicy, this one's for you.  That was the food, but as for service, our server was a little slow in the beginning while taking our orders. Seemed like she was still trying to understand how to place an order on the tablet. That was okay, we were patient enough to wait. But as for the rest of our dining experience, she barely came by our table, but more like looked at us from afar. When we were done with our meal, we asked for to-go containers and the bill. She left and never came back, only clearing half of our table. We tried to patiently wait, but seeing as she pretty much ignored us, because like I said, she would look at us from another table and looked away, we talked to the other waiter. She was very helpful, and gave us whatever we needed within seconds, which made the experience a lot better.Aside from the service from that one server, I definitely recommend trying this place out.

Bourbon Street Smokehouse,"So glad this place is here instead of what was previously there (which I also reviewed and was terrible). This is some of the best barbecue in the city, and luckily close to home! We got the platter for 2 (it served 3 people well), which comes with your choice of 3 meats & 2 sides for $40. The portions are very generous & everything was delicious. We got the: ribs, texas brisket, pulled pork, baked beans, waffle fries & added a side of corn beard (only $4.50). So for $45 you can feed 3 people a decent amount of delicious food. My only reason(s) for not giving this place 5 stars is the service & vibe. They were understaffed so it was a bit slow when it came to drinks, and the bill. I also wish that instead of having a lounge in the back of the restaurant, they would put something more lively back there.

Bourbon Street Smokehouse,"For a place that's been open for about two months, they really know how to please people. Bourbon Street Smokehouse was spotted during a walk back to Ossington Station, and visited a couple of days later. My group was the first set of diners, but more people seemed to come in as we ate, and by the time we left there were a nice amount of tables filled up.To start, there are some excellent drinks available - draught, canned, and bottled - and a list of delicious sounding cocktails. I was limiting myself, so I just got a can of Guinness.My companions shared the ""sampler for one"" (and had trouble finishing that, to give you either an idea of how my friends have small stomachs, or how big the portions are) which consisted of ribs and brisket (their choice out of the options of ribs, two types of brisket, pulled pork, and sausages), while I opted for a full rack of ribs. You're given a choice of two sides for both, so we shared the Waffle Fries, Corn Bread, Macaroni and Cheese, and Baked Beans.MAINSThe Brisket was nice and tender, however, there wasn't much spice on the outside. Adding a bit of sauce definitely helped, but it was rather pleasant - definitely not as overpowering as some. The Ribs on the other hand are cooked incredibly well. They're not fall off the bone juicy, but they are still very tender. The tips of the rack were chewy and a nice treat saved for after the devouring of the main bit.SIDESStarting with the Corn Bread, it's very nice to find a place that does a corn bread that manages to stay pleasantly sweet without being overpowering, and fluffy without practically falling apart in your hands. The edge pieces were just slightly crispy, giving a nice crunch to some of the bites, but the bread itself was succulent.The Waffle Fries were very similar. A crunchy outside with a super fluffy potato inside. Not an abundance of grease or oil either, which was nice on the fingers!The Mac and Cheese noodles were nice and soft, covered in cheese that had melted all the way through. I couldn't pinpoint the cheese, but it was a very unique taste that I didn't often get (and definitely wasn't KD).The beans, I can't really describe aside from delicious. There was such a nice sweetness to them, they weren't too hot, and weren't too cold, and I'm pretty sure I could survive just off them if absolutely necessary.SAUCESWhen you're brought your meats at Bourbon Street, you're also brought a rack of sauces. You have the malt vinegar, mayonnaise, and ketchup and mustard standards, but then you have 6 sauces that each have their own profile.The Smokey BBQ is by far my favourite. It's a good balance of savoury and sweet, and has a nice smokey flavour to it (as it should) that mixes perfectly with their meats. If you had to pick ONE sauce to go with anything on their menu, it would probably be this! (Also, their ribs come out with a light covering of it to encourage people, due to some being scared off by dry rub ribs coming to their table like some places)Their Mississippi BBQ is a nice mild sauce, not much heat to it, with a fairly nice vinegar undertone. It's a good standard BBQ sauce, and pairs well with ribs (and mixes VERY nicely with the smokey BBQ).The Memphis BBQ has nice, sweet undertones, which makes sense, as it's apparently made with pineapple juice! It's got a very mild vinegar aftertaste, but you likely won't get much of it if you're devouring it on the rest of your meal.Their Carolina sauce has a nice, light heat for people who want a bit of kick to their sauce. It's got a stronger vinegar tang to it, but that's the kind I'd like on some nice back ribs to match the tenderness.The ""White Gold"" they offer is more of a side sauce, used for fries and the like. On it's own it's a bit underwhelming, and makes me think of a caesar dressing, but more saucy. Still, it's not bad, and a little bit on ribs is actually surprisingly nice!Finally, they have a Ghost Pepper sauce. Now, before you run away, please note this is not nearly as hot as SOME sauces that use the Bhut Jolokia pepper. It starts off very vinegary, which lulls you into a false sense of security, followed by a build up of that familiar hot kick from the pepper that (for me) lasted about 30 seconds before evening off. I do not recommend brushing your ribs with it, but if you are a serious spice-head, then this is probably the sauce you want to go with. Fun fact: Putting this on the ribs with the smokey bbq was incredible. The sweetness is a great opener to the heat that hits hard.OVERALL VERDICT:Would I recommend Bourbon Street Smokehouse? Of course. It's still finding it's feet, so expect some bumps along the way, but give them a fair shot, you won't be disappointed. Just steps from Ossington Station, too - which is an excellent location!",4.0,5.0,11,2017-06-07,43.661678,-79.426279,"Barbeque , Southern , Smokehouse"

Union Social Eatery,"I believe this place has the best burgers in the city. The service is usually satisfactory (no one would accuse this place of being fast, even at the best of times). The main issue with the restaurant is that it is extremely loud. Due to is last fact, my wife and I usually order take out these days. Today the service was exceptionally slow. Due in no small part to the bartender who was in shift today. I witnessed several people waiting for 10 minutes or more for a simple drink. I myself was required to wait 30 minutes (in addition to the expected 20 minutes). Apparently there was some mixup with my order and as a result, my wife's entree was not included. In an attempt to prove that the error was not his, the bartender decided it was a good idea to go digging into the garbage to find the paper record of the order. The first time he did this, he managed to half heartedly was his hands before returning to making drinks. The second time he dug into the garbage he thought better of the washing and returned directly to serving customers.After sitting at the bar for 30 minutes with my entree, my wife's food was ready.

Union Social Eatery,"3.5 I'd say! Had dinner here tonight and enjoyed my meal! The restaurant is really cool inside, looks like it once was a garage converted restaurant with an industrial-meets-urban look to it. I'd consider the food to be pub food with some elevated items. Price point is decent, a bit high for a regular weekday meal i'd say, however. I tried their feature fish sandwich which appears to change daily. Today was a grilled Arctic char with a soy or sesame glaze, topped with some coleslaw in a soft burger bun. I enjoyed the sandwich, the flavour was good and the mountain of fries they give you are great, too much for one person though. I wonder if anyone ever finishes those fries! I also shared the calamari and that was decent as well. I enjoyed the Thai chili sauce that came with it. I also tried the chicken strips which were a bit more upscale with the almond breading. These were not bad, however not outstanding in my opinion. I felt as thought every dish was maybe missing or lacking something, nothing was extraordinary to me, unfortunately. I would maybe like to try the Penang curry bowl next time, I saw a few people with that and it looked great. The service was decent, a bit slow at times which was a bit strange for a Tuesday evening and it wasn't even that busy. Our food took quite a while to come but we weren't in a rush so it was ok. We had upgraded our fries to the truffle fries and that was missing once we got our meal, we let a server know and this was fixed immediately which was good. The restaurant is a nice big space. Lots of tables and on a nice day, the 'garage' doors were open so a nice breeze was coming in. The restaurant is warmly decorated with lots of dark wood furnishings and retro light fixtures. I would maybe come again with some friends if they wanted to go but probably wouldn't be rushing out to eat here next time I'm hungry!",4.0,3.0,119,2017-07-18,43.687795,-79.395069,"American (Traditional) , Canadian (New)"
Union Social Eatery,"After passing by this place for a while I thought it was finally time to check it out.  To say I was underwhelmed is an understatement.  the decor is nice but don't expect to have a conversation here because it is loud.  I couldn't hear what the people at my table were saying and it felt like i was screaming.  There are 4-5 tvs here so of course it is going to be loud but I still like to be able to hear what the person is saying who is seated next to me.While none of us were really hungry we decided to ordered a few apps - the trio of hummus dip; the smashed avocado dip and the vegetarian flatbread.The hummus came with tortilla chips and pita bread and actually was pretty good.  The different types of hummus were really flavourful.  This was the best of the apps in my opinion from what we ordered.The flatbread - not my thing.  The bread was hard, it was drizzled with balsamic vinegar (well maybe doused was a better word) and just fell flat (no pun intended..lol).The smashed avocado dip wasn't too bad - but definitely a share dish as this would be too big for one person to eat.  The service was fine - our server was really nice but I don't think I would come back here.  If the apps weren't great I am not that curious to find out how the mains would taste.Definitely a social place but other than that",4.0,2.0,119,2016-11-13,43.687795,-79.395069,"American (Traditional) , Canadian (New)"

Union Social Eatery,"I've been here a few times over the past 2 years and it's been hit-or-miss. I'd say this is a good place for drinks and snacks, but I'd think twice before ordering a full meal. Food: pricey for what it is (glorified pub food), but overall pretty decent if you go for the classics. Their braised rib firecrackers are amazing. Their sandwiches/burgers are pretty good. I've gotten a curry noodle dish there before and it was extremely salty and just not good. This place does best with standard pub fare, IMO. I have been here for brunch once and the serving sizes were very small. The meal I ordered (eggs benny with pancetta) came out with bacon in place of pancetta. Wouldn't recommend for brunch.

Our server was generally pleasant, although she became pretty impatient when a friend of mine asked two questions about an item on the menu. As for the quality of the food, it really is quite average (like say, Pickle Barrel). The ""Killer Chicken"" burger I ordered had a very thin and dry chicken patty. Then, one of my friends found three hairs on her fish and chips (one of which was actually in the batter of her fish...)

Wilbur Mexicana,"Came here with a group at lunch, and this place gets busy, but the line moves relatively fast. Seating is limited, but I think it's a grab and go for a lot of the customers. My group ordered guac and chops to start, the chips were fresh, and so was the guac (though to be fair, you can't plate bagged guac if it's its own dish). I ordered a burrito, which was basically the size of my forearm, and it came with more chips! The burrito had fresh ingredients and they didn't skimp on the protein. Everything tasted great too! The most exciting thing for me was the salsa bar, where you could sample a medley of different salsas, and add them to your order AT NO EXTRA COST (yes, this matters to me...).The ambiance is higher end than most burritos places, but still has a nice fast pace, so it isn't weird to grab and go with your food.

Chicken Tinga, pork and of course fish. Oh my god....service is fast. My favourite part here is what I like to call the accessories bar. Can't argue with all the fixins you can add. I loved it. That section of hot sauce is insane. While you wait set yourself with what you'd like to add on to your tacos. It was great. My dream addition would be fresh guacamole. The chicken and pork were delicious but the fish taco was not my favourite. Sadly, I didn't finish that one. I tried covering it with as much of the pico de Gallo, salsa verde and lime.

Wilbur Mexicana,"Came to Wilbur on a Wednesday night.  As I I hadn't been here previously, I walked in saw a staff member and mentioned I wanted take-out.  Fortunately I was next in line and was able to order up right away.  I decided I'd go for the Wilbur-rito bowl with Chicken.  Paid for my order and asked the gal if there was an area to wait.  She indicated I could just sit right near her at the counter.  I also asked how long it would take, she said maybe 10 mins.  Within 2 mins a gal came with my order.  Holy Guacamole !  That was fast !  Got the Bowl back to my hotel... Holy Guacamole again !  This is solidly good food !  The Chicken was grilled with a nice spice.  Rice, beans, cabbage, and even the guacamole was very fresh and still piping hot ! (not the guacamole).   Overall,  Good ordering experience although when I started writing this review, I noticed others that talk about the salsa bar, and I wasn't told anything about this when I ordered.  I would have liked to have tried some of the salsa offerings.  I also noticed that when I was leaving, the queue to order was rather large.  I luckily got in before a rush.  I liked what I had and will definitely make the trek over there again !",4.0,4.0,384,2017-11-01,43.644877,-79.398798,Mexican
Wilbur Mexicana,"Wow! Just wow! There are good vibes everywhere when you're at Wilbur.  My boss had wanted to take the company to Wilbur for quite some time now, but the long lineups just didn't gel with our schedules at the time. Wilbur, with its high capacity seating,  is always buzzing with diners. Always, especially during prime lunch time, when you'll be lucky to get seating and when the line goes out the door and around the corner (the workers are quick, mind you).  I advise going before 11:30 am and after 1:30 pm when the restaurant is about half full with enough empty seats to save you from scrambling for a spot. We ordered three types of tacos: Carne Asada,  pork, and fish.  All were a gastric journey of their own.  There is a plethora of salsas and sauces to further garnish your food, but the tacos were delightful to the palette even without them.  Texture-wise, they hit the spot and they weren't too runny from the  meat juices and sauces that already constituted them.  Having juices run down my hands while I eat tacos is not the best feeling in the world, so Wilbur has mastered serving tacos full of flavour without the mess!  For the flavour, reasonable price, and low need to hoard napkins, Wilburs' tacos have earned a spot among my top two within the GTA. Furthermore, if you're a regular, which you should be, don't skimp out on the wide array of salsas and sauces available.  There will be a condiment for every mood, including a refreshing pineapple salsa!  Major props to them for the myriad of additional flavours you can spin into your bowl, fajita, taco, or quesadilla for an extra personal touch!Now, decor-wise, there is a hip functionality to the interior. It honestly looks like a fast food restaurant with a modern, new generational twist.  For such a highly frequented spot, the workers keep it well polished; you won't find yourself reeling from uncleared tables and dirty chairs. Also, the music they play in the background isn't overpowering and adds a nice vibe.  You may even catch some live music from time to time.  To be frank, yes, I give it two thumbs up for any causal lunch/dinner date! My final word: Go to Wilbur and enjoy those happy vibes!",4.0,5.0,384,2017-10-05,43.644877,-79.398798,Mexican
Wilbur Mexicana,"I think what has stayed in mind about this place is the following:1. the help-yourself salsa bar that ranges from mild to fire in your hole levels of spiciness and flavours.  The pineapple habenero salsa was great even though it burnt the heck out of my mouth.2. the shelf of wild and extremely hot sauces to put in your food.  I had a lot of fun just looking at all the ridiculous names that people give to their hot sauces.  Needless to say that all of them will make your tummy turn if you are not prepared or experienced in eating these crazy sauces.Wilbur Mexicana is a great fast upscale casual Mexican place in the bustling King St Fashion district.  The place was packed and with good reason.  The chips with guac was good and the guac was chunky, fresh, and vibrant.  I helped myself to their all-you-can-withstand salsa bar.The tacos were super solid and the chicken tinga and the pork was a great choice.  We chatted with a server and they recommended these as it was their best sellers.  They were flavourful and a healthy size so that made me happy.  The dining space is clean with a mix of high-top tables as well as traditional sit-downs.The place as abuzz with activity on a Sunday afternoon and with the weather beaming outside.Wilbur Mexicana is a great spot for a quick and tasty meal before heading out on a night on the town but stay away from the more insane hot sauces if you wanna live throughout the night.

The server told us that three tacos would fill us up, however we found that getting two and sharing a tray was more than enough. There was plenty of fish meat in our tacos and they were packed with sauce and tomato. It also helped that this establishment provides multiple complimentary sauces on the side, so it stuffed us up pretty nicely.

I like how the glass bottles drinks are displayed at the counter sitting in an ice bed. It is also nice because when you dine in they deliver your food to you.The carne asada was a bit spicy.

They have on tap Paloma and margaritas, as well as beer and other non alcoholic drinks to choose from. The menu is pretty diverse offering fajitas, tacos, appetizers and salads. I ordered the taco salad and customized it by removing the rice and dairy (sour cream and cheese). I also added chicken to the salad. Shortly after ordering (about 5 minutes later), the food arrived at our table. The salad was no doubt amazing, and the chicken had a tasty Cajun spice flavour to it. I paid a visit to their salsa bar (complimentary) and chose to add the mango habanero salsa to the salad to make it a bit spicier. The overall experience was great!

White Brick Kitchen,Glad I had the fried chicken. Really good. I couldn't touch it for 10-15 minutes cause it was so hot! Freshly made. Crispy skin reminds me of Popeyes chicken but better and not oily at all! Now I know better cause I ordered chicken at the stockyards and it was oily compared to this one.My sister had the burger. Was good. She found it rich. I don't know if they butter the bun or something. It was good but she couldn't finish it.Fries were awesome! But you have to like black pepper as it is sprinkled on liberally.Coleslaw was only meh. It was ok but nothing special.Worth going back for the chicken. I had their house sauce.

White Brick Kitchen,"Brunch with friends seems like the perfect end to a few weeks off.  I've heard lots of positive things about this restauarnt and have passed by numerous times so I was excited to try it out finally.This place is tiny (narrow) and there always appears to be a line up.  Unfortunately there isn't anywhere to line up.  If you wait here you are literally in everyone's way.  Constantly having to do the ""excuse me dance"".  Also, I don't like people all crammed up by my table overlooking my food...lol.Luckily we didn't have to wait too long and got a table in the middle of the restaurant.  There are a few small tables at the front, however if you want the constant blast of cold air from the door opening then sit here.  If not, ask to sit further back.Our server was really friendly and made suggestions when we asked for recommendations.  I asked for the fried chicken benny with a side of beans (you can choose beans, fries, salad) and wanted to know if they could poach the eggs hard (any one that knows me knows i don't like egg porn).  The eggs came out perfectly.  The fried chicken was ok - I wish it had more...something....spice perhaps.  But it was nice and hot and crispy so that was good.  We had to ask for hot sauce on the side.  It came in a tiny cup.  The beans were slighlty too sweet for my liking.Overall it was an ok brunch.  The grapefruit mango mimosa is stuff you would write home about - the tartness of the grapefruit married with the sweetness of the mango - delicious.  I'd like to come back and try their dinner menu :)",4.0,3.0,190,2018-01-09,43.664176,-79.414961,Comfort Food
White Brick Kitchen,"White Brick Kitchen is located on the south west corner of Euclid and Bloor West between Christie and Bathurst stations on the Bloor subway line.Toronto has their fair share of places where people are willing to line up and wait for brunch on the weekend and don't take reservations because really, they don't have to.  WBK is one of those places.On a very cold Sunday I arrived around 10:40ish to see that there were 3 groups of 3 or more in front of me.  A person came in looking for a table of two and was seated immediately.  All of the seating in this place is only 2 or 4 seat tables.  There was one table at the front window that can seat 5.Upon check in I was given the choice of leaving my number for my place in line or just to wait there.  The place and the list is simply written down at the front counter.  Anybody can see it.  That's how I knew how many were ahead of me and I was given the option to leave my number so I could leave and come back but since it was so cold outside, no - I wasn't going to take a stroll to Christie Pits.  It became crowded pretty fast.They have a curtain at the doorway leading to the entrance so it sort of helps keep the heat in when the cold wanted to creep in.  It became awkward however when more people started to show up and line up inside because it was cramped.  Understandingly so nobody wants to be outside when it was this cold on a day like that.  Still, the staff here are great, friendly and accommodating.  Anybody observing to can how challenging it is to move around in this space and when there's people waiting sort of impeding the way to tables it makes the degree of difficulty even more.The food is the reason people are lined up and coming in however.  Brunch is not something that is taken lightly.  You can get breakfast anywhere really but weekend mornings are a bit different.Brunch = drinks (alcohol) served strictly after 11am.  I watched while waiting in line as beer was being poured and had to sit there until the big hand hit the 12 and it became 11am.  Now it's legal!So between beer, mimosas and Caesars, I ended up getting the large Caesar which they make with 2oz of Stoli and rim the glass with steak spice instead of celery salt which is a nice change actually.The Caesar wasn't as spicy as I was expecting but it had a good taste, mild but the steak spice rim was more like a salt and pepper type season rather than a hot pepper overall tang.  Still good, just different.  Just a pickle on top, nothing wacky or different, just standard.I ended up ordering the 8 piece chicken (tenders) and waffles with a side of bacon and real maple syrup.  I would have preferred real pieces of fried chicken but it isn't offered for breakfast.  The chicken was battered, seasoned but nothing standout-ish.  I mean the chicken seemed just plain Jane standard, not spicy and sort of bland.  It was good but just good.  It wasn't as risky as say the Stockyard's offering.  My friend had asked for some hot sauce and I thought they'd bring a bottle but it was a tiny paper cup with maybe 5ml in it.  He didn't use it all and I used some of it to spark up my chicken just a tad.I was sort of disappointed I had to ask for and pay for maple syrup (2 bucks).  I mean this is chicken and waffles and we're in Canada.  I'm not really interested in Aunt Jemima's or some sort of maple syrup alternative.  Not to mention this dish is almost 20 bucks.  As for the side of bacon the pieces weren't measly small greasy diner type bacon but it was only 2 slices and it was 4 bucks.  Emma's I believe uses Sanagan's meat at least for the pepperette they do.The waffle was good and light but it was sort of small, maybe 6 inches in diameter?  It wasn't very thick either.Overall the service is really good at WBK.  The chicken and waffles I have to say for me was mediocre.  While the chicken (8 tenders around 4 inches long each) was decently abundant it didn't wow me.  I need to be wowed because I'm sort of a lover of fried chicken.  The waffle while good was lacking in overall quantity.  There was no butter offered and the maple syrup had to be paid for which is sort of a turn off.  I suppose I could have asked for butter but I didn't necessarily need it.  I would have used it if it came.  I can't say that I've ever paid 2 dollars for a slice of bacon (x 2) ever and the Caesar while tasty wasn't as spicy as I was hoping for or expecting.WBK is a good place.  I've had others tell me tales of how good this or that is, mainly the chicken.  While I didn't have a chance to get bone in chicken pieces these tenders that came with the chicken and waffles for me were just meh.Overall I can't say I was too impressed with this place but then again I've only had one sit down there.  For a place that's known for their fried chicken and it seems to be talked about a lot - honestly I just don't see it.",4.0,3.0,190,2018-01-09,43.664176,-79.414961,Comfort Food
White Brick Kitchen,"Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict, only available at Sunday brunch, is a dish worth lining up for at this cute little comfort-food cafe. The chicken is supremely crisp and delicious, and pairs perfectly with poached eggs and rich Hollandaise, all perched on a toasted-till-crunchy Scottish bap bun. I upgraded my fries to a poutine for an extra $1.50 (no brainer) and washed it all down with a killer Vanilla Bourbon Milkshake. I strongly recommend the boozy shake, but not sure I needed the poutine. Fries alone would have been plenty.Dave ordered the classic fried chicken sandwich, served with lettuce and an ample helping of mayo and hot sauce. I took a few bites of it and gotta say, the fried chicken shines brighter in the benny. First, the sandwich arrived slightly soggy and became more so with each bite, thus diminishing the crispiness of the chicken. So if you're keen on fried bird during non-brunching hours I'd probably opt for the fried chicken dinner, with sauce on side.",4.0,4.0,190,2017-11-06,43.664176,-79.414961,Comfort Food

It is topped with lettuce, brown butter mayo and hot sauce that enhances the flavours. I opted for fries as a side and they were very tasty and well seasoned. My fiancé ordered the fried chicken benny which was great. The same fried chicken topped with 2 poached eggs and a brown butter hollandaise.

White Brick Kitchen,"Sooooooooooo GOOOOOOOOD!!!!I was just passing by this place long back, read ""Best Chicken in Town"" and laughed out thinking how could someone claim that they are the best in the city when there are so many great fried chicken restaurants here. Decided to visit this place to check it out.After having their food all they claim is nothing but TRUTH!!Ordered 4 Cheese Mac 'n Cheese, Buttermilk Fried Chicken with their Thai chilli sauce (Yes! you have to order it seperately) and Poutine. For the drinks we ordered Beef Salami Caesar and Orange Creamsicle. Beef Salami Caesar was amazing. Though I don't drink that often but believe me Beef Salami Caesar is one of the best cocktails I've had so far. My husband also enjoyed his drink and said the same about his drink too.All the dishes were mind blowingly good. Mac n' Cheese was the best I've had so far. It was topped with Ritz Crackers and was served with delicious garlic bread. It had the perfect proportion of the sauce, cheese and crunch. Fried Chicken came with Biscuit. Chicken had the right kind of crunch and was super juicy inside. Cooked to Perfection! Biscuit was as good as it can get, buttery with the right kind of softness it should have from the inside. Poutine was amazing too I think they make their brown sauce in house and that's what made it even more yumm!Will definitely go back to this place as it has become one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto.",4.0,5.0,190,2017-08-31,43.664176,-79.414961,Comfort Food
White Brick Kitchen,"This has been on my list of places to go for a while now. So for early dinner with a friend we decided to come in for some chicken and waffles! Let me start by saying, this restaurant sticks out as it is in the middle of koreatown. And I've always been curious as to why its survived long after its neighboring stores have closed down and reopened to whatever they are today. Now I have my answer. Servers were friendly and attentive, food came fast and was delicious (we were the only ones there on a Wednesday at 4pm) and place was nice.Now lets break it down: we came in and the place looked very relaxed. The kind of place you can just sit with someone and talk. No loud music, enough space so you arent elbow to elbow with the person next to you. The servers promptly seated us, got our orders and I swear set the food and drinks down almost as fast. The drink I had was pretty meh. Too sweet. I had their version of the dark and stormy (Apparently they cant use the name due to copyright issues.) So moving on to the food... Chicken and waffles... Spicy for this girl. The food was so fresh. Chicken was juicy and tender and crispy and everything you could want in a fried chicken. The waffles were crunchy and fluffly. The combination was amazing. That was one meal I really enjoyed. Will definitely go back. I really want to try the rest of the menu.",4.0,4.0,190,2017-08-18,43.664176,-79.414961,Comfort Food
White Brick Kitchen,"My party of 3 came right at 11AM, the opening time and was seated immediately. Honestly had we came 15 mins later we would've had to wait in line. The line this morning wasn't too bad, maybe because it's Saturday so no brunch menu and the weather was so chilly. Yes, much to my dismay brunch is only offered on Sundays (goodbye egg Benny's and french toast). However, they do offer their excellent mains, i.e. chicken waffles, and breakfast menu every single day.Food- 3/5. I think I'm getting pickier with brunch foods. Normally I would've rated the food here at least 4/5, but after having brunch at Insomnia just a block east and getting into a healthier craze lately, I could only give 3 stars. I'm disappointed with the scarcity of vegetarian and vegan friendly options here. WBK is a cozier, less franchised version of American comfort food, like Denny's. So, lots of meat, waffles, fried potatoes, and grease. Interestingly there's not a lot of egg breakfast options and definitely no seafood. For a pescatarian this was devastating.I ordered their only vegan main - the vegetable curry, which contained raisins, onion, tomatoes, celery, big almonds, etc and came with loose rice and a papadum. Flavor-wise, it was delicious! Not spicy at all and not super strongly seasoned as ethnic curries can be, but very nourishing and vegetable-heavy, which is amazing inside this establishment of greasy bacon and fries. My friends ordered the classic breakfast platter of 4 choices and the chicken and waffles, which comes with one sauce of choice (+$2 for extra sauces), which was gigantic and according to them the chicken was perfectly fried. The fried potato slices in the breakfast platter was such a perfect balance between crispy and chewy - highly recommend! Her fried eggs were really greasy though and the salad greens were really boring, literally just leaves and dressing.Sad, limited dessert options. Come here for the savory and oily, not for sweets.Value- 3.5/5. Moderately pricy for breakfast with entrees around $15-20, but big portions.Service- 4/5. Very nice servers, but food took 20 minutes to come...

Beast,"WHAT TO TRY?!The beastwich!Full of flavor and chicken is crispy, this enough to fill your appetite if you're extra hungry. Gravy is extra thick with sausage bits inside as well! Can't complain the nice addition of a fried egg in the middle as well. We also had the pig ears (talk about being daring!) and it's crispy too. But I thought this was no special dish because the ears were a bit overfried and you'll hv to hv an appetite for pig hair because often times you'll see the hair on the fried ears. I don't think much plucking is done to get rid of the hair before they fry the ears. We ordered the French toast with duck confit garnished on top. The French toast on its own tasted alright but it's the combo with the sweet and salty which makes this dish interesting. You don't find this kind of combination at a lot of brunch places so it's worth the try!LAST TIP?!It's usually super packed here so beware of the wait times!! Perhaps try holding your spot the day of and specify the time you're coming in fifteen minutes before so they can mark your name down before you arrive. They can't seat more than 8 ppl per party in the restaurant so be wary of that. They also can't seat you if your full party has not arrived!

Beast is located on a street that I will never know how to pronounce, the closest intersection is King St and Tecumseth. It is a very small restaurant, with a very very small kitchen. I sat down with a friend aka my soulmate and foodie partner Bubbles (my favorite person to eat with) and we already knew what we wanted. We ordered the Fried Gnocchi Poutine, The Beastwich: fried chicken thigh, pimento cheese, pork sausage gravy and dessert which was some sort of Toffee Bread Pudding. We told the server that we were hungry but she still suggested just one sandwich to split. If you eat like myself and my friend, please do yourself a favor and order one each. The Fried Gnocci Poutine was interesting, I liked the Fried Gnocci aspect, but I didn't like the sauce. That evening it was a curry based sauce (not a fan of curry). It also wasn't what we expected, Poutine is supposed to be cheesy and covered in hot gravy. I gotta give the chef some points for creativity. Next up, our Beastwich arrived. It was very small. Looking back now, the Chef should use a larger biscuit. We cut the sandwich in half but couldn't pick it up. The biscuit was falling apart. The fried chicken is MASSIVE, very  very crispy. I wish it had more flavor though. Finally dessert! It was SO sweet, and we asked the waitress who explained how it was made with butter and caramel. It was like eating a bowl of melted werthers. Was way too sweet for our liking. The service was great and I would come back for maybe brunch.Keep Eating, Angela",4.0,3.0,333,2018-01-18,43.644115,-79.405753,"Canadian (New) , Breakfast & Brunch"

Beast,"Short story: if you want to eat here for breakfast, get here early / when it opens. You might still have to wait a while for your grub, but it's worth it. Order a donut to tide yourself over. You can't order booze until 11:00 a.m. You cannot go wrong with the plain beastwich, it's a masterpiece. Choose salad, not potatoes. Long story: We made a plan the night before to get here on time for brunch. We arrived at 10:15 and got the last table on the patio. We're lunchers, not brunchers, so this was a novelty. I decided to celebrate with a brunch drink -- there's a section on the menu called this. When I ordered, I found out you're not allowed to serve/order booze in Toronto before 11:00. Really?! As hopes for breakfast bevvies were dashed all over the patio, the server tried to distract us with the house-made donuts. We shared the one everyone was raving about, the maple bacon. It was covered with real bacon shavings. Odd, and yummy, great texture.People started squirming on the patio because service was super slow, as in no food was coming out. A bunch of plates were delivered to the patio en masse, an hour after we arrived, including our Beastwiches. We both got the signature one, with sausage gravy, fried egg and pimento cheese.

It consisted of fried chicken thigh, pimento cheese, pork sausage gravy and a fried egg. So good and so filling! I'm not a sandwich girl but goddamn it was fantastic! The sandwiches come with a choice of salad and potatoes and I got half and half. The salad tastes strongly of ginger so if you don't like ginger just order the potatoes. My boyfriend ordered the mad maple sandwich (fried chicken thigh, beast bacon, ontario maple syrup, and fried egg). It was similar to the beastwich but sweeter. It was not too sweet at all though. I was worried it would be really sweet when I took a bite but it was pure awesomeness. However my boyfriend did say that each bite was not consistent and some bites had more maple than others.",4.0,5.0,333,2017-07-09,43.644115,-79.405753,"Canadian (New) , Breakfast & Brunch"
Beast,Came here for brunch on the weekend. Line up was supppppppper long. You have to put your name down then wait outside in the cold until they call your name! If you're not there when they call you then the table is given away! Good thing it's close to the Main Street so you can walk around and get a coffee while waiting. Ambiance: small and cozy! Food: Great but nothing too memorable. They have good twists. Overall: Cozy place I'd go once to check it out :),4.0,3.0,333,2017-11-11,43.644115,-79.405753,"Canadian (New) , Breakfast & Brunch"
Beast,Frikkin finally got to try this place after bookmarking it for so long! Also attempted to come last Monday but they were closed!!! (Hence my close on mondays and tuesday tip).I ordered the beastwich sandwich for lunch and it did not disappoint. It had the perfect amount of flavour in each bite and who can go wrong with deep fried anything?! My only qualm is that the spicy sauce they offer as a condiment was not spicy at all! They need to take lessons from the hot sauce offered at rasta pasta. Then it would take it straight to BEASTMODE.Great experience overall. Keep it up.

Beast,"We went on a Saturday afternoon for brunch during a time when the sky was off and on opening up to downpours. They had great reviews, so it makes sense that lots of other people wanted to experience the goodness that Beast had to offer. I was a bit taken aback when we arrived to see a waiting list on the door and a crowd huddled outside to shield themselves from the rain, but we put our name on the list and waited. An hour later......we were called for our seat. Once inside the food was amazing and the service was on point. They explained that they were short staff plus the crowd was a bit larger today and the rain was limiting the ability to use the tables outside so it was the perfect storm resulting in long wait times. We got the maple chicken and biscuits.  So good, I mean absolutely delicious. We also started out with mimosas and then I decided I wanted to taste a Caesar. It seemed very Canadian and I needed to understand the difference between that and a Bloody Mary. To no fault of Beast, I didn't like the Caesar, but hey, I don't really like bloody Mary's either, so I'm certain this is no fault of Beast.

I tried the Beastwich and the Bruce Leroy, both sandwiches were delicious but I think the Beastwich was just a bit better. The only problem with the Bruce Leroy was the kimchi, it was a bit saltier and more soy based than usual kimchi. For appetizers, I sampled the pork hocks, fried mussels and chicken park poutine. All three were as amazing as I expected.

Beast,"Beast has been on my list of restaurants for awhile, after seeing it featured on You Gotta Eat Here! It took some time convincing friends to check this place out. It's an unassuming restaurant tucked away in a side street, just off King & Bathurst, with a pretty sweet happy hour. $5 drinks and buck-a-shuck oysters? Yes, please!The menu changes regularly, but the shining star is the Beastwich ($11). I've had my fair share of fried chicken and biscuits and gravy, but this combination was one of the best! We didn't get it with the fried egg, but it was already rich with the pool sausage gravy. The fried chicken was nice and crispy and the biscuits were moist. The beef heart tartare ($7) and albacure tuna ceviche ($5) were great value at that price. And we all really liked the grilled squid ($12), which we hope becomes a staple on the menu.Looking forward to my next visit, and can't wait to see what other dishes they come up with on future menus!",4.0,4.0,333,2017-03-30,43.644115,-79.405753,"Canadian (New) , Breakfast & Brunch"

I only wish they would start taking numbers so that you could roam around while you wait and they'll text you once your table is ready. Apart from the standard French toast, and breakfast plates, they have their fried chicken sandwiches. My friend got the Beastwich and I got the Bruce Leroy. I actually preferred the Bruce Leroy over the Beastwich because the sweet soy sauce was a nice contrast to the biscuit and fried chicken. Their duck confit French toast also looks fantastic. Also, you really can't leave without getting a donut. They have daily specials, so the flavours are always changing. The donuts are super doughy and a little chewy.

The bar selection is extensive.  The menu has lots to choose from & the food was very good! We had the Fish Pakora appetizer to start, delicious. Then I had the Paneer Tikka Masala & asked that it be prepared mild, because I'm a wimp.  It came out too spicy for me, but was better after adding a side of raita to cool it down. My husband got the Dilliwala Butter Chicken. He prefers very spicy & this was only medium to his palate.  So spice/heat levels can vary. Service was stellar until a large party came in, then there was a bit of scrambling to catch up.

Aanch Modernist Indian Cuisine,"I was in the mood for something different from my normal lunch fare and was excited to see that a new Indian restaurant opened up in the entertainment district. The interior is very modern and is definitely the type of atmosphere where you can have a business lunch. There were definitely a few of those around me when I was there.The lunch menu seems to focus on thali, which allows you to sample a variety of options for a single price. Apparently, there is a separate Monday/Wednesday/Friday menu and a Tuesday/Thursday menu. I ordered the chicken thali with chicken curry. I asked for the khalfi (ice cream), but I don't think the waiter heard me and I was given the kheer (rice pudding).The thali came with an appetizer of a samosa and Tandoori chicken. I really enjoyed the samosa and the Tandoori chicken was really well cooked and perfectly spicy. For carbs, there was basmati rice, a papadum, and a naan. The papadum was thin and crispy and the naan was soft. I wasn't expecting to get both, so it was a pleasant surprise. Next to the carbs was the chana pindi, which is a chickpea dish. The chickpeas were perfectly soft and tender. I don't recall the vegetable dish, but it was delicious and quite spicy. I used the yogurt raita to reduce the heat. The chicken curry was excellent. At first, I thought it was too sweet, but over time it became less sweeter and much more spicier. The chicken was not dry. Finally, I tried the dessert and I'm glad that it was delivered instead of the ice cream. It tasted like rice in a sweet milk sauce and was enjoyable to eat. During lunch service, the chef came out and asked everyone about the food. He was very gracious.I am not a connoisseur of Indian food at all.

Aanch Modernist Indian Cuisine,"Partner and I love Indian food and used to come here all the time when it was still called 259 Host. We were pretty devastated when 259 Host shut down earlier this year. So when Aanch opened we knew we had to pay a visit. Food- 4/5. Pretty extensive menu, but vegans/dairy-intolerant people beware... almost every single dish and sauce has dairy! I ordered from the vegetarian menu, but had to ask the chef to omit dairy from the Mushroom Medley. The only 2 vegan mains are the cauliflower and the okra dishes. Vegan carbs is rice since all the naan breads are made with dairy. My vegetarian partner really enjoyed his dishes though! The rosemary naan was especially well liked. Our only criticisms about the food are that the mains were a tad too spicy and too oily. Overall the dishes are very similar in taste, quality, and selection to 259 Host.

Aanch Modernist Indian Cuisine,"Mix up with Paypal voucher and Foodora but not the restaurant's fault delayed delivery. Once sorted out delivery was prompt and food hot.Chicken Xacuti ( relatively rare Goan dish) was 5 star. You could taste the dark roasted spices and ginger and it was tangy, just the way ti was supposed to be. Vindaloo was excellent too and the ingredients in both were top quality. The Baingan Bharta was mediocre but you could get a faint charcoal flavour so bonus points for that. The Chicken biryani was where things came apart. The chicken was plentiful and flavourful and of top quality. The spicing however was off with a cominance of some strange flavour (nutmeg?) overpowering everything else. Also too many pieces of strange green leaf mixed in (fresh coriander?) through it and I am not a great coriander fan. The rice arrived not quite cooked and with residual liquid in the bottom which told me it had been hurried and not allowed to cook properly.As I said the place uses top quality ingredients but it comes at a price. These 4 items cost almost $90 after delivery, taxes and tips and while the quantity gave me dinners for the next 4 days I would not have paid this if it hadnt been for an unusally generous promo from Paypal I would not have ordered from here.",4.0,4.0,11,2018-01-28,43.644708,-79.39067,Indian

Service is very friendly but not very efficient (little slow going around in circles)Food is good.  Tonkatsu is crisp outside and tender and juicy inside.  Free rice, miso soup and cabbage refills. Miso soup could be better. Cabbage dressing not so good. Tonkatsu sauce is good (they provide sesame seeds.  Don't forget to grind them to release the oils. Test by smelling before and after grinding)Tip: put some of the left over sesame seed on the rice to enhance the flavours Price is ok for most of the menu but the chicken karaage is overpriced. Overall a good place to fix your tonkatsu cravings.",4.0,4.0,150,2017-05-23,43.665424,-79.410779,Japanese
Mr.Tonkatsu,"Very good! Very welcoming servers who will patiently explain the menu as well as how you prepare your dipping sauce.I had the pork loin katsu, which was deliciously filled with cheesy goodness. It was very well executed because it was light and crispy and drained well - not oily for a fried pork chop. The sides were also just right. The price was reasonable and I was also told that the salad, rice, and miso soup could be refilled! I would return to try the chicken next time.",4.0,4.0,150,2017-06-16,43.665424,-79.410779,Japanese
Mr.Tonkatsu,"Mr Tonkatsu  These guys have two locations. One on Bloor and the other Yonge st. This is our go to place when we don't know what to have. They had long line ups when they first opened, but now it's a steady flow.  Location: Near the corner of Bathurst and Bloor. Just a stone throw away from the Bathurst subway station. Only a few on street parking spots. That's all because they turned Bloor st into a bike friendly street. There is a green P parking near by. During the week, I believe it's $8 from 6 PM to 7AM. 4/5 stars Atmosphere: Small place. Not much seating, be prepared to sit with people you don't know. They play very loud music, therefore hard to have a conversation. The decor look very rustic. Seats are hard, non cushion seats. That's probably how they make people leave. 4/5 stars Service: For such a small place, they service was poor. Called the server to place our order, but she said hold on a second because she wanted to place the order of the table that was seated 2 seconds before us. Well if they were ready, they would have called her. Took a few reminders about getting us water. The appetizer came 10 mins after we got our entrees. 2/5 stars Food: Fair warning to all, they mainly served deep fried food. I had pork loin with cheese. It comes with rice, miso soup, and cabbage. This is also refillable, so if you're like me and enjoys rice, bring it! The katsu sauce is tasty, but when you add crushed the sesame seeds given to you, it brings the sauce to another level. The chicken tights are also yummy. I also enjoy the pork loin with cheese in curry. This is Japanese curry, so it's not spicy. The breading is made in house, and is what makes or breaks a good katsu. 5/5 stars Price: When we this place first opened, the food was reasonably priced. But it seams like they recently raised their prices. The combos is plenty for a single person. The cost for 2 combos with 1 appetizer and 2 drinks costs us about $45 4/5 stars Overall: Since they have been open, the recipes have not changed. The consistency still the same. Great food, but if their prices go any higher, it won't be worth the price. 4/5 starsFollow me for more pictures on:Instagram: 905japesTwitter: 905Japes",4.0,4.0,150,2017-08-09,43.665424,-79.410779,Japanese
Mr.Tonkatsu,"My experience here can be summed up in one sentence. ""They ran out of rice"". How is that even possible? We basically waited for 40 minutes for our food because they had to cook the rice. Some people literally left cause they wait for too long. The food was honestly not bad and it's not too pricey but how do you run out of rice during a Sunday afternoon? Running out of rice at a Japanese restaurant is like running of out dough at a pizza place. I will go back but just please have rice ready, I don't want to wait another 40 mins.

James Cheese Back Ribs,"If you're looking for a good spot to eat, catch-up, and capture Instagram-able (Instagrammable?) moments, this is the spot for you. The signature dish is their namesake, BBQ back cheese ribs. What are they? Baby back ribs smothered in a tangy bbq sauce (spicy optional), wrapped in stringy mozzarella cheese, tableside. At first, it's a bit mesmerizing watching your server approach the table with tongs and scissors to stretch cheese. But the fun of watching cheese pulls is pleasantly followed with bites of tender ribs and chewy cheese. A unique but delicious combo. They also have a newer chicken and cheese platter which features dark meat chicken in a saucier sauce... Not as obnoxious as wrapping ribs in cheese, but the chicken is juicer and less messy to eat.Also on the menu, appetizers like pork belly, wings, baos, etc. and bowls of udon or kimchi fried rice. Plenty of choices for anyone part of your group. James Cheese is easier for walk-ins on weeknights but often crowded on weekends (reservations are wise) so plan accordingly. Overall, it's certainly a good option when your dining with a group, are in the Chinatown area, and are looking for a dinner and a show.",3.0,4.0,45,2017-12-17,43.65687,-79.39924,"Japanese , Korean , Asian Fusion"
James Cheese Back Ribs,"The food here is just all right and mediocre, but the service is very friendly and welcoming!!   The servers were very attentive to our needs, and accommodated my ask for both hot water and lemon. One even came over after, asking if I'd like a mix of hot and cold so that the water would be easier to drink at a warmer temperature! When I arrived, the waitress noted that I was carrying a cupcake and offered to refrigerate it for me. When I asked for it after, another server suggested bringing out two spoons for us!We got the cheesy rib platter, which came with two half racks. We got one to be mild, and the other lightly spicy. I preferred the mild flavour, though the spicy rack ended up leaner and therefore tastier. They give you a plastic glove to eat the ribs with, to avoid dirtying your hand. That said, I still ended up using my other hand to assist me to properly tear into the ribs haha!Since we came on a Friday, we were given complimentary fries with our order of the cheese platter. The fries were quite heavily battered, and, as my friend said, tasted like Costco fries! The platter had a mashed potato side (slightly too dry), buttered corn kernels (very dry and chewy), four small sausages (two tasted cheesier and were very bouncy to the touch), sweet potato mash (heavenly), and egg. Overall, my comment would be that the platter ended up too hard and dry. They turned the heat off, and the cheese and all the sides began hardening. In fact, the cheese formed such a crust that it was impossible to scrape off in the end. Still an experience, and again, the service is impeccable!",3.0,3.0,45,2018-01-20,43.65687,-79.39924,"Japanese , Korean , Asian Fusion"

You should try to eat it when it's nice and hot to get the best taste and experience.The service is great at this restaurant, the ribs are good, but the rest of the items are average.

James Cheese Back Ribs,"Great tasting ribs and awesome table service.Environment:Located near the Spadina/College intersection, the restaurant is located at a vibrant neighbourhood with many shops, and it is easily accessible by public transit.The store is quite small however, with only enough tables to sit roughly 10 parties. But they can accomodate large groups for the big tables at the back.Food: They have daily specials available and when I went on a Friday the daily special was one order of free fries, which were normally $2 each. The fries looked and tasted like McDonald fries, which I kinda liked and it was so addicting.For main, my friend and I shared the cheese ribs between the two of us. We ordered the medium spicy and it was actually too much for me. My eyes were tearing, my nose was runny, and my was aching...it wasn't a peasant sight. So I would suggest that if you're really not good at handling spiciness you should totally get the non-spicy option, because the ribs were actually really good otherwise. On the hot plate there were mozzerella cheese which was used to wrap the ribs, some steamed eggs, butter corn, mash popatoes, mashed yam, and a few weiner sausages. The rest of the sides were quite tasty as well, but the best part of the dish was definitely the ribs!Service:One thing that makes this place stands out is its personalized table service. The servers would come to your table to cook the ribs for you and help you wrap the cheese. They only work on a few pieces at a time so you can enjoy the ribs while the cheese was still soft and warm. The servers would come back to make a few more once they realized that your current batch was finished.The servers were super attentive and totally deserved the added tipsOverall, the meal was fantastic. Food was tasty and one order of the cheese ribs was enough for 2 people, which cost roughly $15 per person. The servers were skilled at preparing the cheese ribs and were attentive to our requests. I would totally come back again and try their non-spicy ribs",3.0,5.0,45,2017-10-27,43.65687,-79.39924,"Japanese , Korean , Asian Fusion"

James Cheese Back Ribs,"I knew that James Cheese Back Ribs just opened up a few weeks ago.  When I first saw their cheesy ribs pictures, it made me mouthwatering.  Aww~ I wanted to eat those cheese on ribs!  I wasn't sure at first if it was good as I expected because I found some negative comments.  However, I went for it.  Different people have different tastes right!?  FOOD (3.5 stars)I went there with a friend from Yelp too. She loves food, same like me  (right Kerry!?) ^^.  We ordered the Spicy James Cheese Back Rib ($34.5) for sharing.  They have three different levels of spiciness, mild, spicy and Super spicy.  If you think an order of the JC Back Ribs won't be enough for you and your friends but two orders is too much for you guys, you can add on a half order for $17 or add extra ribs for $12.5.  Or you can get extra cheese for $2.5 or extra sauce for $1.5.  Check your menu or ask your servers. They are super nice! We got a regular JC Back Ribs and two pints of Sapporo.  Who could forget a beer with ribs? Cheers!Price (3.5 stars)  $$Service (4.5 stars) All the staff that evening were very friendly and attentive.  I got seated fast and waited for my friend arrived.  The first server came to take out our order after my friend came. They set up the table in few minutes.  We didn't wait too long for the food came out.  Then, they explained about food and showed us how to eat their ribs. ""Red"", was the waiter who came in and showed us how to wrap the cheese around the ribs.  It took a few minutes to do so.  He wrapped them all for us. He came few times to do it.  We weren't lazy to do it by ourselves but we were having a deep conversation lol.  We spent time there quite long, 4 hours approximately lol (from 7 pm till it was closed).  We were chatting till forget the time.  The staff came to check on us many times without any attitude.  Thank you ;) AMBIANCE (3.5 stars)The restaurant looked modern and clean.  However, I felt like the tables were a bit small if you were a big eater lol. You need to ask for a big table if you know you will order a lot. I'm sure they will accommodate the best for their customers who love eating so much lol.OVERALL (3.5 stars)Ribs were good. Service was excellent. And yes, I would come back again with my husband and friends lol.  I wanna try other things like pork belly, kimchi fried rice, especially the ""Korean MCRib."" Awww~ Oh!

James Cheese Back Ribs,"This review and rating is purely for my Uber Eats food experience and I didn't order their ribs. The ribs seems more worth to eat in person and with company. With such good reviews, I thought that their other food items would reflect the taste quality of their best seller. I was sadly mistaken.I ordered the braised beef soup udon and fried chicken wings. Blandest soup noodles I've ever had in my life. There was no flavour at all - I would have been at least satisfied if it was salty enough. You would think with all the ingredients in there it would have some taste. The chicken wings are the saving grace of the meal but not by much, the portion is a little smaller than I expected and it was pretty average tasting.To be honest, I wouldn't bother leaving a review if the food tasted mediocre - I would just make a mental note not to order again. But I'm leaving this review because I do hope that the restaurant will not neglect the quality of the rest of their menu even though I'm sure the ribs are excellent. I do hope to visit the actual restaurant and will be open to changing my review. For now though, I would advise against ordering those two food items for delivery.",3.0,2.0,45,2017-11-03,43.65687,-79.39924,"Japanese , Korean , Asian Fusion"
James Cheese Back Ribs,"FYI: This isn't like a super helpful tip but they give you these tiny hard candies with your check that I found were adorable lol.Yes...I saw this place on a video on Facebook, and yes the necessity of me going here was urgent. Like life or death people.WHAT I GOT: Cheese ribsPROS: Repeat after me. You can NEVER go wrong with meat and cheese. EVER. And my goodness, James Cheese Back Ribs is winning the restaurant game. You get a pool of gooey cheese that the server wraps around each rib along with extra corn, two different mashes (sweet potato and regular potato), mini sausages, and scrambled eggs. The ribs themselves were coated in this beautiful and super flavorful sauce, and the meat was super tender as well. Literally fell off the bone with one bite. They also give you scissors and some plastic gloves to keep your hands clean, along with the option to choose the heat level of your ribs. We went with mild, which honestly is not spicy at all, so if you're looking for even a little bit of a kick, I would suggest the regular spicy option.CONS: Ok well the price is pretty hefty. Not gonna lie. And the sides aren't exactly the most tasty things ever but combined with the cheese, usually anything will taste good. But be warned, the server will turn off the gas stove that melts the cheese once all the ribs are wrapped so the cheese will start to get hard again. If you wanna dip your sides, eat those first. And the ribs are a bit on the small side so this meal won't actually fill you up, if that's what you're looking for.",3.0,4.0,45,2017-10-01,43.65687,-79.39924,"Japanese , Korean , Asian Fusion"
James Cheese Back Ribs,"Note: this review is not about the cheese ribs. I bet the ribs are really good and maybe I should've got them, but this review is based on their lunch special I had I went there around 12 on a Monday for a bowl of gyudon. Having been to a lot of Japanese restaurants, I expected gyudon to be a rice bowl topped with soft beef, onions, and pickled ginger. Instead, I got 5 slices of beef shank that were very hard to chew--they tasted practically like beef jerky. The beef to rice ratio was very poor: very little beef and a whole bowl of rice. The miso soup was the saltiest thing I've ever had. I've had Japanese miso soup and I've had Korean miso soup (black bean soup), but what I had here was legitimately the saltiest thing I've ever had. I couldn't drink it after two spoons. Maybe I should've come for the ribs, but I expected this place to have lunch specials too.

James Cheese Back Ribs,"""Ribs make everyone happy"" Cute mottoWe didn't have a reservation but got a seat within 10 minutes for two people. We ordered: Full rack of ribs (mild)Pork bellySake Mojito cocktail Tokyo rose cocktailCocktails that are $8 are $6 on SatsServers were friendly. Place was clean and brightly lit. Washrooms were clean!The verdict:The ribs are nicely seasoned and tender. I didn't find the cheese added much taste because it didn't have any taste. It gave it a cheesy texture, but it wasn't anything special. Kind of reminded me of cheese fondue. In my opinion, this is a novelty, but not worth $35.Mashed potatoes, sausage (put cheese on this), and corn were really good. Flavourful.I found the sweet potatoes too soggy. Egg was overcookedTIP: they give you a glove to wear when eating the ribs, put it on your non-dominant hand so you have the other to use the spoon and chopsticks with. Pork belly: It wasn't as soft as I would have liked it but nicely seasoned. The presentation was nice too.Sake mojito: I like this! It was light but goodTokyo rose: orange juice with sake or Soju -  it wasn't the bestFor a total of $70 including tax and tip, I didn't think it was worth it since my husband wasn't full.

James Cheese Back Ribs,"3.5 starsRecently came here after seeing so many pictures of this infamous cheesy ribs. It's what everyone orders pretty much when they're here. The ribs came on a heated pan filled with cheese of course, mash potato, mash sweet potato, egg, corn and some veggies. Be aware if you're a big eater the ribs might not be enough for a big group. However, if you're just with another person then a half rack I think would be enough. To be honest, the ribs tasted good but nothing special. I think it's partly because we chose mild so there's literally no spice. I wish we chose a medium spicy so at least there's some kick to it. Also be careful of the cheese..they turn cold fast so you better eat the ribs quick before it turns into a blob.Service is great with the servers always refilling your cup and helping you twirl cheese on your ribs.",3.0,3.0,45,2017-09-10,43.65687,-79.39924,"Japanese , Korean , Asian Fusion"

I mean they're good but not extraordinary! It would have been nice to have a little more cheese as well.The sides were okay but got cold pretty fast (corn, sweet and regular mash) after the stove is turned off (to prevent cheese from over cooking) and the egg was a little disappointing.

James Cheese Back Ribs,"I really love the idea of this restaurant (meat and cheese... my two favorites together) but it was a pretty average dinner meal. On a Friday night this place was packed, and we put our names down to wait for a seat. I just walked around Chinatown for an hour before they called us to come inside. Of course we order the cheese ribs, and the food takes some time before it arrives. It's a really big and pretty pot of cheese, half rack of ribs, some corn, egg, and vegetables. The service was super nice and the servers helped us with wrapping the cheese and taught us how to do it ourselves. They turn off the heat after the cheese is completely melted, but then after a few minutes the cheese hardened up again and it basically tasted like lukewarm pizza cheese around the ribs. I'm kind of a carnivore as well and I think the portion was kind of on the smaller side for two people to share, so definitely order more ribs if you come with 2+ people. I don't think it's worth the hour-long wait, but it wasn't a bad experience either.",3.0,3.0,45,2017-10-26,43.65687,-79.39924,"Japanese , Korean , Asian Fusion"

Two loves! Their servers were nice and attentive! Ambiance is super chill and I loved their decor. :) The restaurant was quite spacious and very nice.

We thought we would be getting an additional grill with more toppings but we ended up just getting a few extra ribs.

Who doesn't love the base of bacon?! Fat pairs with more fat to create a crazy bastard supernova of fatty goodness.

Leslie Jones,"The super salad isn't that super. We were staying close by and thought the menu looked good. I was pretty hungry and got the super salad, which comes in two sizes. I got the bigger of the two for $21. It was smaller than some appetizer salads I've had. The chicken was cut into tiny cubs and I imagine if I put them all together it would probably be 2oz of chicken. I was still hungry. The ambiance and service were great.

Leslie Jones,"I have to admit, I was sold on the backyard patio. I came into Leslie Jones with high hopes based off of the reviews I've read on Yelp. When I called to make reservations for a Friday night (on a Friday night!) I was pleasantly surprised that i was able to get a spot on the patio during the time prime of 7:30. Unfortunately though, i have come to these conclusions after my underwhelming dining experience:1. The food portions were quite small for the price you pay for.2. The service was extremely slow. It took a long time for food to come out, and the servers were consistently swamped the whole evening, even when the restaurant wasn't full. 3. Overall, the food was tasty, but for a $60 bill, neither my partner nor I walked out feeling full. Oh well.

Leslie Jones,"Leslie Jones is a fun place for food and friends.  It is located on Queen between Leslie and Jones, hence the name. Here are a few highlights...1. Leslie Jones has a nice variety of pasta dishes, beef, seafood, and pizzas. I opted for the chicken pizza, which was the slightest bit too salty, but otherwise great. At 15$, it was priced in line with others around town.2. The service here is very good, especially by Toronto standards. The chef and the server both had a real warmth and welcoming attitude that was refreshing.3. They have a great selection of wines and spirits here.4. The dessert here could give anyone else's dessert a run for its money. The chocolate flour less torte and the cheesecake were both smash hits at my table.5. The space is small, clean, and inviting.

Leslie Jones,"We gave a 3 because of two things 1. The ridiculous 18% gratuity added for parties of 6 or more.  Patrons should NEVER be forced to pay anything, especially this much!!!!  And we were only 6 people!!  2.  We sat at the back near the patio door and it was open...and we had to keep closing it.  It's not summer and it was cold which made the first half of the night unbearable.  I think they finally got the hint and kept it closed.  The food was very good and fresh.  My SMALL AND TEENY Cosmo was $14.00!!!!  So, even though this place is cute and quaint and the service was nice, this party of 6 won't be returning for reasons stated above.",4.0,2.0,57,2016-04-16,43.66289,-79.331837,"Comfort Food , Mediterranean , Italian"

Leslie Jones,"I wanted to love this place.  We moved not too long ago to Leslieville, and Leslie Jones is one of the places that we set aside for a special night.  Tonight was one of those.  The service is awesome, and the menu looked great.  But in the company of great Leslieville restaurants like Lil Baci, and Queen Margherita, which have similarly priced menus that include pizza, comparisons are bound to be drawn.  The wine was expensive at $12 for what seemed like a 4 ounce glass.  The Beet salad was pretty good.  But the pizza was not to the level that we've come to expect in Toronto, especially not at $16 for a small 4 slice pie.  The sausage was chunky and comparable to what one might expect at a lower priced grab and go chain.  The unannounced Parmesan cheese, below the layer of mozzarella was an unwelcome surprise.  But above all, I took issue with the crust which was heavy and brittle for what was supposed to be a thin crust.I have a feeling the other menu items, especially the dessert might be worth trying, but unfortunately due to this pizza experience I probably won't be back to write about it. Such a shame, I was hoping to have a 4 star experience and truly ended up with about 2.5.",4.0,3.0,57,2014-06-26,43.66289,-79.331837,"Comfort Food , Mediterranean , Italian"

Aft Kitchen & Bar,"Despite living nearby, I've only visited Aft twice - once for dinner and once for brunch.  This review will focus on brunch, as the dinner happened a long time ago, so my memories are a bit fuzzy and I don't remember specifics.I actually didn't realize Aft even had breakfast options until, in an effort to feed my increasingly hangry husband, I turned to Yelp for nearby brunch options.  We have a couple old faithfuls in the Queen/Broadview neighbourhood, but we wanted something new.  Aft to the rescue.For a small restaurant, Aft has a healthy brunch menu, consisting mostly of savoury meat-based dishes with an obligatory sugary option for those of us who are relentlessly tormented by their sweet tooth.  But really, what do you expect for a place that specializes in smoked meats and other barbecue flavours?  Vegans, turn away; there is nothing here for you.As I said, my sweet tooth always prevails, so I ordered the french toast.  My husband stuck to the Broadview Breakfast, which consists of your standard breakfast fare - eggs, meat (your choice of sausage, bacon, or Canadian bacon), toast, home fries, and baked beans.The portions are really hearty.  Despite looking a bit underwhelming, my french toast was too much to finish.  Battered in corn flakes and fried, I really enjoyed the crunchy texture alongside the doughy challah, and the light dusting of cinnamon sugar was subtle without being imposing.  As a surprise, it came topped with two slices of double-smoked bacon, which was more than enough to balance out the sweetness.After tax and tip, I think we spent about $45 for our meal, which is pretty standard for two meals (no alcohol) in the area.  The only reason this isn't 5-stars?  My receipt pointed out that I paid paying $5 for ""Freshly Squeezed Orange Juice.""  I didn't realize that pouring directly from a bottle of Tropicana (I watched this happen) was considered ""freshly squeezed.""  I mean, I ordered the juice, I have no problems paying for it, but just don't tell me I've paid for something far superior to what I got.  The menu didn't really list any juices or coffees, so I just ordered what I saw other patrons drinking.  Honestly, I think my disappointment could have been avoided if I had just spent a few more bucks and getting something liquor based.  My husband spent $5.50 on coffee, but at least he got a whole Bodum worth.Long story short - great food, limited coffee/juice options, avoid the orange juice, try a cocktail instead for a few bucks more (it is primarily a bar after all).",4.0,4.0,142,2016-10-03,43.658809,-79.350781,"Bars , American (Traditional)"

The Four Seven,"Ok, so I get that the food and beer are tasty and I love the idea of sharing plates. However, the price of these small plates is a bit outrageous for what you actually get.

We are also small people. I just think that spending over $40 a person on food would result in feeling full. Not to mention that the beer is severely over priced. A bottle of craft beer for $16-$24 is beyond ridiculous. Looking up some of the beers on the LCBO website and seeing them go for $3.50 was disheartening. I ordered a couple glasses of red wine (which was actually really good) but when I ordered my 2nd glass the waiter brought the bottle to the table and free poured it...even though I hadn't finished drinking my first glass. At first I thought ""oh good, if he's free pouring on top of my unfinished wine, he might pour a little extra"". Nope. I'm pretty sure I was poured up to the amount that my first glass was at...with the added extra wine that I hadn't finished, so ultimately a pretty tiny pour. After being there for an hour and a half and having 3 glasses of wine, I was obviously quite thirsty and asked for a glass of water to which the waiter responded with ""Water?!"" as if to say ""Why aren't you ordering more wine?"". I wasn't very impressed with that. Dude, I need water. Don't try to make me feel stupid for being human.I do have to say that all the food tasted very good. Good job to the kitchen.

I knock off a star because there are patrons who frequent there that may have some personalities that won't play well with others. There was a grumpy dude at the bar reading a novel who got all riled up because I stood directly behind him to discuss the menu with my drinking partner. He was all miffed and whipped off his glasses like ""wtf man, I'm reading"". First of all, why would you read at a dimly lit bar, and secondly, it's a bar, so there will be conversation and noise, so you don't get to be upset over that. Read somewhere else, buddy. Boo hoo.

The cocktails were all custom and well explained by Dimitri, and really tailored the drinking experience to the individual. Finally the music, back to back amazingness.

But a girl can dream. Now to the good, no great, stuff - the food is spectacular. We got pretty much everything off the menu, except regretfully, the bottomless mimosa. The best thing on the menu was definitely the French toast and maple pork belly, both of which can also be ordered as a side, so yay! The lemon zest on the avocado toast is divine.

We double-checked the hours online and at the door, and they all said that they opened at 11am. We waived at the guy inside, but he ignored us. Few minutes later more people showed up, and I guess the dude inside knew them, because he came over to the door, and opened it to tell them that they are under new management and the chef did not show up to work.

Lots of tacos and tostadas. Not a bad thing. We had the tofu tostadas. Tangy lime and cilantro created it a tasty snack. The tofu was tender and well marinated. We both enjoyed it. The service was friendly and attentive. Here's the crux. We ordered a ""Caesar salad"" and got five pieces of romaine with a few globs of bland dressing and a couple cherry tomatoes.

Bar Isabel,"Amazing meal and absolutely delicious tapas! I came with a group of colleagues for a company dinner and ordered the tasting menu.  Everything was so good... My only regret is not knowing what was on the menu so that I wasn't able to pace myself accurately for eating! By the time I was finished, I was able to roll myself home.We started off with grilled shishito peppers, olives, and marcona almonds. The peppers were soft but so flavourful. Next came a variety of cured meats and protein. There was the whitetail carpaccio with a dollop of blue cheese in the centre. There was also some jamon cured for four years, some chorizo, and some cheese (forgot the type). The jamon had a generous streak of fat, which really brought out the pork flavour. The chorizo, however, was heavenly. Absolutely excellent charcuterie! The dishes came with a side of bread, along with some very rich olive oil and salt for dipping. Everyone loved the bread, and we all had a bit too much...The whole fish ceviche came next. I believe it was a red snapper, and it was served with cucumbers marinated in a citrusy mayo-like sauce. I loved the tangy taste and stuffed myself with this dish. The fish was also perfectly fried - the collar was a beautiful crisp! Then came the sweetbreads and raw tuna. Having never eaten sweetbread before, I was surprised to learn that this is the veal thymus gland. It was breaded beautifully and fried, and was super juicy on the inside. The pickled vegetables added a pop of flavour and complemented the sweetbread perfectly. The raw tuna also provided a nice balance and soft cushion to the crisp sweetbread.By this time, I was getting full... But then! Then the foie gras was served. Chilled and grated foie gras was plated on top of sweet vegetables (forgot the type) and laid over the house made baguette. I am not kidding - the foie gras melted at the slightest touch! It was like eating a buttery, fluffy cloud. My lips were coated in natural glossy shine afterwards...Patatas bravas were served after, but I regret to say that I was so full by this time that I couldn't eat any. It smelled heavenly though. Stir fried garlic snow pea leaves mixed with mint and cilantro came soon, and I had so much of this! It was delightful, and reminded me slightly of the Chinese stir fried snow pea leaves. I was particularly fond of the salty parmesan cheese bits mixed in, as they really highlighted the flavour. There were also clams with house made tomato sauce, served with stir fried beans and salted cod. I loved the salted cod! It was fatty, but the tangy and sweet tomato sauce provided the perfect balance. I found that the flavour of the clams fell flat though.At this point, I was already stuffed. But... The whole octopus, one pound king crab legs, and ribeye were all served at once. I wasn't mad about the king crab legs; though meaty, the sauce was a little too much and overbearing. The steak was SO good. It was a little chewy and tough, but the flavour was on point. It was perfectly medium rare, and the crisp and sear on the outside was impeccable. The octopus, however, was my favourite hands down. I had a whole leg, and it was crispy with a slight grilled char. You could literally taste the fire charcoal taste from the octopus. Despite being so full, I just had to go for seconds.Finally, we finished with two desserts. Something similar to an apple crumble arrived - I believe it was poached pears with goat cheese. Not a fan of the salty cheese, but the fruit and crumble was delightful. There was also Basque cake with sherry cream... Though rich, it was creamy and warming.We had the sommelier choose the wine for us, and they chose the medium boded red, a Gonzalez-Byass, Finca Moncloa, 2012. It was velvety and smooth, and went down so easily. There was a distinct taste of oak and something richer, though I'm not quite an expert to place my finger on what it was.

Bar Isabel,"3.5 stars ... some good dishes but service was slipping very fast throughout the night & flavours weren't as great as other 4 star places.Maybe I came with too high of an expectation, maybe I ordered wrong (but I would have hoped the server steered us right), or maybe it's one of their off nights.  Maybe Bar Isabel isn't my place.  I came here incredibly hopeful of a mind blowing meal that rivalled my Buca or Grey Gardens experience as it's rated in the top 15 in Canada 100 best restaurant.  That's some serious cred right there but for the price, it was just ok for us.They do have online reservations but this small, dimly lit, and super loud bar books up super fast.  I made weekend reservations a month in advance.  That was easy and simple to do.  Our arrival was quickly greeted and shown to our table.  We were seated in the back along the wall.  It was comfortable and tables were well spaced.  Unfortunately it was so soooo loud.  You cannot have a conversation even when yelling.  We noticed most tables were either getting louder and louder with the more glasses poured or they're quickly leaving with little conversation.  Service here is quite varied ... looking at other tables, there were 2 very good staff who helped craft the dinners and mentioned the specials.  Ours just nodded their head and he never mentioned once the specials or what was good to order when asked.  This is where I feel we probably ordered wrong.We had the garden pickles, ensalada de la casa, scallops, bone marrow, chorizo rojo, and quarter octopus along side some ciders.  We didn't order the famed Basque cake because we waited and waited for someone to come by but we were mostly left ignored for nearly 15 minutes with menus on our tables. Garden Pickles - decent with fair variety of different vegetables but nothing unusual or special about it.  Comparing to maple leaf tavern, theirs had an unique spice kick that made it pop.  This was just simple.  3.5/5Ensalada de la casa - one of the better dishes of the night.  Several variety of different shaved vegetables lightly and nicely dressed.  It had Sprouts, fennel, carrots, Brussels sprouts, and pomegranate.  Light and refreshing.  Solid choice 4/5Bone Marrow - I've had bone marrow at a few other places and it's usually a rich wonderful bite with the accompaniments.  This was mostly a miss ... this is definitely one of the smaller marrows at a higher price point.  It came with 4 pieces of large toasted bread that were possibly cut too big as each bite consisted mostly of dried bread, a smear of lightly flavoured chimichurri, and a few tiny spoonful of marrow.  There wasn't enough marrow to even make it to 3 pieces of bread and the chimichurri was very light in flavour compared to the Argentinian ones I've had which help make the meat pop and cut through the juicy fatty flavour.  3/5Scallops - maybe Toronto has a hard time doing scallops.  Thinly sliced scallops are lightly grilled and then placed on an asparagus and leek sauce.  The scallops were cooked fairly good.  The sear marks were a faded beige and because of how it was thinly sliced, once of the pieces were already crumbling before even attempting to eat it.  The leek and asparagus sauce was mild and didn't really add much flavour to the already mild scallops.  It reminds me of my Good Son scallops order ... I wish I got something else 3/5Chorizo rojo - most flavourful dish of the night.  Bold and smokey, this is a great chorizo.  Loved the spicy heat that it brings.  It is a small portion but because of the flavour, it is satisfying.  If all dishes were this good, I would have left quite happy. 4/5Grilled quarter octopus - this is supposedly be one of the best octopus in Toronto if you read Yelp reviews.  A quarter octopus is a decent size to share for a smaller group or twosome.  It is nicely tender with a softer chew and some good grilled edges.  Cooking wise... awesome.  Flavour ... it was missing compared to other places I've had.  The sauce had some spice (paprika?) but it wasn't enough to give the octopus anything to be memorable.  3.5/5I was hoping for an amazing dinner but left quite disappointed.  Service ended up being forgetful and we left without dessert because it just took too long to be acknowledged.  Bar isabel clearly is loved but just didn't provide the flavour or service for me to recommend.",4.0,3.0,350,2017-07-09,43.654647,-79.420789,"Spanish , Tapas Bars"

Bar Isabel,"Oh, Bar Isabel, if only you weren't so darn noisy! I really like the ambiance here, it's dark and romantic. However, during my last visit, my experience was unfortunately punctured by a very loud group that sat across from us. The restaurant is always packed when I go so I would recommend reservations. Despite the large group I saw mostly couples so I would say it's more of a date location or an intimate tapas date with some close friends - I think I just had bad luck the last time! On my last visit, I came here with my 2 girlfriends and we ordered several things on the menu. The ones that really stood out to me were the bone marrow (#1!!!), the sweet breads, and the whole fish ceviche. The bone marrow was one of the best I've ever had, and it was so simple. You know it's quality bone marrow when it's not loaded with extra toppings and seasonings. The sweet breads had a rich taste and lovely soft texture. The presentation of the whole fish ceviche was something to be admired. The outside shell of the fish was fried so you could eat it! It was crunchy and not greasy. The ceviche had a lovely citrus taste and wasn't overly sour like some other ceviche's I've had. Other things we ordered included the house salad, which was just ordinary (we needed some greens so opted for that) and the patatas, again just ordinary, but a nice palette cleanser for the rich foods we got. The service was excellent. Our waitress answered all the questions we had and checked up on us at regular intervals.

Bar Isabel,"A small and cozy Spanish tapas bar and restaurant located on Ossington, this is a great place to feel sexy and cool.Dimly lit, this restaurant/bar serves up a small but interesting taps menu.  Definitely make reservations because it is always packed.  We came here at 6pm (when it opens) and managed to get a table.We ordered for the table: octopus, stuffed peppers, garlic snow pea shoots; carpaccio; some sort of potato cake type dish and one other dish with chorizo in it.The octopus can be ordered as quarter, half or full so depending on how many people want to try it you can choose accordingly.  It was delicious- tender and lightly flavored.  Eat it fast though bc when it sits for a bit the texture starts becoming rubbery.I didn't particularly care for the stuffed peppers- it lacked some flavour and were a bit boring.The dish with chorizo- as I don't eat pork the server was so lovely to bring the dish over with the chorizo on a separate plate - that was instead of being mixed into the dish I could eat the rest of the dish!  The service we had was lovely- our server asked us about food restrictions and made recommendations and suggestions when we had questions about the menu.  I'll definitely come back here - it's just a great night!",4.0,4.0,350,2017-01-22,43.654647,-79.420789,"Spanish , Tapas Bars"

Very good value, we managed to try quite a few dishes and they were all delicious.

Bar Isabel,"Coming in on a Wednesday night, I didn't expect this place to be as packed as it was. Fortunately by being alone, the staff was able to get me seated at a 2-top despite the numerous reservations in queue. Awesome!I came to this dark and lavish restaurant per a recommendation from a friend back home, and I'm so glad I traveled out here to try. The environment, super-professional staff, and exquisite cuisine really made my day in Toronto extra special.Started off with ""My Favorite Ex Girlfriend"" as my cocktail of choice. It was sweet and refreshing, with that alcohol-induced burn finish, reminiscent of your last breakup. At $16CAD I had apprehensions, but after trying it, I was quite satisfied.I ordered the 1/4 Octopus, but decided to start with the Jamon Croquetas per recommendation from my waiter. I had no idea what to expect. Out came two little crispy morsels about egg size. There was a rich creamy sauce, with onion, but I didn't taste much ham? Or maybe there was a bunch of ham in there? OK, I'll be honest, I practically swallowed them whole. It was delicious. Don't judge me.Finally came my Quarter Octopus. WOW. I kept staring at it. I didn't want to eat it because it LOOKED SO GOOD. And after 10 photos and 5 minutes of staring I finally gave in. The chorizo sausage tucked into the dish had that perfect natural smokiness with a meaty homemade texture, and not that chewy, store-bought casing you would have to masticate for a couple minutes. It was really spicy, just the way I love it! The octopus itself was grilled to perfection, and did not have a rubbery texture; just just meaty goodness from the sea. I was in meat heaven! The sauce in the dish had a lightly tart, spicy and herbal flavor but not powerful enough to interfere with the natural flavor from the octopus and sausage. It was absolutely delightful.I'm in love with Bar Isabel. I need to come back and eat.

Soba Canada,"I went to Ichiriki Restaurant to try the soba menu and ordered the Ten Zaru Soba which is a cold soba for dipping in a sauce and comes with tempura on the side. It was SO good! The noodles have a great texture and are all uniformly thin. The sauce was a bonito/soy type sauce and came with green onions and freshly grated real wasabi on the side. I added them together and with the soba, it tasted really good. The tempura included two shrimps and a variety of vegetables. The batter had a lot of finesse and was incredibly light, it also came with a lime wedge and some togarishi salt on the side. Really delicious. My friend ordered the chirashi soba which is also cold but comes with the sauce already. It also had nice pieces of real crab, ikura and tamago that was cut the same size as the soba. The flavours were excellent as well from the bite I tried. We also ordered the oboro tofu to share on the side. Silky smooth, lovely clean taste. I really enjoyed this as well although for people who don't like tofu in general, I don't think they would appreciate this since this dish allows the flavour of the tofu to shine and it's not covered with a lot of additional flavour even though it has a sauce like the soba sauce as well. Service was nice, atmosphere was quiet and cozy. One thing to note is that this place is CASH ONLY. Btw, if people are looking at the photo of the menu that is posted here, please note that that menu is super old and it will differ when you go to the restaurant.",4.0,5.0,11,2017-11-02,43.671283,-79.383888,"Japanese , Noodles"

Soba Canada,"I enjoyed the food at Soba Canada as it fit a lot of the criteria I look for when I'm going to a ""specialty"" restaurant: menu items not easily found elsewhere, authentic, fresh ingredients, homemade everything....but the one criteria it was missing for me, was value - or should I say, volume.  At an average of $20 for a soba dish, it's just a little bit steep to eat more than once in my life.  It's not that I wouldn't pay $20 for food, it's just that I had to go eat a real dinner after that.  Word of advice, if you're hungry, do not get the oboro soba (house-made tofu on soba) just for yourself without planning to share someone else's meal. It's literally a glob of tofu on top of plain noodles.  The seafood soba came with veggie and seafood tempura though which was very well done and just filling enough for a light-medium eater.A note on the ambiance at the restaurant; there is none.  There is no background music and it wasn't very crowded when I went, so it was dead silent and super awkward because if you spoke at barely above a whisper, the whole restaurant could hear you.  Also the furniture belongs in a library from the 90's, not a restaurant.Overall, I think I liked Soba Canada because the food was ""authentic"" and fresh.  But at the same time, you have to like buckwheat noodles to begin with, and cold noodles just don't provide that satisfaction of a filling meal, especially not for dinner.",4.0,3.0,11,2013-12-03,43.671283,-79.383888,"Japanese , Noodles"
Soba Canada,"I really enjoyed my experience of Fresh made Soba at Soba Canada.. Just the idea of having someone willing to offer this unique and authentic experience in Toronto! That alone worth an extra 1 star! Buckwheat flour suppose to be nutritious and rich in vitamins and dietary fibre. This do give me an excuse to indulge on my soba experience! Hey eating buckwheat suppose to lowers blood pressure, controls blood sugar and increase liver function (that's what I need being hyper, eating too much sugary marcarons and drinking too much alcoholic beverages!) Just love how everything that was served here are related to buckwheat.. from appetizer, main and dessert! I am lucky enough to able to tried all the different soba by sharing an Okonomi Soba with my dining mate... now I know which one I will pick if I am lucky to come here again! Oboro Tofu - love how soft and silky the tofu blended well with the soba taste... give me a light and refreshing taste and feel of well being and healthy... Tororo - I usually love yam... but not this form of puree Japanese yam.. I find that it makes the soba really gluey tasting and really blend and heavy Orishi - So so.. but if you are for the pure taste of raw radish, this one is for you Ikura Roe - I always have a weakness for Salmon roe and the freshly grated wasabi... that's the one I going to order for sure next time Snow Crab - enjoyed the crab meat..just because they are good tasting and I love crab... nicely presented.... Next up is the Sobayu, why are we served the water that the fresh soba was cooked in? As most of the water soluble nutrients and vitamins were lost in the hot water that soba was cooked in, so by drinking that boiled water, you will recap all the good things that soba provided. You suppose to mix the water with the soba dipping sauce. Taste wise is it nothing exciting but just the idea behind this is so interesting! So the verdict of fresh vs packaged soba, which one I prefer? The texture between them are different as the fresh one are more chewy and has a stronger buckwheat taste!

Soba Canada,"Traditional and Authenticity brought me to Soba Canada's website a few years ago.  The curiosity began as typically watching a television show of a Soba Chef cutting FINE lengths of fresh Soba with a Soba Kiri. (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So…)Having missed my opportunity in Tokyo to experience a Soba experience, I now look to Soba Canada which is held at Ichiriki on Tuesday nights.  We were sat in a quiet room with a couple other tables of patrons while we were given Tea and some Chips & Crispy Noodles, which we later found to be various Soba-made deep-fried appetizers accompanied by a Miso dip possibly with Plum.   3.5 *Star*It was an easy decision to make when the Menu had some items that noted ""Chef's Recommendations"" which was the Okonomi Soba($20.00) that provides a Oboro Tofu Soba wile including your choice of 2 flavours out of the 4 given(Tororo, Oroshi, Snow Crab, Ikura Roe)OBORO TOFU - Favourite that comes standard in the Okonomi Soba order.  Soft Silky Tofu mounted the Soba and Tsuyu underneath.  It's my favourite because the Tofu didn't obstruct the Soba/Tsuyu therefore you can taste the Soba in it's natural form.  Soba has miniscule grooves that help carry the Tsuyu but at the same time it was smooth with excellent SLURP slipperiness.TORORO - Puree of Yamaimo (Japanese Yam).  Think Natto or snot consistency which adds an extra level of slippery slurpness to the Soba however the texture and feel might not be for the uninitiated.ORISHI - Grated Daikon Radish.  This provides a slight freshness to the Tsuyu while also slightly hot since it was raw Radish.IKURA ROE - This one had some Oroshi as the anchor.  Along with some Wasabi this one reminds me of Goshiki Natto at Izakayas.  Btw, I love Wasaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabi.SNOW CRAB - It had to be my least favourite personally.  Probably because it didn't unite with the Noodles as well as other offerings while Oboro was just good.After the Soba Mains we were given Soba-yu(Warm water that boiled Soba).  Think of it like the Spaghetti water but less thick in density.  I consumed it as a Tea of sorts.  I served my Masters well as the assigned Geisha serving the SOBA-YU.DESSERT - Buckwheat Porridge with Azuki Beans.  It was a nice end to the meal and it wasn't overly sweet.  A regular dessert however this one was made with Buckwheat.I give an extra 0.5 *Star* for Authenticity and the honor to get this chance to try Traditional Soba in the city of Toronto.  Arigato Gozaimasu!",4.0,4.0,11,2010-12-01,43.671283,-79.383888,"Japanese , Noodles"

One of my companions took heaps of photos so stay tuned!The owner, a former 'salaryman' who immigrated to Canada, does not have a shop of his own. Rather, he rents out the spaces of other establishments to sell his product. I remember when you could order his soba from Nakamura Bakery at J-Town.

Soba Canada,"The people at Soba Canada don't f*ck around.  They are serious -- serious about soba!  Despite its simplicity, the soba has immense integrity and I enjoyed my meal as much as I would've had I had an incredibly complex dish (with foam, gastrique, sou vied, and whatever have you).  I went with the zaru soba and oboro (house made tofu).  I don't really know how to express how amazing the soba is because it'll just sound like ""chewy noodles, fresh, umame, handmade, refreshing blah blah blah"".  So if anyone need convincing, they should watch that episode of No Reservations where Anthony Bourdain visits the Soba master.  I know it's not the exact same thing, but will get you in the mood for sure.  Apart from the fact that soba is tasty, it's also healthy, low-fat, organic, and vegan -- terms that I would normally hit with my car, get out, spit on them, get back into the car, back into it, before finally driving off.

Commercial soba bought on store shelves only requires a minimum buckwheat proportion of 30% to be legally called soba and often are at ratios of 30/70. The difference between the two is worlds apart and far tastier in this rendition.The price ranges from about 13-21 dollars and includes a small app, the bowl of soba itself, followed by a drink of sobayu (the water it was boiled in) mixed with tsuyu (the dipping sauce that was in the bowl of soba) and a dessert.",4.0,4.0,11,2010-08-12,43.671283,-79.383888,"Japanese , Noodles"

I came here for my birthday and I got the 5 course Omakase, consisting of sashimi, a variety of seafood (oysters, seared scallop, etc) prime rib, sushi plate, and 3 desserts. While the price is steep, it is very worth it for the experience and expertise of the staff there, which obviously translates over to the food itself. If it is your first time going, I would definitely recommend one of the omakase menus (kind of like a tasting menu!), as you have the chance to sample many of the menu items.

A little pricey for lunch, but well worth it if you're in the area.Overall 5 stars!!!!",4.0,5.0,473,2018-01-09,43.641235,-79.37737,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Miku Toronto,"As usual I have nothing but good things to say about this place!!! 10/10 for service, quality, taste, ambiance and cleanliness ! I am addicted to Sashimi/ Sushi. And this is my weekly go to. I suggest lunch is the best bang for your buck. The portions seem much larger during lunch, their dinner is more dainty and just a over charged price for mostly all the same stuff. Our main things is always Botan ebi, Uni, and hotate sashimi. We order the premium sushi plate to get a little taste of the oshi, aburi and sushi. Miku roll definitly our favourite with the flame seared fish top and rolled in tobiko! And for deep fried lovers definitly try the Ebi Fritters, with teriyaki and spicy mayo. Mmm mmm!Miku Chopped salad is so delicious with the Tempè, avocado, and pears.

Miku Toronto,"This is a tough review to write. I had a $100 gift card to Miku, and without it this review would be two stars, because this was definitely not a $200 dinner experience in my mind.I requested to sit at the sushi bar for a couple reasons: my husband and I prefer to sit next to each other, and generally the sushi bar is fun because you can interact with the chefs and watch them do amazing work.  Especially at a place known for torched sushi, how fun would that be to watch? We saw nada, however, because they built a concrete two foot wall in front of you at the sushi bar. Makes no sense. So yes we got to sit next to each other, but the sushi bar is near the front entrance and there's no ambiance there.I found service to be pressured and over eager. Server assistants, managers, our waiter, would sneak up behind us moments after popping a sushi in our mouths and ask if we were enjoying it. The waiter seemed almost angry that we didn't want dessert, ignoring us and launching into a detailed description about which was his favourite choice and why. The best order of the night was my pick of sake, from Oregon, that was delicious. It was served in a metal bucket...with no ice in it...just a metal bucket for no reason.  That was odd af. The torched square sushi that Miku is known for was the best. The rest of the sashimi and nigiri we had was mediocre. Not unfresh, just unflavourful. I like adventurous sushi (ikura is my fave) and have been to Japan, so I have an awareness of good sushi and this was not it.  The shari fell apart. No wasabi on anything but I longed for it, to kick up the flavour. Washrooms were pretty but dirty.  Four hosts on at the door, busy talking to one another when we entered. ""Coat check"" just a ploy to get you to tip.Cocktails were yummy and apparently 2 oz,  but I felt nothing. Our meal was meh, and $205. Thankfully we have the gift card!",4.0,3.0,473,2018-01-06,43.641235,-79.37737,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Miku Toronto,"Came here for a birthday surprise ... my birthday surprise lol. Walked into the restaurant to see one of my buddys go ""oh-shit"" LOL..We were in the private room and when everyone arrived and was settled down the server came by to explain the basis of the menu. After looking thru the menu and haven our drink orders taken we waited for the server to come back annnnd waited and waited. I'm sure it wasn't her fault as we had a big group and she wanted everyone to have a check to go thru the entire menu but I was kinda in a rush because I had to be somewhere (and the rest of the group) promptly after dinner. The food arrived shortly after and everything was not short of an amazing! I got the premium sushi sampler which showcased a piece of their ""best selection"" , the miso sablefish, and o-toro sashimi (mahhhh favvvvv). I can say that I did enjoy everything but at the same time I felt like there could've been slightly more to it, can't specially say what it was but something felt missing :(. The service thru out dinner service was good our waters were always filled and we were checked up on a few occasions but not too often where it seemed pushy only negative I could say with the service was the long wait for our food order to be taken. I always justify the price of something for the quality and value. As I mentioned earlier ""something felt missing""with that being; it was a little pricey for what I got. I will return though because there are other items on the menu I really wanted to try but there was no way I was going to eat that much food and then go out and drink heavily.

Miku Toronto,"I've been high anticipating the day of my Miku visit and it has finally arrived!We ordered the Miku roll, Miku zen (4 salads and 5 pieces of sushi), and the Aburi lunch set. By far my favourite item would have to be the aburi salmon and tuna. The fish was still extremely tender despite being torched, and completely melts in your mouth. For the aburi salmon, I loved the surprising hints of flavour in each - the kick from the jalepeno in the aburi salmon and the zest of the lime in the tuna was absolutely fantastic. I would have preferred more fish on each piece though.The 4 salads in the Miku zen were just so-so. I felt that it wasn't value for money, especially when coupled with a mere 5 pieces of sushi came up to $29. As for the Miku roll, I did enjoy how the generous amount of salmon roe provided the salty flavour and texture. However, I was expecting something more unique for a namesake roll. All in all, I would come back here on special occasions and load up on aburi sushi!",4.0,4.0,473,2017-11-05,43.641235,-79.37737,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Miku Toronto,"I love this place.  My first experience was in Vancouver at Miku and was excited when they opened in TO.  Expect to pay premium but I feel you get more than you pay for.  I would rank this a high end Japanese experience.  Asahi draught which is a great japanese beer and a wide range of saki and whiskey selection.Food and drink is expedient and rarely delayed.  Staff are welcoming and friendly and give great recommendations.  If you like fresh fish and oysters come here.  We had a range of selections from beef carpacio, o Toro sashimi, same and hirame sashimi, and some of their kuburi dishes.  I personally love to start with their spicy edamame.The only thing I see missing from the menu is hirame (fluke / flat fish).  It is hard to find but a Japanese restaurant at this level should have it available in my opinion.I continue to recommend to at least try Miku.",4.0,5.0,473,2018-01-09,43.641235,-79.37737,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Miku Toronto,"I have been here twice now, and the food here has not disappointed. Everything is very well executed. Great ambiance, attentive service.We ordered a number of dishes to share:Appetizer/snack:Albacore tuna and wakame tartareSmoked soy grilled octopusPan seared scallopsSpicy sesame edamameAll of the above were very delicious. Each plate has so many different sauces and sides, with a variety of flavoursEntree:Kyoto saikyo miso baked sablefishKaisen soba peproncino - I wasn't sure what to expect from the description of this dish, but it was very very good. Soba with a sauce and lots of seafood. It was nicely seasoned and the soba was so flavourful. This was like a fusion of japanese/chinese/italian.Sushi:Salmon oshi sushiEbi oshi sushi (prawn)Saba oshi sushi (mackerel)Yum, torched sushi. The mackerel one was my least fav. The prawn one tastes fresh as it has lemon flavour. Salmon one has some salmon inside the rice in addition to on top.Rolls:Red wave rollSoft shell crab fritter rollMiku rollThe standout out of these three was the Miku roll. Torched roll with fish eggs giving the outside a crunchy texture. The soft shell crab roll was delicious as well - has the crunch and also comes with two pieces of soft shell crab in addition to the roll. The red wave roll was our least fav as it did not stand out in terms of flavour and I felt it had too much rice.Dessert:Green tea operaWarm valrhona matcha chocolate fondantIchigo mochi domePassonfruit mousse and sake frozen yogurtThe standout FOR SURE was the chocolate fondant. So so so good. The matcha chocolate inside. The jasmine tea ice cream. The rice crisps. Everything about that plate is perfection. The green tea opera was quite dense, and tasted of hazelnut chocolate and matcha. The mochi dome I wasn't a huge fan of as it tasted like jam/jelly on mochi.The passionfruit mousse was ok. Not too memorable.I tried a sip of the aburi(?) cocktail and it was a bit sweet for my liking.Overall Miku is great for a lovely night out.",4.0,4.0,473,2017-10-28,43.641235,-79.37737,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"

We got the pickled vegetables, the beef carpaccio, the pressed sushi, uni nigiri and two mixed plates of different sushi's (can't remember the name). Every dish was amazing and the fish tasted soooooo fresh. The rice was so flavourful and moist. The service was amazing as well because they take the time to explain to you what's on your plate.

Miku Toronto,"Came here twice for birthday celebrations and the service was great.  The atmosphere was very chic, sophisticated, but you'll also see some casually dressed diners as well with their kids/families.  They also offer a small scoop of ice cream for birthday celebrations or if you order one of their dessert items, then they'll write your name on the plate in chocolate and add a candle! Their matcha chocolate ganache cake was delicious!I really enjoyed having their aburi sushi and their rolls were good too.  There seems to be a lot of detail that goes into their food it's a twist on your traditional sushi restaurant. The flavours melt together so well once they hit the palate and it's those small details that make this place so unique.Miku is definitely more expensive than typical Japanese restaurants and they serve omakase here too.  I would really only come here for a special occasion or maybe for a snack and not to get full because you're bound to spend about $150 on food/drinks here.",4.0,5.0,473,2017-10-13,43.641235,-79.37737,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"

Miku Toronto,"May 2016: Knew about this Japanese restaurant import from Vancouver. First time here was a surprise Mother's Day brunch. The place was a little hard to find and although there were many doors the only entrance to the restaurant was the one connected to the main lobby. They had a special brunch menu with their signature items. Ordered the special Mother's Day brunch menu, asparagus prosciutto salad, their twist on steak and eggs and green tea opera cake dessert. Also ordered off the menu for the premium aburi sushi platter. My husband got the ebi fritters and seafood aburi sushi and blood orange sorbet. We both got the Yuzu mimosas. The food was amazing from presentation to the taste. Lives up to its west coast roots and a great addition to the Toronto restaurant scene. Very kid friendly as well they had a soba soup noodle available for young children and we requested they add chicken to the soba noodle which they had no problem doing. Also had available vanilla ice cream (made from scratch) for my happy toddler. Service was spectacular. There are no other Japanese restaurants in Toronto serving aburi sushi and quality Japanese fusion dishes. Will definitely go back to try the other dishes soon.Dec 2017: Since my first visit in 2016 when it opened I've been coming here regularly for both lunch and dinner. This place is consistently a top notch modern Japanese restaurant. The food is modern Japanese fusion, sushi Aburi style and traditional cuisine. I've tried pretty much all the items on their menu. The last two times I was here: one was a dinner with friends celebrating a birthday. We had the calamari, sashimi selection portioned for 8 people, the poached lobster entree, sablefish, prime rib entree. The food and presentation was amazing. It's consistent every time I'm here. For dessert we had green tea open cake, Mochi dome, matcha chocolate fondant, sake frozen yogurt. Last week I had lunch here and ordered al la carte sashimi (scallop, toro, sockeye salmon) and uni nigiri, oysters and the lunch premium sushi platter. Restaurant is pricey but you get quality Japanese cuisine and in a upscale ambiance. Service is friendly and attentive. Love their cocktails.

Miku Toronto,"I came to this place with colleagues for a team lunch and having heard good things about this place, I thought it was going to be really good.  Maybe I've had too much sushi, I didn't find it special.I know it's very unfair to compare this place to an AYCE restaurant but the gap between AYCE places and authentic sushi places have never been closer.  I'm sure the quality of the fish is better here but can you really tell the difference?  Sushi platter i ordered for lunch is good but torched sushis at AYCE places are just as good.  The one thing that disappointed me a little was the colour of the fish on the sushi looked a little dark as if they were left uncovered for a while.  The photos didn't turn out as good, my wife was like they don't look very fresh when I posted them on social media.Anyways that's not point, you come here for a better dinning experience, it's a higher end place.  This is a place for dates or business.I don't think someone will come this place for the first time and say it's the best sushi they've ever tasted.  You get it.",4.0,3.0,473,2017-09-13,43.641235,-79.37737,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"

Beans and mushrooms were packed full of flavor, toast was perfectly toasted with butter.The other stuff:- Brunch was on the pricier side for my wallet (Well - you decide: $17 for a full breakfast, although other items like eggs benny start at $13.)- I'm not sure how I feel about Anne Boleyn, but there are a lot of pictures of her so *shrugOverall, really good comfort food and has a real chill vibe despite the posh interiors.

I've walked past this British pub a dozen times and always wanted to try it out, so it worked out perfectly that they were open for brunch.Given that it was Jan 1, it was a fairly quiet day at the restaurant. Service was a little bit slow, but again, it was a holiday so it was understandable. We ordered the English Breakfast and a mushroom toast. I was a little surprised that they could only serve the eggs in the English Breakfast sunny side up or over easy, but not scrambled (how hard is it to scramble an egg?) As well, my friend had ordered her eggs over easy, but they came sunny side up. We didn't make a complaint because the over easy eggs at the table next to us did not look too appealing.

The nachos were a big serving, their chips were slightly flavored like doritos which was good. There was also a big pile of iceberg lettuce on top, but it could have used a few more toppings.

We came for a late dinner on a weekday and was promptly greeted at the front door. There was a game on, so the bar side was rowdy with cheering but the host was sensitive enough to ask if we wanted a quieter area (yes we did). The right side of the restaurant, by the wall-to-wall glass case of books was a much nicer and quieter space to have dinner. I had the chicken pot pie with a fennel salad. Both were delicious, with the chicken pot pie catching the attention of the neighboring tables because the puff pastry was so tall. The filling for the pie was a little on the soupier side, so ask for a spoon before the waitress wanders off.

The Anne Boleyn,"I found this place in a write-up on CTV of where Prince Harry might go for brunch while he's in T.O. and mayyyybe this may have had a lot to do with choosing it for our own brunch. Yep, we're those people. Well, actually it was 2/6 of us. However, has he actually come here or are they just assuming he will come here because, well, English pub and royal namesake? In that case I'm sure Meghan Markle has other haunts that he can't get at home; thus I am feeling fooled. Annnyways, The Anne Boleyn is a really nice, spacious and super well decorated establishment. We came here on a Saturday morning for brunch, and it was quite relaxing. They have a lot of space inside and outside on their patio. We had the choice of which area to sit in and I wish we had chosen ""The Library"". The library has floor to ceiling bookshelves adorned with many old books. There was no one seated there when we arrived, so we could have had that nook to ourselves. Next time! The rest of the space was equally as nice in its own right with plush bar stools, round about booths and gold tables. The silverware is also especially detailed and nice. The place felt stylish but comfortable. Several TVs were playing soccer and football games. I had the Full English Breakfast for brunch ($17) and a mimosa. It came with a large slice of toast, eggs (sunny side or over easy), mushrooms, tomatoes, brown beans, pork sausage, hash browns and bacon. It was delicious. I forgot how much I love brown beans at breakfast. Everything was fresh and piping hot. The hash browns reminded me of the ones at McDonalds but I'm not complaining, those are my fave. I wish they had mustard with the pork sausage, I didn't think to ask. Coffee was pretty good, but they don't have cream, only homogenized milk. I was let down at first because I really hate milk in my coffee, but was pleasantly surprised. It actually tasted fine! My mimosa was also delicious. Note: they are unable to serve alcohol before 11, so we had to wait about 10 minutes to get our boozy brunch beverages. Say that three times fast. Oh, and the caesar was good, but fyi spicy for those who have a somewhat sensitive palate to it. The service was pretty good. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, but there was a couple times we would run out of coffee and water and had to ask for it. Which is usually fine but I was dehydrated and headachy, ok, hungover and really needed it. They ended up leaving a pitcher of water on the table which was appreciated, and would still come back to help fill the glasses which was nice. Verdict: I would come back for brunch or even lunch/dinner; and to try more cocktails. They have quite a few solid choices.

From the outside I thought I had the wrong place because it looks like a swanky hotel, but inside is amazing and surprisingly different - very Gastro-pub looking with a great mix of modern and historic decor. The staff are super friendly - they even offered immediately to change one of the TVs (they have tons showing plenty of games) to the specific game my boyfriend was looking for. The food was awesome - I had the full English breakfast which was very true to Home (I grew up in London) and a generous portion of everything. My only, tiny complaint was that they don't do any menu substitutions which included when I asked if the eggs could be scrambled - they only made them sunny side up. Not a huge deal.My boyfriend got the eggs Benedict which he told me were the best he had ever had - I've literally never heard him say that about anything, and he normally makes fun of me for saying that about everything. So I guess they were great.If we lived in Toronto I'm sure this would become our 'local' because with the modern pub vibe, great food and drinks, friendly service plus all the sports TVs it's really perfect and reminds me a lot of London.",4.0,5.0,24,2017-10-15,43.648229,-79.393067,"Pubs , British"
The Anne Boleyn,"I went there recently for a bit of a last minute Saturday brunch with a few friends who were visiting from out of town. My girlfriend had also learned that it might be a favourite spot for Prince Harry, so she was hoping to run into him. Sadly, there was no Prince there. Although we had a lovely time. We were a party of 6 and they gave us an option of where we wanted to sit. Outside, beer hall, or library. The beer hall with all the TVs tuned to English football matches and all of the fans watching intently so early in the morning made for a really nice atmosphere. Two people in our group had gluten sensitivity and the server and chef were very accommodating with making substitutions to help out and still give everyone a great brunch. The Full English was a pretty popular dish in the group. And I have to say, that's what I intend on getting on my next visit. The baked beans looked so good. I had the Corned Beef Skillet and it was delicious. I recommend it. A friend had the pancakes and they looked like they could feed 6 people. Fluffy and very tasty. I look forward to going back again. Although my only concerns with the service was that they bad no coffee cream (half and half). I know it is more of a North American thing so for perhaps authenticity's sake it isn't offered. The milk they serve is full cream (3.25%). I also would have liked some jams/preserves with the toast that comes with some breakfast options. And Brown Sauce for the sausa9ges. Along with the quality brunch fare and the nice selection of beers on tap to enjoy after 11am, they make a killer caesar. I'm not a fan of vodka in it and they were happy to make it a bourbon caesar instead. If you haven't had one yet, go ahead and try it. I'll wait.",4.0,4.0,24,2017-09-24,43.648229,-79.393067,"Pubs , British"
The Anne Boleyn,"Loved the old British decor of this pub, it definitely helps to elevate the pub experience. I dined here last night with a group of friends and watched the hockey game. Tall cans of beer were on special for $5 during the game which was a great deal! My boyfriend and I started with the crab cake, which was phenomenal. Perfectly fried with a generous amount of crab and an amazing remoulade; I wanted to order another... The beef short rib and burger, which I was lucky enough to get a taste of from friends around the table, were very good. Perfectly cooked burger and fall off the bone short ribs. My fish and chips were fried nicely, but had no seasoning whatsoever. I ended up adding salt, which is something that I should not have to do at a restaurant, especially when I order something fried.Overall, the food and drinks were great and the service was attentive and friendly. I will definitely return to have another crab cake.",4.0,4.0,24,2017-10-29,43.648229,-79.393067,"Pubs , British"
The Anne Boleyn,"This place recently opened up near my office.  Came here with some coworkers to check out the place for lunch, and again for after work drinks.Envrionment: The interior is quite unique. To the right of the main entrance the room is decorated like a study and in the main area a large open space with a mix of communal and intimate tables.  Everything is decorated in wood which gives the room a more traditional pub feel.  The outside is a large patio facing Richmond St, great for people watching.  The patio is also covered by shade so you can enjoy the hot weather with none of the glaring sunlight in your eyes if that's your thing.Food: They have a lunch special menu for the weekdays where you pick a sandwich and your choice of side salad.  I ordered a Reubon Sandwich with a Fennel salad which tasted amazing.  I've also had their Fish and Chips, pretty standard fish but some bomb fries.  FYI when ordering, the food and drink menus are separate and look fairly similar which is a bit confusing, you'll see what I mean when you come.Service: The staff was friendly and attentative, which was surprising cause it's a new establishment. In a lot of new places restaurants are still trying to figure out their groove but this place was on point.",4.0,4.0,24,2017-09-27,43.648229,-79.393067,"Pubs , British"

La Carnita,"I went to this restaurant after searching for casual, but fun restaurants to visit in Toronto. I love tacos, so this seemed like a great option. The ambiance was a cool vibe. Loud club music mixed with a hip trendy taco joint was a cool combination. All the decorations and the lighting also attributed to this vibe. The prices were a little expensive, especially the margaritas. I ordered a watermelon one, and it was tasty, unique and delicious don't get me wrong, but a little over priced. You are paying for the atmosphere and he concept of a unique taco menu more than anything, but sometimes it is worth it. In this case I would say that is was. The location seemed a bit small and there was not good place to wait especially in the cold temperatures. Overall, it was really fun to try if you are looking for something different.",4.0,4.0,448,2018-01-21,43.656012,-79.409684,Mexican
La Carnita,"I've been here twice (once in May 2014 and more recently on November 3rd 2017) and the John St. location a few times.The first time I went to this location was back when La Carnita only had one location on College Street.  And it was LOUD.  I couldn't really have any conversations with my friends because it was so packed and the music was loud -- basically had to shout the conversations even though my friends sat pretty close.I'm guessing that, due to expansions, the College Street location isn't as packed as it was back when they first started out.  Came here on a Friday night close to 6:00pm after catching a movie in the afternoon and it was about 60% full.  Waitresses and waiters were attentive and the food came out pretty quickly, so it was good.  The restaurant did progressively get more busy as the night went on, but I think my friend and I arrived just before the dinner rush.Ordered a lot of classic tacos and I ended up getting churros for dessert.  Food is just as good as the John St. location and the same as I remember, so I'm definitely coming back!",4.0,4.0,448,2017-11-19,43.656012,-79.409684,Mexican

The vibes inside are incredible, with a dim lit atmosphere and great music. The tacos were slightly overpriced for the size of them, but they tasted absolutely delicious.

La Carnita,"We came in here while visiting Toronto for a weekend. The place looked lively and we liked the sugar skull signage outside. We sat at the bar and had a few margaritas and a set of tacos.    The bartender was nice but not overly friendly or chatty.. he was however, attentive and took good care of us. The margaritas are really good here. I ordered mine with mezcal which in my opinion makes it even better. I love the smoky flavor the mezcal brings to a drink.   We had a few tacos with our drinks, I forgot all of what we had but I know there was a cod one and a maybe a carnitas.. either way they were all tasty and a nice way to finish out our outing.

La Carnita,"If you're a gin lover, La Carnita has one of the best gin with cucumber cocktails.We ordered their nachos with all 3 dips - guac, salsa, and beans. I felt like all 3 dips were done very well and was delicious with the nachos. Then we got all of the tacos besides Crispy Cojita (I believe it's vegetarian). It was definitely filling and yummy, but I wasn't getting too much of the ""Mexican"" from it; in other words, after eating so much Mexican in the past year, food here at La Carnita is very American-ized and de-Mexicaned. So if you're not a big fan of Mexican but want tacos, this is a potential spot to check out.Service gets a lot slower when the place starts to fill up.Hipster and casual atmosphere, you can either dress up or dress down.",4.0,3.0,448,2017-04-11,43.656012,-79.409684,Mexican
La Carnita,"I've been to both the John st and College st locations now and both have been excellent! My only real complaint is that I couldn't get anyone on the phone even though I tried multiple times. Normally this wouldn't be a problem but since the second time I ate at La Carnita, I was making a reservation for myself and a friend with several severe allergies, it would have been nice to have been able to confirm that they could serve someone with numerous allergies rather than risk having to leave once we got there. Luckily, they were able to accommodate the food restrictions and the waitress was really great about letting us know what the kitchen could do for us! We ordered one of each of the tacos and the food arrived fairly quickly and everything was delicious. Pricey but worth it. The atmosphere was great, the music was great and I will definitely be going back.My experience at the John st location was quite a while ago but similar: great food and service but they had a live DJ and offered us some specials since they had recently opened.Easy 4.5/5 for La Carnita.",4.0,4.0,448,2017-10-16,43.656012,-79.409684,Mexican

Not the waitress' fault though.Dark loud atmosphere. Very narrow stairs down to the washrooms. Packed with people.Tortilla chips with all three dips - fav is corn salsa, followed by spicy bean queso and guac. This was similar to doritos, not tostitos as it had more spice/flavour. Extra $5 for all three dips is too much.Mexican street corn was yummy, a bit spicy and a bit cheesy, but overpriced.Tacos: In cod we trust taco = great with the green apple slices, Pollo frito fried chicken taco = liked the mole sauce but serving size is smaller, Beef cheek taco = yummy braised beef and liked the spicyness.Desserts: Tres leche cake was served in a jar, both sweet and sour, pretty good.

Yes the fish tacos are as good as everyone says - I would def recommend them. The guacamole was REALLY yummy! They also dust the tortilla chips with some spicy taco mix so they can get a bit spicy for some, however my whole table really enjoyed them. The place gets really packed and there didn't seem to be enough servers to go around, so service was not fantastic, but the actual waiter was very very nice and friendly.

They don't sit you until the whole party gets there, so a friend and I had to wait for 2 other people to get there. Since its small, we waited by the bar. When my friends got there, there weren't any tables left! so we had to sit by the bar and with four people it sucks for socializing.Then one by one we noticed big groups come in and be seated right away! Instead of telling us, ""hey, we have a table if you want to move to it"" they just forgot us :( The food was really good though so it made up for the uncomfortableness of the bar stools.

Plenty of chips, home-made, crisp, and dusted in ancho chilli powder. The dip was rich and peanut like. A good choice.The pollo frito taco was excellent. Very full, plenty of crisp chicken. The fried cod and red cabbage taco was also good, not too greasy and slightly soft.The meatballs were beautifully spiced and rich, plenty of them.The carne assada was also excellent.Overall we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of food.

Not once did our waitress ask if we were doing ok,  not once did she ask if we wanted refills on our drinks, instead we had to remind her of them twice. Mind you, the place was NOT busy so I don't know what the deal was...Our churros were stale, my food drenched in condiments rather than any shrimp at all and our bill came to a hefty 350$ with a generous 50$ gratuity charge..

Bua Thai Restaurant,This review is for the takeout only. This was a last minute choice as the perennial fav for take out/delivery wouldn't deliver at the friend's place we were dinning. This place is right around the corner so we decided to pick up from here. Initial impression for the restaurant was pleasant and its a nice clean place with plenty of seating. Word of advise though you they don't use the same names for the popular dishes so it is suggested one go through the description and the rice is extra.Pick up was easy and there is a discount if you pay cash. The food was packed well.  Here is a play by playSoups were good or maybe it was the cold weather that elevated the dishMango salad good as well and better than the popular spot IMOPeanut curry (Panang) hmm this is a fav but was disappointing. The texture was of a cross between the satay sauce and curry sauce one associates with this dish. Hmm not pleasant at all.Young Coconut curry. Average and it was hard to identify the curry taste. Red Curry was decent and much better than the other options here.Coconut shrimp were OK.Pad Thai. Below average.Hmmm with a standard being set high in Toronto for mainstream Thai take out/delivery I think they have their work cut out for them. 2.5 stars for the take out experience.,4.0,3.0,35,2017-12-10,43.67485,-79.396803,Thai

I alternate between their green chicken curry and pad thai. I feel like you can determine whether or not a Thai restaurant is good by trying their pad thai, and Bua Thai's pad thai noodles are so saucy, chewy, and overall delicious. It's often dead in the restaurant when my coworkers and I come in for lunch (around 12pm-1pm). They have very attentive service.

Bua Thai Restaurant,"I'm not sure why this restaurant is so highly rated - I pretty much compare every Thai place to Pai in downtown, which is both authentic and uses great authentic ingredients. I thought I'd try it out - so I ordered the Pad Thai, Red Curry with roasted Duck, and Tom Yum Soup. First, the soup was really not that deep or flavourful. It wasn't really very tangy at all - the lemon and galangal/ginger flavour was pretty low. The soup doesn't even have any heat. There were also no sliced red chilis, tomatoes, onions, and the deep flavour of real lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves and I suspect the fish sauce was on the low side - it needed more salt. Oh, the whole button mushrooms were actually wilted and the shrimp was rubbery - definitely NOT good. I suspect it was sitting in the soup all day rather than put in as the final inclusion. This was the most disappointing item on the menu. If you want Tom Yom soup, go to Pai and you'll never go back to eating this version of it. The Pad Thai was better - it tasted good, but it wasn't really Pad Thai. The dish is still fine, but I don't think they are using Tamarind, and it's not as garlicy and savoury as a more authentic version. It was also pretty dry - especially the chicken, which was probably pre-cooked, drained of all of its savory juices and simply warmed into the stir fry. They didn't use Ban Pho noodles - they opted for more thinner noodles. The red curry was pretty bland. The Taste of Thailand version is strictly superior. Theirs was creamy, but it just lacked depth and warmth, probably to not using a very authentic curry paste. What burns me is that store purchased ones are actually much better. It's not that hard to use the Maesri brand, which is actually quite good, if you can't make your own. I'm not sure what happened here, so I was also disappointed. The portions were also pretty small. That is not something I would really mention if my mind was blown away by the quality of the food, but considering my other disappointments, it's also worth mentioning. I expect to have a lot of leftovers for the next day, but there is far less than half of the total amount of food for lunch. I realize they really aren't that many great Thai places in Etobicoke - I wish Pai was out here instead of downtown Toronto - but Taste of Thailand, while not being authentic, is at least much more chefy and more flavourful in all aspects, and the prices are basically the same, you should probably just order from there. But if you really have time in your day, just go get Pai... it's SOOO much better.",4.0,2.0,35,2017-01-22,43.67485,-79.396803,Thai
Bua Thai Restaurant,"Food is good. Me and my partner both had the Pad Thai, it was pretty sweet but tasted good. Satay was great (as great as one can expect outside of SEA). Desserts -- we had a mango sticky rice, great value, but God, it's a lot to eat..., and deep fried bananas. Those were amazing.Not a fan of the 15% service charge, even for the two of us! Be careful if you're using credit as they bring you up to the front and you don't get to see your receipt until you're at the machine. You'll see the service charge in there at the bottom after the tax. Careful or you might tip twice!Overall, the food is worth it.",4.0,4.0,35,2017-03-02,43.67485,-79.396803,Thai

Bua Thai Restaurant,"The food here is amazing. Each dish we ordered was different from the other and we enjoyed a fantastic flavour melange. Particular favourites were the fried snapper in red curry and the basil pad thai with tofu.What would have been an excellent dining experience was overshadowed by some of their billing practices. Two items were listed on our bill for a couple dollars higher than the menu price and were corrected by our server when we brought them up.Also, a 'service charge' of 15% was automatically added to our bill. While this may have made sense if we were a larger group, there were just 3 of us. The charge wasn't disclosed to us, and had we not checked, we would have been paying tips twice.

Bua Thai Restaurant,"This is my absolute favourite Thai restaurant in the GTA.  I have eaten here at least 10x, and have yet to have a questionable experience.  The service is warm and friendly, the prices are reasonable (kind of cheap, actually) and the food is incredible.  My favourite dish is the peanut chicken curry, which is a bit like red curry, but even better.  It's one of the Friday specials, but the cool thing about this place is that for an extra dollar or two, you have have the specials on the days when they aren't specials (if that makes sense).  Always be sure to specify that you want veg in your curry b/c sometimes it comes with just meat (weird, but whatever).",4.0,4.0,35,2015-10-26,43.67485,-79.396803,Thai
Bua Thai Restaurant,"Really yummy food. We ordered delivery and really enjoyed everything. We got spring rolls, mango chicken, and beef coconut curry. (As another reviewer mentioned there were no veggies in the curry so just ask for them if you want them.) I'm not sure what the exact name of those meals are- I called in a hurry on moving day and had them help pick for me what to order because I had no time to look it up online. They were nice enough to choose for me and the person on the phone was patient with me when my phone kept hanging up on him.Delivery arrived quickly and everything was hot and yummy. I had the beef the next night heated up in the microwave and it was even really good the second night.

Bar Sybanne,"Delicious food and great atmosphere! Came here for dinner on a weekday between Christmas and New Years and it was packed. The restaurant is cozy and great for a girls night out or date night. The food is tapas style and great for sharing. My friend and I ordered a few dishes to share: beet dip, fish crudo, halloumi, fried chicken, saffron rice, and the seasonal fruit. Our favourites were the beet dip and fried chicken. The beet dip was made with yogurt and spice and served with housemade Turkish flatbread. The flatbread arrived warm and we ordered additional flatbread just to scoop up the remaining beet dip. The fried chicken was juicy and flavourful, the orange blossom honey drizzled on top was amazing (I wish they sell the honey so I can bring it home). We also tried two cocktails - Satie and Co. and English Basilica. Both were well crafted and tasted amazing. Overall, the service was good and we had a great time.

Bar Sybanne,"We recently had dinner at cosy Bar Sybanne and it was a nice experience overall.Cocktails were quite good and so was the food.  The only reason I'm giving this review four stars is due to the fact that the hummus was not a home run for me; it was too chunky for my liking and good hummus to me is the holy grail dish in any middle eastern/Lebanese cuisine. The fried chicken, tartare, halloumi and lebneh spread were all excellent. I would come back again. Reservations highly recommended.",5.0,4.0,32,2017-12-23,43.649105,-79.42055,"Mediterranean , Middle Eastern , Bars"
Bar Sybanne,"WHAT TO TRY??!The fried chicken, the eggplant dip, the saffron rice, the steak tartare, the fish of the day and the apple cake!The fried chicken was crunchy with some sweetness, perhaps from honey but it was interesting. Comes in bite sizes but I have to warn you, the portion sizes run on the small side because this restaurant is tapas style so you might want to order another order if your party size is big. The eggplant dip is also delish. Served with gozleme which is a Turkish flatbread. Additional gozlemes cost $3 so don't think it's bread and it's free for all! The steak tartare was amazing too. Served with crunchy gozleme, the steak tartare tasted fresh and very flavourful. Lots of good ingredients mixed in there I bet in order to really draw out the flavors of the steak bits! The fish of the day is different every time. We were served a seabream with textures similar to a sea bass. Very simple grilled fish, but it's nicely complemented with Romesco sauce, salt and lemon on the side. Romesco sauce has a tomato base which is very flavourful. The saffron rice was very pretty with color and different ingredients. Definitely had a lot of saffron in the dish. The only feedback is the rice was a bit over cooked and there were clumps of rice in the dish. For dessert, we got all three! I personally liked the apple cake the most because it's the most unique dessert at the restaurant. It also is their most popular one too! It's a Moroccan spiced cake with spiced ice cream on top. The cake was spicy! Now isn't that different? It's interesting, you should try it to see if you like it! All plates are meant to be shared because of the tapas nature of the dishes. The plates are unique too with lots of different designs. Decor of the restaurant is cute and cozy. If you're wondering, the name Sybanne actually comes from combining the chef's two grandmother names together - Sybal and Anne hence Sybanne. You can also find their portraits on the wall. They were the inspirations for the chefs dishes.LAST TIP?!Make reservations because this restaurant isn't too big and it gets really busy around dinner time! They've only been open for three months so it's still a relatively new restaurant in the Ossington strip! The best seat in the house is definitely at the back with the coaches and cushions. Your party has to be five people though! There's two such seatings in the back so when you make your reservations, you can request for those seats!",5.0,4.0,32,2017-12-23,43.649105,-79.42055,"Mediterranean , Middle Eastern , Bars"
Bar Sybanne,"When a tummy starts to have a growl for Mediterranean, my Toronto restaurant list was pretty limited but my yelp search showed up the new Bar Sybanne.  With it's many fresh 5 stars, this seems to be very promising and I would say that my Saturday dinner here didnt disappoint.The atmosphere here is modern and clean with a touch of warmth & intimacy.  Though they have a nice bar area with a few seatings and a good drink list, I would say that this Mediterranean tapas is more upscale than a simple bar.  As the evening progressed, it got fairly dark but the candlelight on each table and dimmed lightning created a nice ambiance.  Service here was friendly and welcoming.  The hostess was pretty hilarious as she asked each table for the gossip on why the group was dining out that night.  The menu is simple but flavours are richly complex than what it reads.  We were told that it was good to aim for 3 to 5 dishes depending on where we chose on the menu.  We decided on a few dips, vegetables, and 2 meat mains.  We were told that it should be enough for us and though I would say I wasn't starved leaving... it is a bit on the lighter side.Hummus dip - Lovely smooth with a nice helping of sumac and za'atar spices to keep it interesting.  The freshly grilled flat bread was the perfect way to eat it up... I will admit that we ran out of bread far faster than eating all the dip.  4/5Eggplant dip - OH WOW... ok, this was very surprisingly good.  The addition of the caramelized cippolini onions and maple syrup took this from creamy and simple to savoury sweet flavour bomb.  I loved this.  We only got one small flat bread per dip and like the hummus, we ran out of bread ... key tip, use the crispy chicken to dip this into!  5/5Brussels Sprouts - A simple vegetable dish... not at all.  Put all your preconceptions about this vegetable cause what Bar Sybanne does with it is very good.  Shredded and then fried crispy and laced with crunchy nuts and tossed in a rich sweet date sauce.  Another vegetable winner where the tastes would satisfy even the hungriest carnivore 5/5Daily Fish ... Sea Bass - This was grilled nicely... soft tender white flesh with a bit of romesco sauce and lemon to enhance.  I will tell everyone that if you don't know how to debone yourself... this might be a challenge to eat.  Thank goodness I knew how to not completely butcher it so we can enjoy it.  4/5Fried Chicken - Someone did mention that this was a very small portion size and I can understand their concern.  It is on the smaller size (and we were told the meatballs was even smaller for the same price point).  I would say treat this more like a tasty snack instead of a main.  This execution is pretty good... crispy thin shell that yields nicely to tender pieces of chicken.  It isn't my favourite fried chicken (Kaarage takes that vote) but it is a good rendition.  Careful with some of the larger pieces.  We learned they were just big cause they had really big fatty pieces of chicken skin instead of meat.  Those pieces were just a tad oilier than others 4/5Overall, this is a great addition to Ossington hot dining scene.  Food is solid with several shining dishes.  Value wise, it's fair with some dishes being better than others (Fish is a great dish if you can debone it yourself).  And another great point to bring me back is the service... its a great balance of being welcoming and informed while still offering an upscale experience.",5.0,4.0,32,2017-11-08,43.649105,-79.42055,"Mediterranean , Middle Eastern , Bars"
Bar Sybanne,The spot is really cute and trendy. I liked the meatballs the best. And the lamb was yummy. My friends loved the beef tartare.

Bar Sybanne,"Fresh on my radar with consistently high praise, I knew I had to make reservations to venture out to Ossington and visit Bar Sybanne. Despite being relatively simple in decor, Bar Sybanne feels intimate and at the same time, slightly transposed with its basketweave light fixtures, Moroccan-inspired latticework panels throughout, European bone china flatware, high top tables at the front---understated and tasteful. Staff were very warm, knowledgeable, and thorough. Food arrived at a measured pace, never leaving too much pause in between. My girlfriend and I shared the house pickles, the crudo, the halloumi, the fried chicken, the Brussels leaves, a basilica and a coupe de grace.The house pickles were turnips that day, and were forwardly tart and served to engage our appetites. We then delved into the crudo which was steelhead trout for the day; very fresh, simple and paired very nicely with the slivers of pickled turnips. The halloumi was one of my favourites this meal---salty, blistered with crispy caramelization, with an interior texture pleasantly resembling half squeaky half melted poutine curds, and supported by the mildly tart and sweet marmalade and oregano, it was a dish that vanished quite suddenly. The fried chicken was good but paled compared to the other brighter and exciting dishes---tender, delicious batter. By far, however, the greatest surprise was the Brussels leaves. A wonderful play of textures with a gentle crisp of leaves, a nutty crunch from the almonds, and just an earthy and addicting fragrance, this dish was our favourite. Both drinks were very smooth and delicious, pairing very nicely with our dinner. The basilica, in particular, is dangerously smooth and would be my top choice on my next visit.My only regret is that I didn't arrive with as empty a stomach as I had wished, and hope to return for the dips and the baked whole fish, as well as to sample the other handcrafted cocktails.

Labneh had a very fresh taste to it. The humus was very good. The Israeli salad is finely chopped tomatoes onions etc with a sharp dressing. The Brussels leaves are crispy and unusual. I'm not the Tartare sort, but this one was mild and tender. The grilled fish was excellent, note: they prefer that you debone it yourself.

Bar Sybanne,"Bar Sybanne serves Mediterranean inspired food. The decor is cosy and has a Middle Eastern vibe. The service is attentive and friendly. The food is flavourful. The food is designed to be shared. It is best to go with a few people so that you can sample the different dishes. We ordered the flatbread with labneh, fried brussel leaves, saffron rice, daily fish, fried chicken, harissa meatballs, lamb kafta, Israeli salad, seasonal fruit and chocolate budino. The standouts were the fried brussel leaves, fried chicken, and saffron rice. The fried brussel leaves were done excellently. The leaves were crunchy - salty little flakes mixed with crunchy almond shards on top of date sauce that brings the whole dish together. The fried chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The savoury taste of the chicken is a nice contrast to the honey that is drizzled on top of the dish. The saffron rice is fragrant - mixed with dried apricot, sultanas and pistachios.  I would highly recommend Bar Sybanne.

Bar Sybanne,"I haven't reviewed anything in a while but perhaps that's because nothing has been notable lately until now. I came here for a casual birthday dinner with some friends and we were all super impressed with the food, service and overall experience.First off the staff had written a birthday card for me which was a really nice touch (ps: whoever writes the cards has amazing penmanship!). The service was warm, not overbearing and our glasses were never empty for long stretches of time. All of our drinks were amazing, really well crafted and beautifully presented.Now let's talk food. Wow this is place nailed every dish we ordered (or we just ordered all the best things lol). This is one of those menus where nothing is overly complicated or fussy and the ingredients just speak for themselves. The timing was also really spot on; they brought out 2 plates per course and I think they even pair the dishes accordingly as the items seemed to really compliment one another. We ordered the crudo, eggplant dip, meatballs, grilled mushrooms, fried brussels sprouts, lamb kofta, fried chicken, halloumi and budino. I think our favourites were the fried Brussels, lamb and mushrooms, but not a single disappointment in the mix! They were even kind enough to comp. the halloumi cause the kitchen forgot to send it (was corrected very promptly though), and they made no issue with accommodating me and my friend's nut sensitivities by having the kitchen send the nuts on the side instead of on top of certain dishes. The prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the food, service and ambience.

Bar Sybanne,"Every review speaks to how great the food is at Bar Sybanne. Recently opened, we weren't able to get a reservation for a Friday night at 7, but the waitress was nice enough to tell us to come by around that time and something might open up. Sure enough, our group of 3 was lucky enough to get a cozy table where we spent almost 5 hours catching up like good friends do.The menu is meant for sharing and the waitress was so patient with us. I started with the Basilica to drink - basil and egg white speak to me and this didn't disappoint. A hint of tartness, sourness, and the herbacious basil made it an instant winner.For sharables, we decided on the following:1. Eggplant spread with maple2. Beet dip with yogurt and spiceBoth came with housemade flatbread. While I love beet, I felt that the beet flavour could have come through more in this dip. Still very unique and enjoyable. The eggplant was delicious; it tasted fresh with very prominent pieces of eggplant with every bite. The flatbread was not oily and dense enough to hold the drip with every scoop.For Hot shares, we had the 3. Fried Brussel Sprouts4. Grilled Mushrooms5. The Daily FishBoth of these were delicious. The shredded brussels were fried with dates and almonds and it had different flavour profiles with each bite. I couldn't get enough of it! The grilled mushrooms were slices of king-oyster type steaks and I wish there were most slices because they were juicy with an aioli that kept you wanting more.The Daily Fish was a huge portion for 3 and it reminded me of how fish is prepared in a Chinese restaurant, bone in. Good thing one of us knew how to debone it! We were getting very full at this point but managed to eat most of it! I would definitely recommend this dish  - it was totally worth it. Cooked properly, not overdone, and very fresh.The dish I could have done without is the Ottoman Salad with Tahini Dressing. It tasted like coleslaw with creamy asian sesame dressing. I found it to be overly heavy, and nothing special.After a lovely meal, we couldn't leave without trying their dessert. We ordered a couple orders of apple spice cake with moroccan spice ice cream. The essence of Morocco really comes through with the cardamom flavours. The cake was super moist and was complemented with bits of apple and decadent and creamy ice cream.The more I write, the more I want to go back! I would have to say this was one of the best meals of the year. Nice addition to the Ossington strip!",5.0,4.0,32,2017-11-18,43.649105,-79.42055,"Mediterranean , Middle Eastern , Bars"

Skin+Bones,"I've always wanted to try this place and i figured that the tasting menu was the best way to try the food. Made reservations for 845 but ended up being 45 minutes late but they still were able to seat us. Decide is ready and not too formal. Lots if wood and dim lighting. Now to the food... Plenty of choices and lots of quantity. Started off with a Manhattan made with Basil Hayden's bourbon. It was well made and tasted very good.  Appy was the Charcuterie   Board. Very nice selection served with Crostini. 1st course was Mushroom Arancini ..nice and soft with a nice sweet sauce. 2nd up was a terrine served with pickled vegetables..firm but very tasty..could of had a little spice to it though. 3rd. Kale and quinoa salad ..never thought i would like  kale but it was oddly good..the dressing was nice and not too overpowering. 4th..The best part of the meal in my opinion was the Lamb shoulder pasta. It was served in a light cream sauce and had lots of flavour. The lamb shoulder was cooked to perfection and TBH, i could have had a full size portion and been happy..5th..Grilled pork chop served with grilled veggies..Nice and delicate and was lightly breaded. dessert was the Chocolate tort. Overall it was a great meal and the service was above the best. I would recommend sitting in the back dining room as the front one was a little loud with large parties. Parking wasn't a problem as there was plenty of spots on the street. Very pleased with the experience.

Skin+Bones,"I had never gone to this place but it was a suggestion that had some seriously positive reviews.We went for Sunday brunch. I expected it to be lined up outside but I lucked out in getting a spot before some others popped in behind me right after I walked in.The space is great. I had heard it might have once been a factory. THat being said it's still comfortable, welcoming and modern. Reminds me of space in Brooklyn called, Egg.I went with the daily frittata special of cauliflower, zucchini and bomba chili. It was spongy, yet solid. Great spring to this. It was a flavourful yet delicate combination. The chili was not noticeable - I was kinda hoping it would be. The mixed greens with balsamic vinegar dressing complimented it well but it wasn't say spectular.  I also ordered their house made sausage which disappointed me greatly because it was a patty instead. Maybe they ran out of casing? I wish I had known it before hand. I would have probably ordered the house made bacon instead.However, my friend ordered the S+B burger made with spicy aioli, bacon, fried egg, caramelized onion, cheddar and house made pickles plus a side of the most amazing crispy potatoes.  Loved this dish.....really wished I ordered this instead.  I can't say i would come here again for brunch but I'm curious about dinner.",4.0,4.0,166,2017-09-17,43.66142,-79.339734,"Bars , Canadian (New)"
Skin+Bones,"After my previous (average) experience at Skin + Bones, the restaurant got in touch with me to communicate that there had actually been a mix up in the kitchen. They sent me a gift card which enticed me to come back and give it another try. I recently went back for brunch and it was amazing! Service was prompt and friendly. All of the food was soo good. My friend and I got the Mushrooms on toast which was delicious. Our boyfriends got the S+B burger and the crispy pork Benedict and we got pancakes for the table. Soo good!

Skin+Bones,"It's a sunny Saturday morning and everyone is out lining up at their favourite brunch resto in Leslieville.  Skin and Bones wasn't our plan A, in fact, it wasn't even our Plan B!  We ended up here because our top choices had line ups that looks like a min hr wait so Skin and Bones was a no brainer. I bookmarked skin and Bones for dinner so i was happy to give their brunch a try. The ambience is good, very spacious with modern, clean decor. The prices are very fair, ranging $13 - $16 and you will see the usually breakfast suspects like egg Benny and fried chicken with waffle. I ordered the mushroom on toast with poach eggs and the Mr. got the breakfast special. My poached eggs were way over cooked but they replaced it right away, so that wasn't a problem. The only other complaint I have is my salad were drenched in dressing.

Skin+Bones,"Very unimpressed with this restaurant. I have heard this restaurant had a Sunday special for oysters so I decided to try it. I made a reservation for 5 people prior to coming here. When arriving they couldn't find our reservation in the system so they sat us at the bar while the host and the manager sort out stuff. Luckily enough, one person from our group couldn't come, so they had a table that was available. The catch was they had a reservation for that table in a hour and was expected to finish at that time. Was kinda turned off by this. After being seated, the waitress told us the specials they had. We were were only allowed to order a maximum of 12 oysters per person. This was kind of disappointing because we only came here for the oysters. We then ordered the maximum allotment. The oysters were really good and was very impressed with the sauce that came with it. After finishing our meal, the manager asked us how our meal was and asked if we wanted anything else. We said no and asked for the bill. He was slightly disappointed and made alot of passive aggressive remarks to us. After my group paid and was leaving the waitress said ""see you next week, probably not tho."" Which was very rude. It was the worst restaurant experience I had in a while. **Note to management - If messing up a reservation, act professional and own up to your mistake. Not throw them at a random table and rush them. Also expect customers  to order from daily specials on the menu and if they don't order anything else don't act rude towards them. You and your staffs snobby, pretentious attitude is unessacary and very unwelcoming.

Allow for 1.5 to 2 hours for the meal. My fave dishes as the beet salad, little mushroom ball (can't remember the actual name), pork (so tender), pasta (made in house), and the toffee pudding!

Bar Buca,"Bar Buca is the more affordable cousin of Buca down the street.  With a small square footage, this restaurant can only cater to small groups that are no larger than four diners.  It's a more intimate space with a classy atmosphere and modern decor, so this restriction in group size is well compensated.  In all  fairness, it creates the perfect vibe for dates. I enjoyed the 10 dollar drink and appetizer menu.  For an affordable price, you can receive a few ounces of wine/liquor/beer alongside a pleasantly plated personal appetizer.  I tried the nodini, tigella, and dumplings with pig's head. The flavours were not overpoweringly rich and the textures were not too soft, two critical turn offs for me when it comes to Italian food.  Therefore, for someone who doesn't appreciate Italian food as much as she should, I was thoroughly impressed with the quality. The servers were prompt, but nothing's perfect. They mixed up both my drink and food selections after they were brought out. Fortunately, they apologized and gave my entire party a shot of liquor on the house to make up for the mistakes.

Their coffee bar is located at the front of the store and there isn't a real line up area. Some times people just go up to the bar and order while you've been waiting at the cashier to order.

Bar Buca,"Coffee 5 starsService 5 starsSavoury dishes 5 starsBakery items 4 starsI think I found my favourite coffee place in Toronto!  Unexpectedly i came here late at night thinking a typical bar and was pleasantly surprised with a great cup of coffee, upscale reinvented Italian bar food, and great vibrant atmosphere.Off of Portland, Bar Buca can be seen by the dark emerald circle.  Once you walk in, the dimmed lighting, exposed concrete walls, and amazing wall of wine bottles just adds up to a great vibe.  The music was just the right amount.  We heard it can get very loud.  Seeing how the place was only half filled, it was not loud.  We can still hear the conversation.The service was a warm friendly smile who was very helpful to tell us their favourites on the menu.  We ordered a porchetta focaccia sandwich (WOW, one of the best sandwich I've had in a long time.  Juicy tender pork, zesty & sweet mustard, and creamy marscapone made for one hell of a perfect bite) and zucca (lightly battered and super crispy zucchini coins with a tangy goat cheese and ricotta to compliment... well done, though it was a touch heavier once it cooled).  I was incredibly surprised by the quality and flavours.  Just well executed overall and very reasonably priced.  I would love to return for a full meal instead of just a late snack.The coffee blew me away... I wasn't sure what I was expecting but the flavour, richness, and depth was surprising.  I loved how it wasn't overly sweet and could drink without any additional sugar.  We got the caffè con zabaglione latte (espresso with italian custard ... sooo soooo good) and caffè con zenzero latte (ginger syrup, cinnamon, and espresso).  They did have soy milk as an alternative.  Wow... just the flavours were very good.  And the prices were about the same as your corporate bland starbucks around the corner.  Definitely my favourite place for coffee now... I can't wait to try the ice blends or even their simple latte.For a last sweet bite, we grabbed a few of the bakery items.  It was late (11 pm) and I knew these items were sitting out for the entire day and perhaps that's why didnt they fully shine compared to the rest of the menu.  We had the amaretti (sweetest of the bunch but perfect sweet almond note with a softer centre with the crisp meringue like shell), pizelle (think upscale ice cream cone but masquerading as a cookie sandwiching chestnut paste.  Great cookie that isnt overly sweet), and cannoli (this is where it kinda went not so good... the shell was mostly soggy but the marscapone interior was very good.  Creamy, indulgent, good balance with the candied orange to let it shine... I just wish we didnt get it so late).Overall, this is a wonderful place to get very good food and phenomenal coffee in a great atmosphere without handing over many bills.  Definitely coming back and trying more.",4.0,5.0,201,2017-04-18,43.643923,-79.39984,"Bars , Italian , Breakfast & Brunch"

Not sure if it was because of the angle or the zoom, or if they actually shrunk the sizes of their food items (which I really hope is not the case). I tried one of the cocktails that was lavender flavored, can't remember the name but they had me a Lavender. It was horrible, I couldn't even drink half of it. It felt like I was drinking lavender oil. I've had a way better lavender flavored cocktail elsewhere. What's frustrating was the cocktail was pretty expensive too, around $12+, totally not worth it.Zucca ($8)Our waitress really recommended this, but it really was just fried zucchini topped with prosciutto bits. Nothing special.Burrata di buca ($16)Pesto stuffed mozzarella. This was just a huge blob of cheese - didn't even come with bread or crackers to eat it with. The waitress recommended us to order some fresh baked ciabatta bread to go with it but of course, at an additional cost.Amazza Fegato ($16)Tuscan offal sausage with king mushrooms served on the side.

In terms of flavor it was nothing special either, totally not worth the price.Prochetta Schiacciata ($14)Of all the items that my friends and I tried that night, I would say this was the only thing that actually tasted good.

Bar Buca,"We came here accidentally. Meaning, there is a bar that sounds similar and that's where we meant to go but we wound up here. It was pretty late on a Saturday night so we weren't able to sit outside, but we sat at the bar. We were immediately given menus and I noticed there are a lot of options and the wine list is pretty extensive. I ordered bistecca (steak) and asked for it to be cooked to medium. The host/our server looked at me as if I personally offended him. I get that some cuts of steak are best cooked to certain temperatures but the menu didn't describe the cut of the steak. If it said hangar steak I would have known not to ask for it to be cooked to medium. At any rate, his reaction definitely made me stop and just order something else. We opted for the short rib skewers and the garlic knots. The short rib skewers were good. The meat was super tender and flavorful. But $12 for 2 skewers is kinda crazy, and they weren't even long skewers. It probably was about 3 bites of food. The garlic knots were hard, maybe overcooked, so they didn't really soak up any of the oil they served it with.The service was ok, but I got the impression that this is a place where they are bougie for sure.

Bar Buca,"Came in for breakfast around 7:30am. Was surprised to find several people having meetings over coffee! Immediately after walking in, the barista kindly asked me what I wanted to drink and after ordering, I seated myself on the comfortable leather high chairs at one of the tables. The place gets pretty packed if you want to sit down around 8am but the servers assume that you're there for just coffee. We had to try and get the waitress' attention to get served which was a little hassle. We ordered the al orno and uova al pomodoro and it was seasonedbeautifully (slightly salty), Itaian style, with perfectly baked yolk-porn eggs. Mmm mmm good! The coffee had a good shot of espresso but not too intense which was also lovely. Would come back for breakfast again, the pastries also looked delicious.",4.0,4.0,201,2017-10-24,43.643923,-79.39984,"Bars , Italian , Breakfast & Brunch"
Bar Buca,"(3.5*) Came here for Winterlicious! We did not have a reservation so it took about 1 hour and 45 minutes to get seated but I was determined to try this place out because it was one of the very few itallian places I wanted to go to.We got the end seat at the bar close to the kitchen and our server was really delightful to speak to. I didn't get his name unfortunately but he wasn't itallian but his pronunciation of the dishes were endearing!We ordered all the appetizers because we had the choice of two which was Polenta, Testa, Barbabietole, Cicoria, the mains were Ammazza Fegato and Caponata con Cavolfiore, and we also had another choice of two for the dessert and had them all: Pizelle, Torta Cioccolatino, Amaretti Arancione, and Cantuccino.Me and my friend also ordered drinks: Gassosa Speziata & La Vita Nuova. The Gassosa Speziata was a house made grapefruit, tamarind, clove soda that was delightfully strong. The La Vita Nuova was a lovely cocktail with bacardi rum that i thoroughly enjoyed with my dishes :) Below I listed them in the order we recieved them.Polenta (4/5) They were crispy and deliciously spicy but I felt they were too oily.Testa (5/5)Fried Pig Head was so good in terms of flavour, sweet and spicy, but very decadent in terms of fat.Cicoria (4/5)The roman dandelions were bitter and lightly tossed in the vinegrette which was a refreshing palate cleanser for the previously two oily starters.Barbabietole (5/5)The dessert of the starters; it was naturally sweet with the stracciatella so lovely.Ammazza Fegato (4/5)Was expecting alot more farro than recieved but the tuscan offal sausage was to die for dipped in the runny yolk so I guess that made up for it.Caponata con Cavolfiore (2.5/5)Just regular cauliflower in butter and little bits of pork here and there with cheese, maybe its just me because I'm not European or well versed in their food culture but it was pretty average for me.Pizelle, Torta Cioccolatino, Amaretti Arancione, and Cantuccino (4/5) We ordered a coffee with the desserts and we were given Expresso Infused Sugar as well as regular sugar and cream. The dessert platter was nice I really loved all of them except the Cantuccino. Each of them had their unique flavour and aromas and complimented each other but the biscotti was just there lol.Overall enjoyed the experience but probably not looking to come back; a must try for bar food itallian style :)",4.0,3.0,201,2017-02-09,43.643923,-79.39984,"Bars , Italian , Breakfast & Brunch"
Bar Buca,"I've been to Bar Buca a few times. And it really does have almost everything you need. Delicious boozy cocktails, crispy deep fried goods, aromatic coffee (highly recommend asking for grated cinnamon on top of all your caffeinated beverages), and unique dishes for main eats. Their service is pretty good, nothing ahhhmazing, but still above average. I love sitting at the bar and watching the chefs carefully create and plate each dish. I love their high ceilings and wall of wine hung high. It's a great place to go with a friend or two, but wouldn't recommend coming here for a full on dinner date unless you wish to share small plates or solely come for the cocktails (my favourite is the one with beets. It's zesty and refreshing!). A little on the pricey side if you're hungry, as it averages about $50 per person on a 7/10 hunger scale.Would go back again though!",4.0,4.0,201,2017-02-06,43.643923,-79.39984,"Bars , Italian , Breakfast & Brunch"
Bar Buca,"For my first brunch in Toronto this year, I decided to try Bar Buca. My friend in Vancouver highly recommended coming here, and after checking out the pictures online, I was sold.We called ahead to ask if there was a line up, since it was a Saturday and just after 12 PM. There was none so off we went! We were immediately seated. The front part of the restaurant has an area where people line up for coffee and baked goods. Inside there are high tables for those who want a sit-down meal. There are also bar seats with a view into the kitchen.Uova Strapazzate ($14): mixed variety farm egg, burrata, truffle, basil. My favourite of the two dishes. The fresh basil complements the egg and burrata perfectly. Comes with some bread to balance it out.Uova Rossa: duck egg yolk, bay scallop, pine nuts, crisp prosciutto, scallion. Also very delicious. Scallops were a bit small, but there were plenty.Nutella buffalo milk latte ($7ish): one of the best coffees I've ever had. So smooth and creamy. For the price point, it better be amazing!The stuffed foccacias looked delicious and filling too, for only $8 or so. I'd be able to eat half of it only. I would get that next time, along with their bombolone (cream-filled donut!).Service was excellent. The servers were always available and those who were not serving us were still eager to help. On two occasions, the waitress overheard us wondering what dish had just been placed on a nearby table, and she proactively came over and explained the dish for us.I hope I get the chance to come back and try their dinner, or their brunch again!",4.0,4.0,201,2016-11-08,43.643923,-79.39984,"Bars , Italian , Breakfast & Brunch"
The Good Son,"Color me impressed when you can make reservations for brunch. Although an asterisk should be denoted as they only serve brunch on Sundays (which I discovered when arriving on a Saturday without a reservation the first time I attempted to come here).That said, I was quite pleased with the experience when I made it in the doors.Damn fine chicken and waffles on their menu grabbed my attention. 3 pieces of chicken (1 thigh, 2 drumsticks if memory serves correct) on 2 pieces of waffle (aka half of a large waffle) with some syrup and a berry compote of sorts in the mix. I could've licked the plate clean it.Everything got good reviews, and from creeping on other tables meals I'll say the breakfast pizza and the Filipino breakfast options both looked quite good while unique.Drink selection was a bit less impressive, including $12 caesars and an unimpressive but adequate tap beer selections. On an atmosphere topic, I'll say that I like how the place has a darkness to the room, as since the ceilings are so tall here is actually keeps the place feeling cozy.

Two visits now (with a many year gap in between), I think the menu is decent, nothing to make me crave a visit back, and the cocktail list is very interesting, but not very balanced in my opinion. The food I have had here was ok. Pizza burnt, things i've eaten before, you get the picture. The best part about this place is their bar and the selection they carry.

The Good Son,"We heard many good reviews about this restaurant so we decided to check it out. I was a huge fan of the decor immediately. The lighting is a bit dim but it definitely sets the mood for a quiet date night.The service was excellent, as our waiter immediately greeted us and took our drink orders. There was two of us and since we weren't that hungry we decided to share a Wood-Oven pizza (proscuitto). Do not underestimate the size of the pizza for the price. It is a very large pizza. The crust was aromatic and just the right amount of dough. The toppings complimented each other well, I mean how can you go wrong with prosciutto and arugula, classic. We didn't end up finishing it, only because we were stuffed! I have walked by here many times and have seen the whole restaurant booked up for events and after dining here, I can see why many people would want to host big events such as birthdays and engagement parties here.

The Good Son,"The Good Son is a great place for a casual dinner. Here are a few things to note as you plan:1. Pizzas. They specialize in pizzas with a drier (not greasy) crust. The Moana Loa is delicious.2. In addition to pizza, they do comfort food such as a jerk shrimp appetizer, steak frites, steak tartare, burgers, salads, etc. This is the place to come with a group when you are not sure how to please everyone. 3. The place has a fun/strange vibe (lots of 100 year old photos all over the walls) that attracts a youthful crowd from Liberty Village and other nearby neighbourhoods.4. The restaurant is loud. If you want an intimate conversation, best try elsewhere. It gets loud in here at dinner.5. Service is very good.

The Good Son,"This is such a hard review to do... I want to give it a 4 star but comparing it to Sabai Sabai, L'Unita, and Gusto 101 (which I gave 4 stars each), The Good Son doesn't quite match up.  It's close but too many small quirks just made it less welcoming and great for me to come back.I booked on opentable and once arriving into the lobby area, the hostess was quick to recognize us and put us at a table.  I really think it was smart of them to have an actual lobby area and another door for the dining area in Canada.  Not only does this block out the bitter cold wind (never felt it once), it actually keeps the dining space a very nice vibe without having standing and waiting people stare at you while enjoying dinner.  This little thing definitely made me hopeful for a great night... small details make the difference between a great 4 star and an amazing 5 star.  The restaurant itself is impressive.  Open and incredibly intricate fun details... the wall of mirrors on one and clocks on the other.  The beautiful chandeliers... the stacks of impressive bottles in the bar area and the open kitchen with the wood burning stove for their pizzas.  Just give yourself a minute to take it all in... it's a great setting for a night out.The atmosphere is buzzing cause the music is just a little loud where you do have to speak over it. It's dark with candles. It would be romantic except for the constant music and louder tables who are trying to have a conversation.   So more of a fun vibe.  The tables along the wall are mostly for 4 + people and if you're a party of two... you're mostly stuck with these odds and ends in the middle where you do get bumped a lot.  We were first given the most awkward table in the place... first table in front of the lobby door and out in the open.  Uh no thanks.  We watched as the hostess tried to give that table to a few other people... each saying no.  Funny thing ... seeing there was many other 2 tops empty in the place.As for the service, this is where the first little misstep starting to happen... our waiter was a bit of a sarcastic jerk.  I'm not sure if he was having an off day or he thinks sarcasm is a great way for ""humourous"" service but it just didn't go over well.  Comparing this to the Michelin Bib Gourmands in Chicago, Gusto or Sabai Sabai in Toronto... this was a definite service gap.  Other places had funny but also welcoming staff.  Half the time we'd actually wonder... did he think he was funny or was he being an ass?  Seeing how he wasn't really smiling with us... I think ass.  Maybe it's cause we didnt order any alcohol... not sure.  Either way, he wasn't welcoming and seeing him laugh and joke around at the bar with his colleagues, it made me realize this was going to be an interesting night.The other misstep was the food... don't get me wrong, some of it tasted very good.  We got the prosciutto pizza, sambal brussels, scallops, and PB gelato.  There was just something amiss with each except for the pizza.  The pizza was freshly made and served quickly... the pizza had a nice leopard spot to it.  It's thin crust and had a lot of prosciutto on top.  It's slightly more expensive than Librettos but it is somewhat close to it.  The brussels was nicely made ... crispy on the outside but still tender to bite through.  The sauce was interesting... though someone did say it was salty.  And when you get the bottom, oh god, VERY salty.  Maybe they just need to do more tossing so it coats the sprouts more and leave the sauce out of the dish.  The scallops was probably the biggest disappointment... it's under the main section for $25.  I would say the cook who did it... did a great job cooking them.  What was disappointing was that it was 2 scallops the size of twoonies and minimal amount of sides.  Maybe going to Sabai Sabai and Gusto skewed my version of main.  Other places didn't have large portions but still enough to be a main.  I think if they put the scallops under apps, it'd be more suitable and forgiving.  Thank god we ordered the sprouts or I'd be starving.  Between the poor service and questionable value of food and some unbalanced flavours, I dont think it was at the same level as some other good fun and hip places in Toronto. It's too bad cause there are some great things here... it's just not consistent or good enough to be a 4 star.",4.0,3.0,129,2017-03-21,43.643447,-79.422665,Canadian (New)
The Good Son,"Came here for brunch over the weekend with a group of 5 friends since other reviews had mentioned the good food. Reservations were made ahead of time and our table was a booth which was nice. A few members of the party were late and we trickled in slowly. From the very beginning we experienced poor customer service. Waiter did not introduce himself nor did he inquire what we wanted to drink. It was like he was giving us attitude and service was just awkward. It felt like he didn't want to serve our table at all. The food was delicious, our party ordered the eggs benny, chicken and waffles, and the french toast. All were delicious. However, the service was lacking.

The Good Son,"My fiance and I came for date night and we made reservations in advance. Overall I would say the experience was good, service was good, but food was just ok. We went in expecting some pretty damn good food, and as you'll see, not consistent enough to get the 4 or above stars. Steak tartar: as many mention, this will blow you away. Definitely one of the bests in the city. They start with a incredibly well seasoned, mixed, and perfectly textured steak tartar mix. On top, there's a raw quail egg, which when mixed with the tartar, gives even better texture and more depth and flavour. The finishing touch that makes this dish awesome is the toast. The toast is done in their wood oven and gives it this smoky flavour that pairs perfectly with the tartar. Jerk shrimp: would skip this. We ordered based on recos and reviews, but it certainly did not live up to our expectations. They come as 3 shrimp on top of a mango salad, we added a 4th for $5 more. Overall the shrimp were not very flavourful. They were wrapped in a potato string covering but they really lacked any sort of seasoning, and should definitely not be called 'jerk'. Either rename or re-season. Bulgogi short ribs with kimchi fried rice: as some mention below, the rice is bomb. Delicious and totally the star of the dish. However, the ribs left much to be desired. They were sliced ribs (not your rack-style) and were way overcooked to the point of dryness. The marinade was nice and balanced between sweet, salty and sticky, but the dryness of the ribs killed the dish.Octopus and fingerling potatoes: we've had lots of octopus in many different places and countries. This was good but could be better. Portion size was amazing, you get a whole tentacle for a good price, but the thicker parts of the tentacle became somewhat tough. The tip of the tentacle was the best, seasoning was good, but again, the thicker parts of the tentacle were less seasoned relative to the amount of meat. Very filling dish though and you definitely get your moneys worth of octopus! We didn't end up getting dessert as we were completely stuffed. Overall dishes were very satisfying, but there was definitely something missing from most of the food that could otherwise make this restaurant a home run.",4.0,3.0,129,2017-03-11,43.643447,-79.422665,Canadian (New)
The Good Son,"The Good Son is one of those restaurants I'd been wanting to try, so when a friend suggested going there for dinner, I jumped at the chance.I don't usually talk about the ambiance at a restaurant, but I have to admit the appearance of The Good Son's interior is pretty impressive (and jaw-dropping, frankly). High walls covered in paintings and an eclectic layout, The Good Son is certainly one of Toronto's more unique-looking eateries.But onto the food. We decided to start with the Steak Tartare (""Soft-Boiled Quail Egg, Grilled Sourdough"") and I have to admit, this was one of the best versions of this venerable dish I've ever had. The meat was mixed with perfect seasonings and flavors, while the tiny quail egg sitting atop the tartare was an ideal accompaniment. Seriously tasty.For my main, I went with the Mauna Loa Pizza (""Smoked Pork Cheek, Compressed Pineapple, Habaneros"") and again, this was delicious. The smoked pork cheek was amazingly addictive, while the other toppings were perfectly utilized and spaced out. (Seriously, this is a problem with a lot of pizzas. The toppings have to be evenly placed!)I was too full for dessert, but I certainly look forward to returning and sampling their sweet wares.",4.0,5.0,129,2017-02-01,43.643447,-79.422665,Canadian (New)

I was hoping for more meat. I then ordered their cod as it was their fish of the day and it was seared nicely. Their fennel salad was dressed lightly and their potatoes crispy.

The Good Son,"Came here last night with a group of 16 for a birthday celebration. We were told we only have an option to do a set menu that was served ""family style"". 7 of us arrived about 50 minutes late (the birthday girl has an indoor cat that got away outside, we had to find it). They skipped our first courses, we had to ask for it to be brought out. They brought us 1 pizza, which was pretty good, but it was to be shared between the 7 of us. The portion sizes were tiny. 2 regular plates of pasta to be shared between 7 people. The server told us he couldn't bring more as he ""already brought all he has for us out."" So my question is, if you see half the table is missing, why did you bring out ""all you had"" to serve? He also had a terrible attitude. In the end he comped the birthday girls meal, which was the least he could do since she literally ate nothing. He got upset with us because we ordered a bottle of wine and rather then asking who should be charged for it and splitting it he slapped it on my friends bill.

For the meal I went with what seems to be one of the more popular item (that's not a pizza that is) the short ribs with kim che rice. Although everything was expertly seasoned and the quail egg on top was perfectly cooked, I must've met that I was slightly disappointed with the cut quality of the short ribs - it was quite a lot and ends and silver skin to deal with.

Cava,"Excellent service while seated at the bar.  I had the Octopus Tiradito appetizer, followed by the oyster mushroom second, and finished it off with the Sabel fish.  The roasted pepper of the appetizer gave the dish a very nice smokey aroma which complimented the octopus quiet well.  The saltiness of the olives also was a nice accent to the octopus which was not over cooked as so often they can be.  The oyster mushroom though I think stole the show and must be tried to be believed.  The mix of earthy and salty flavors from the squash mole combined with fresh flavors from the Chayote really elevate this dish above the rest my meal.  The sabel fish was probably my least favorite, but that doesn't mean it was bad, but I think there are a few missteps in execution.  First, the fish was not seasoned consistently with some bites that were much saltier than others.  For a small portion like they have I feel like it should have been better seasoned.  Secondly and perhaps more importantly, I my collard greens ended up soaking up all the oil and was very greasy.  I think the idea of having some slightly bitter greens to contrast the flavor of the fish is the right one but the execution could have been better.With that said, I still think this is one of the better restaurants in Toronto.  Don't be fool by the yelp price guide though, if you are looking to get full and have a drink with your dinner, your looking at 85 CAD or more/person.",4.0,4.0,127,2017-06-15,43.689561,-79.395044,"Spanish , Tapas/Small Plates"

The meats and fish all seemed to be high quality, and there were some interesting flavour combinations. Interior of the restuarant is nice and service was good, too.  Overall a good evening, but I just don't think the value is there.

Cava,"Not sure from where to start but I have to start from somewhere. I have heard about this place and read a lot of good reviews so decided to go there and check it out. I didn't know what to expect but everything exceeded my expectation  except for one thing, you will know at the end. I was confused what to order and the chef there said he can custom the dishes and make them smaller so I can try different ones which for me was amazing I never had this offer in any other restaurant. They served half portion of the salad, half portion of the octopus and the sardine which is a small portion. I wasn't that hungry but I enjoyed every bite, the salad was amazing the pistachio gave it an amazing taste and crunch. Eventhough it was half size but it was filling. The octopus was perfectly done the combination of the flavours were amazing, the olive the sauce the octopus; very well done. So back to what didn't meet my expectation; if they give you a cookie when tbey bring your check, don't eat it, it will take away all the good flavors that you just ate, put it aside or take it home, for me it didn't taste good.",4.0,5.0,127,2017-09-21,43.689561,-79.395044,"Spanish , Tapas/Small Plates"
Cava,"Cava is outstanding. We were running late for our reservation on a saturday night, and they still kindly sat us 30mins after! Started off with the pincho of gamay-poached foie gras and supergilda. There was so much flavour!! Followed by the ceviche, fried eggplant and smoked pork jowel. The hazelnut spread really added a nice twist to the pork jowel. An intimate spot for a date, very impressed!

We went here on the recommendation of a local friend and it was a wonderful dining experience ... definitely some of the best tapas we've ever had. Lucas, our server, was very helpful as we were unfamiliar with the dishes. He orchestrated our dinner based on our tastes and what was popular at the restaurant. Everything was delicious!

Cava,"Went here for Father's Day as my dad requested a place that had Paella on the menu. The ambiance is very classy and the servers are very professional. We ordered the oyster mushrooms, shrimp ceviche, octopus adobo and the paella. The turnaround time was good with each dish coming right after we completed the previous dish with the exception of the paella (takes a longer time to prepare). For dessert we decided to share the pistachio cake.1) Oyster Mushroom - Very well cooked mushrooms with a delicious garlic sauce.2) Shrimp Ceviche - Good amount of shrimp and good contrast between the seafood flavour and tang from the lime juices.3) Octopus - Extremely tender octopus with an equally delicious potato pancake.4) Paella - Large portion with a variety of proteins including chicken hears, escargots, clams and chorizo. Only aspect I would change is to cut down on the salt levels.5) Pistachio Cake - Moist slice of cake with just the right level of sweetness.Overall, a very good Spanish tapas restaurant and would come back again for another special occassion.",4.0,4.0,127,2016-06-22,43.689561,-79.395044,"Spanish , Tapas/Small Plates"
Cava,"This little Spanish restuarant is tucked inside a small plaza a block north of Yonge/St Clair. The atmosphere is quite intimate.The apps or pinchos were small packets of disinct flavors. The supergilda was a savoury sardine-based pincho that opened your appetite for the upcoming courses. The croqueta of jamon was a bit too creamy for me, but I can see how someone would prefer that.The red fife wheatberry salad tasted fresh, but it was drenched in argan oil, which drowned out the taste of the other vege/fruit components.The sliced jamon or ham was amazing. Definitely get a plate! The ham had a good balance of fat and lean meats and you can just feel the flavour sink into your tongue.The grilled octopus was the winner. It was not chewy nor did it taste fishy. The meat was cooked to a tender state with the smokeness coming out in every bite.Our server recommended an off menu item, the roasted quail. However, there was nothing special about it. Very medicore.Overall, the service was good for a resturant in its price range.

Tasting menu was a joke. Was just served dishes off the normal menu which isn't really how the tasting menu should work. Portions for our large group were laughably small. Did not get the impression this place had ever actually served a large group. Staff's attitude to some group members was less than satisfactory. Food is just so far off the mark I'd say go somewhere else.

Cava,"Cava was so delicious! Is it bad to say my favorite of the night was the Warm Marinated Olives - i really think I am an olive fan after eating these perfectly salty olives. The Halibut Ceviche was really delicious - first time having halibut this way and the fish was cut into thick large chunks which soaked up the lime, cilantro & onion flavours. The corn nuts gave it texture but the pieces are kind of big which could be too much for some people. I liked my cocktail Spanish Steps - full of orange & grapefruit at first, followed by the alcohol aftertaste.The fried Japanese Eggplant was good when hot, didn't really care for the cheese. King Oyster Mushrooms were good; Beets were good but we opted out of the blue cheese. Duck Breast was cooked perfectly and was good on its own or paired with the lentils. The Fries are literally just fries with rosemary when I'd expected the usual patatas bravas with potato cubes in tomato sauce - still good but not very Spanish (although the server and menu clearly states fries so just my own misinterpretation). Overall a very satisfying meal. The restaurant is kind of hidden and seems out of place from the outside ie. a fancy restaurant in the midst of more casual stores. Good for groups of 2!! It can get quite loud inside so you can choose to sit outside which faces the plaza of other stores, not the street.",4.0,4.0,127,2016-09-12,43.689561,-79.395044,"Spanish , Tapas/Small Plates"

Cava,"What a fantastic hidden -- literally, gem!!! After walking back and forth on Yonge someone finally directed me to the little opening where Cava sits amongst some other smaller places. Walking into this restaurant, the smell makes you want to start consuming dishes before you even sit down. The wine list is fantastic and we had a couple of bottles of the Syrah from France -- really really nice!I came with a group of 4 and when being seated we were prompted that the menu was a sharing menu (as it's oh-so-popular now) and that we'd require between 10-12 dishes between us. Sounded absurd until you see just how small some of these are -- actually one bite...Things that really stood out on top of the wine were the filled red peppers; they had so much flavour. I ended up eating the duck dish to myself which was perfectly cooked and you can't go wrong with the churros! The service was a bit slow but at the same time it was nice not to be rushed while we were all catching up.

Lasa by Lamesa,"Decided to go here because I was craving Filipino food plus I wanted to let my friend try this cuisine since she hsd never had it before. The decor was really simple yet romantic and cozy. Everything here is self-serve which is a nice touch from the usual wait staff. We were not disappointed in the price and taste and the portions were big enough to share. It honestly tasted home cooked. Here's a list of what we got:Lumpia shanghai (pork springrolls) - came with 6 rolls and they were fresh and the dipping sauce really pulled together the savoury flavour of the dishCombo meal with pork skewers - amazing flavours! There were 2 skewers and the pork was well done - cooked but not dry, it was still tender and juicy. And everything went to well together. This dish csme with salad, 2 eggs, and garlic rice. I thought the rice was a bit dry for my likingAdobo chicken - came with 4 pieces of chicken. The sauce was a bit salty but it went well with the rice that we had already. The chicken was tender and there was flavour in every bite. I liked the fact that they had pieces of red chilli which gave it a nice kick.Ube flan - thicker than flan consistency but the ube flavour really pulled through. The purple colour really stood out on its own but when it was served with crunchy granola it was really eye popping! The granola gave it a nice crunch which was fun to eat",4.0,5.0,43,2017-12-15,43.68228,-79.423962,Filipino
Lasa by Lamesa,"This restaurant is a new venture of the hip Filipino restaurant Lamesa. Different from the Lamesa, at this spot you would seat yourself and order at the counter. Water and utensils are both self-served. Kind of like Wvrst and Wilbur Mexicana on King Street. The decor inside was  modern with traditional Filipino elements, accented with bold colours. We ordered a Filipino Fried Chicken, a Oxtail Stew and an Eggplant side dish. The food came out pretty quickly. The Fried Chicken was definitely the highlight. The skin was crispy and flavourful, and meat is tender and juicy. One of the best I've ever had! The Oxtail Stew was intended for 2 people. You can tell they removed extra fat on the tail, which was good. It was flavourful but the dish seemed a bit under seasoned. The vegetables in the stew could also be cooked for a bit longer to my taste. Also for $18, the stew doesn't come with any side dishes or even rice, that's kind of surprising. We had to order a side of rice. The grilled eggplant was tasty, but for $7 it's a bit pricy. It's tiny. Overall, I think the flavour was good but the price we pay (especially considering it's self-served and it's not in the downtown core but on St Clair) is a bit too high. We ended up spending $45 after tax for two people. We would be happier if it's around $30 for we got. P.S. we went in on a cold winter day (0 degree), the restaurant was a bit freezing.

Lasa by Lamesa,"A pretty tasty place overall despite my limited experience eating Filipino food. We ordered the grilled chicken, milkfish, crispy pork belly, vegetable spring rolls, with a side of garlic rice. Nearly every dish was served with what seems to be pickled radishes and carrots that had a slightly sweet flavour. The grilled chicken was really flavourful and succulent, glazed with just enough sauce to coat bites of rice when eaten together. The sauce had a slightly spicy aromstic taste with hints of citrus highlights. The milkfish was lightly crispy on the outside although a bit dry on the inside, but was flavourful on it's own with no complex sauces needed. The pork belly skin was the most crispy and hard thing I've ever eaten in my life, a little too much for me even. My teeth felt uneasy as I bit down on the crispy skin side, however the lean and fatty layers below were fine. Near the other end of the slice towards the end of the lean layers, it is as also a little too dry as the entire pork belly piece seemed to be fried in oil. The spring rolls we're crispy, light, and flavourful, it wasn't too oily for something that's entirely deep fried. It came with its own sweet and sour dipping sauce which I used to pair with the pork belly as well given it's dryness. Although the place is partially self serve, where you go to a side table for your own utensils, plates, and other fixins, the staff at the counter in the front where you go to order your food seemed very friendly and enthusiastic.

Lasa by Lamesa,"I came by here for a mini-birthday celebration. It is a nice small restaurant with limited seating (maybe no more than 30 seats in total). You walk-in and order your food off their menu. They have shareable dishes or set meal dishes.I ordered the Siglog Plate - with BBQ Skewers, Garlic Fried Rice topped with two sunny side eggs and a side salad and papaya salad ($12). I also ordered the fresh lumpia ($6) (it is a ube crepe wrapped with vegetables topped with plum sauce).I love Filipino food and this place is on my 'love' list. The garlic rice was nice and crunchy but not too overpowering, the skewers were juicy and marinated to perfection. Sometimes I find the BBQ skewers at other places over burnt or too sweet but this version had a nice balance of sweetness. The salad had a citrus dressing and the papaya salad was sweet and sour at the same time. The fresh lumpia was good but not my favourite. I think I prefer the tradition fried lumpia better. But if you want a nice appetizer on the side that isn't deep fried, the fresh lumpia is the way to go. Think of it as a crepe with ube taste filled with fresh vegetables inside.The atmosphere is super cute in here, clean and simple. You have to get your own utensils and also remember to clean your table off when you are finished. You can also pour yourself some water available at the side of the restaurant.

Lasa by Lamesa,"My first official taste of a Filipino restaurant in Toronto and I will say that Lasa is a great one.  Highly flavourful, well cooked, and very affordable ... what's not to love?This small fast casual place has a cute but sparse dining room.  The flavours here are the opposite ... it delivers bold flavours that makes you want to try more dishes.  It is a counter cafeteria style ordering where they call your name when everything is ready.  The dining area is small... maybe 4 tables of 4 seating and two sets of bar seating.  So I cannot imagine this place during the busy dining hours.  We came early at 5 pm Saturday and all the tables were taken but the bar seating is available.When we first arrived, a friendly and helpful woman greeted us quickly.  We knew we had to get the Lumpia Shanghai and Fresh Lumpia.  Sadly they were all out of the Fresh ones already! With her help, we also ordered the fried chicken, Lasa salad, garlic rice, and a juice.  She mentioned it's enough for the two of us ... let's just say we ended up taking two take out boxes back with us!  A great amount of food for $40!We sat down at a table and noticed it had a tad bit of food left from the previous patrons.  A quick wipe and grabbing a few extra plates and we were ready for our meal.  The great thing was that our order did not take long ... definitely under 10 minutes.  They called our name and the tray was bursting with plates.  We definitely ordered too much.Lumpia Shanghai - fried pipping hot and filled with flavourful pork.  The vinegary fish sauce dipping sauce was a nice contrast to the Lumpia.  The edges were crispy and we got 6 rolls for $6.  Great value ... one slight comment, the central part of the roll wasn't crispy.  Not sure if they didn't fry long enough or lower temperature.  4/5Lasa Salad - lots of good veggies ... avocado, squash, tomato, cashews, daikon, carrot, tofu, and leaves.  I'm a salad eater so I liked this.  The tofu had a very interesting pungent flavour which I didn't  mind.  My dining partner was a little one and she wrinkled her nose ... it's a bit strong and different plus the skin was soggy so it just threw her off.  It is a bit higher priced ($13) but still good. 4/5Fried Chicken - Wow ... loved this.  I have no idea what they put into this but the crackly crispy skin is full on flavour and the chicken was so tender and moist.  I loved adding pieces of this to my salads and made for a great meal.  You get 4 large piping hot thigh pieces.  It is a tiny tad greasy but it's a minor comment to how incredible it tasted and crunched.  4.5/5Garlic rice - for $2 you get a big bowl of it that can feed 2 people easily.  Grab your breath mint cause they were joking on the garlic ... I loved it. The flavour was potently garlicky in a good way and was great to mix in with the fried chicken.I really liked this place ... incredible value for a very filling and flavourful meal.  If they just had the fresh Lumpia available, maybe a touch cleaner, tweaked their fried Lumpia to be crispier... this would be a perfect 5.  That shouldn't take away from the fact it was a great meal and a wonderful introduction to Filipino food for me.  Definitely recommend this place to try and order the chicken for sure!",4.0,4.0,43,2017-06-24,43.68228,-79.423962,Filipino
Lasa by Lamesa,"I don't normally go out for Filipino food because I find that most places are a miss, especially with the different ways we all can sometimes cook our staple dishes, however Lasa really blew me away with the quality in how they prepared our food.I ordered the Silog with the bbq skewers, while my partner ordered the crispy chicken. We added a side of lumpia shanghai, which came at a decent size with a great amount of flavour. The bbq skewers were VERY tasty! They were saucy, and marinated well. The over-easy egg that came with the silog was cooked to filipino-style perfection, as in, the edges were nice and crisp with some browning along the rim - serious skills back there! And it came with a little helping of achara and some salad.The helping was HUGE might I add - so for $12, it was definitely worth it! You feel full after this meal, I will say that.The space in itself is pretty cute and decorative with vibrant colours and eye-catching placements of picture frames, lights and a station for utensils, take out cups, etc. It didn't feel very Filipino-y to me though, as I didn't find much of that heritage reference within the restaurant. Service was friendly, and helpful and I like that you can help yourself to sit wherever you like - not sure if they do reservations, but my guest and I came early in the day for lunch, so maybe that's why we were so lucky to be able to do that freely.",4.0,5.0,43,2017-10-16,43.68228,-79.423962,Filipino
Lasa by Lamesa,"Lasa is one or those places where you order at the counter, eat at a table, and clean up your dishes before you leave. It's a small-ish, cozy place with wooden bowls and self-serving utensils. We ordered garlic rice, fried pork belly, vegetable lumpia, milkfish, and grilled chicken thighs.The garlic rice was basically garlic + rice. It was not something a restaurant commonly offers and so we ordered it. Nothing too special, and if you're a fan of steamed white rice, you're not missing out if you don't get it. Otherwise, give it a try.The skin part of the fried pork belly was way too hard. I'm not sure if it was meant to be like that or if we just had a batch with very tough and crunchy skin. Personally, I found it to be too much. The meat part, however, was very good. Juicy. And the fat that is supposed to be oily in the pork belly was not overly oily.The vegetable lumpia was essentially a vegetable spring rolls. It was ok. Loved the sauce that came with it so much that I ate the fried pork belly with the sauce.The milkfish was alright. It would have been so much better if we were given some sauce with it and if it were more juicy.The grilled chicken was seasoned very well. Loved the tenderness of the meat and the sauce, which had a citric taste to it. Would recommend ordering this.Tl;dr: Overall, it was a nice experience. My criticisms were the overly hard skin of the fried pork belly, and the lack of sauce for the pork belly and milkfish.

Verdict: adobo chicken came with 4 pieces of delicious and well seasoned chicken in a sweet, garlicy and tangy sauce. The fresh lumpia was loaded with crispy veggies and covered in some sort of purple crepe. I am to understand that this was made with purple yam. Whatever it's was, we loved it.

Lasa by Lamesa,"Modern rustic feel, cafeteria style, 3 godlike dishes are how I would describe Lasa in short bursts. Filipino food used to be new to me in the past when it was super unknown to me and now it seems to be all the rage these days in foodie scenes (new Filipino restos popping up and all) I really do believe there is a lot to discover with this type of cuisine and I highly recommend Lasa as a starting point.Lasa is casual but the food really shines. They divide the food in separate categories: fried/vegetables/main etc. We ordered the kare kare with oxtail stew, fresh lumpia, and fried chicken. The kare kare was a first for me, but I've heard many things about it and to me it was  so tasty. It's definitely not for the faint-hearted. It's got this very bold and pungent taste (it has peanut butter in it...I know!), but personally I loved it. The oxtail was super tender, probably braised/cooked for long hours, and everything about it was just powerful. I think it definitely could be one of those you either hate it or love it dishes. Next! Fresh lumpia, almost like a Filipino version of a spring roll minus the protein. The outside was made of ube crepe, which I didn't think would work, but it did! It was sweet but filled with fresh vegetables that somehow had a nice crunch and fantastic flavor to it. Fried chicken was also a winner for me. I have no idea what they flavored the batter with, but this is not like any other fried chicken you will taste. It had its own unique seasoning to it.Honestly, there were so many other dishes I really wanted to try, so I will have to come back!

Lasa by Lamesa,Lasa by Lamesa serves authentic Filipino food. The restaurant has a minimalist design. It seems more like a cafeteria than a restaurant. There's a takeout counter where you order your food. Service is minimal as well. The restaurant is designed for you to serve yourself. The food was quite good. The shrimp curry and spring rolls were my favourite.  The shrimp curry is prepared in a delicate coconut-miso broth which creates the rich flavours. I also enjoyed the bbq pork skewers which I understand is a top-selling menu item. The prices were reasonable.

Lasa by Lamesa,"[23/100]Frankly, when I travel, I am more compelled by natural wonders & architecture. Los Angeles has a diverse food culture that satisfies my curiosity at all times, which results in a low drive to become a traveling foodie. I normally visit a local Trader Joe's and purchase trail mix, fresh fruits, protein bars & water. Food is fuel not indulgence when I travel. Lasa by Lamesa was a rare exception! As soon as I discovered it's existence, I bookmarked it on Yelp, typed it onto my itinerary and followed them on Instagram. Super easy to find, it's located at a building sectioned off into 3 or 4 other businesses. Parking was plenty! There were both residential, street and lot parking. All are metered aside from residential; however, it might be permit only. Watch out for signs, you are not immune to a parking ticket! Aesthetic: Minimal, clean, wooden floors, bright, modern, & patterns. One of the plus is the place is spacious, but limited in seating. There are tables good for groups and bar tables great for one or two people. They have plants on the table which is a great touch. They have a bar table facing the window that leads to the street, great for people watching! Their utensils, condiments, & drinks are self serve. Service/staff: There was a large group on my visit that had the Chef and staff a little flustered but I understand given that they were understaffed. There were two older gentlemen that were very focused on their tasks and may not be use to multitasking. I stood at the registered for a good 3 minutes before the Chef took my order. I placed my order and it didn't take too long and the Chef was very professional. I could tell he was stressed but he did great! Food: I ordered the Lumpiang Sariwa (Fresh Lumpia) with the ube wrapper. It was delicious! I should have order 2 more, to go! The veggies were fresh and cooked well. The sauce wasn't too sweet and there was some on the side, just in case I wanted to drizzle on some more. The wrapper was thick and stood against the veggies! I really like that! And the ube was subtle which I appreciated because ube is mostly used for desserts and not savory. It was filling and that's probably why I didn't order another one. Overall, the only improvement I would advise is staffing. The Chef and staff want to do well and get everything out in a timely matter which is appreciate but the stress is definitely apparent. Other than that, this place is great and they are bringing forth delicious Filipino food!",4.0,4.0,43,2017-02-13,43.68228,-79.423962,Filipino
Lasa by Lamesa,"Lasa by Lamesa is a casual cafeteria-like restaurant. You order at the counter, grab a seat, then wait for your name to be called to pick up your food.Despite being such a casual place, the food here is excellent, and prices are quite reasonable.I highly recommend the ox tail kare kare if you are sharing it with a friend (big portion).

Lasa by Lamesa,Really enjoyed The food here. Nice clean place very bright and friendly staff. I had the Lumpia and chicken adobo as well as pork BBQ. We also had the pancit with chicken.

Lasa by Lamesa,"Good Filipino food with a home-cooked feel. Much more traditional than Lamesa (which is really more re-imagined upscale fusion Filipino food), Lasa offers the typical dishes you'd find if you stopped by and had a family meal in any Filipino home. Our favourites were the silogs (we had the chicken, pork barbeque, fish and tofu versions, all paired with egg, rice and some veggies) which were well cooked, had generous servings and good value for money ($12 for each silog!). The desserts were also interesting - ube flan with pinipig had a nice crunch, while the ice cream scoops were from a local brand (we got the mango flavour - and if you've ever been to the Philippines, you know it has the best mangoes in the world!). Overall, would recommend going to Lasa if you want at taste of the simple and traditional Filipino meal.",4.0,4.0,43,2017-06-24,43.68228,-79.423962,Filipino
Lasa by Lamesa,"I had bookmarked Lasa by Lamesa for a while now but finally tried it out with my hubby. Based on some previous reviews, I was expecting food to be ordered cafeteria style, where you point to prepared foods, but was pleasantly surprised to order at the counter from a menu. The food was ready very quickly so it likely was ready prepared and plated to order. We ordered the fresh lumpia with the anticipation of the fresh ube-flavoured wrapper. This was plated nicely but for me the ube flavour was lost under the peanuts, sweet sauce, fresh vegetables and very cold temperature of the lumpia. I guess I was also looking for the garlicky kick in the sauce that I've come to expect from my family's fresh lumpia sauce but alas this was not my family's fresh lumpia. We ordered the bangus (milkfish) as our protein with the silog (fried garlic rice) combo. The bangus , pork BBQ skewers, and garlic rice were delicious. Eager to try more menu items, we subsequently ordered the lechon kawali, which was at least served warm. The lechon was pretty good, served mostly crispy but some pieces were on the chewy side. Again good, but not the best I've ever had.I like the look and feel of Lasa. Non pretentious, clean, seat yourself kind of place where you grab your own cutlery and wooden plates and plastic glasses. I hope they do well. I would return as I want to try their kare kare, fried chicken, and chicken inasal. 3.5 stars.",4.0,3.0,43,2016-10-29,43.68228,-79.423962,Filipino

This is definitely up there in terms of Filipino restaurants in North America, and I'm happy to support my generation of chefs and restauranteurs.You must eat these... The kare-kare. Slammin'.

The skin is karate kick to your face good, but I thought the meat was a bit underseasoned.Pass on the... Ginataan. Not really what I expected when it comes to squash/pumpkin done Filipino style.

Lasa by Lamesa,The place is well decorated. The food is even more pleasing to the eyes. We ordered couple of dishes to try things out as we are visiting the area. I got excited because they have chicken inasal. Here's my opinion on the food. As the food is presented so well. They look so amazing! Pictures are attached to this review. The Veggie Lumpia is really good and so is the crispy tofu. Fried bangus is hard to mess up since that is fried. And this place fried that bangus right. pork bbq is alright. Now the chicken inasal was disappointing. We all didn't like it. Most of oue kids didn't finish it. It was not the inasal taste I was expecting the marinade doesn't really go well.  I would have given the inasal 2 stars. But other food was fine and would not pull down the rating for one dish.,4.0,4.0,43,2017-11-17,43.68228,-79.423962,Filipino
Stelvio,"I've passed this place quite a few times on my way down Queen West and it always struck me. Superficially it was the decor. I love a place that looks cozy and quaint and Stelvio definitely does.They specialize in Northern Italian cuisine and it's a nice change from the standard run of the mill Italian food that restaurants usually have on their menus. I love the authenticity mixed with high-class dishes and plating. We were seated right away upon arriving, which was great, despite it being a Friday night.We ordered the sciatt (basically fried cheese balls from heaven). It's the perfect appetizer for any deep fried lover. The polenta fritters were perfectly fried, while the cheese had the most amazing melt-factor. I couldn't believe what I was tasting. For my main I ordered the tagliatelle ai funghi porcini and again, absolutely amazing. I love that the pasta is homemade in-house and the ingredients used I could just tell were of the freshest quality. I would definitely recommend this place! Not only is the decor amazing, giving it this cute and cozy vibe but the food exceeds what you'd think. Stelvio isn't just a pretty face on Queen West, the food actually does the talking. This would also be a prime spot for a date night. Next time you're in the mood for Italian food but are tired of the same-y menus everywhere under the sun, hit this place up, you'll be taken on a culinary journey, exploring the Italian north.",4.0,5.0,74,2018-01-04,43.649212,-79.395485,Italian
Stelvio,"I would say first- between a 3-4 star rating. We came for dinner on a Friday night.  We were seated right away and provided our menus.  Our server took a little while to come by, but when he did, he was great detailing the menu and wines.They bring bread and oil and olives to the table to start.  We ordered and shared the Taroz starter ( mashed potatoes mixed with green beans and cheese).  This was a very comforting starter, but lacked a little flavour given the cheese was very light. Still enjoyable.We shared the tagliatelle with Wild Boar (was the special) and the osso buco risotto.The pasta was fine, would have liked a bit more of the sauce.Overall pasta - underwhelming Now- the osso buco .. gimme a moment!!! This mix of risotto and the sauce and meat was DELICIOUS!! It's worth the $29 price! It's a larger serving and we took some home after!  Savoury and rich just blends so nicely .Wine was on the pricey side ..5oz for $19I would return for the osso buco for a special occasion.",4.0,3.0,74,2017-12-23,43.649212,-79.395485,Italian
Stelvio,"I discovered this tiny little Italian restaurant through yelp. On a warm summer day, I imagine it would be lovely to people watch on the patio (the restaurant is situated on a very busy section of Queen st).I tried two dishes - tagliatelle with fresh homemade meat sauce and fried herbs, and the risotto alla milanese with osso buco. I really enjoyed both the dishes- the risotto, in particular, was richly flavourful. The portion size was also very generous, and I packed half of it home for lunch the next day.Would definitely want to come back in the future and try other dishes!",4.0,4.0,74,2017-12-05,43.649212,-79.395485,Italian
Stelvio,"WHAT TO TRY?!Since you most likely tried mainly southern Italian cuisine in the many Italian restaurants you've been to, you might be up to trying a restaurant that specializes in Northern italian cuisine here!! Basically I would recommend all the dishes here because it's a different method of flavouring and cooking style. We tried the sciatt, a buckwheat fritter that had Valtellina Casera DOP cheese inside the balls! Very unique and very tasty especially when it's served hot, the cheese melts inside. We also had the tagliatelle with Ragu Bianco. Homemade tagliatelle with homemade meat sauce. Pasta was al Dante just the way I like it and the pasta had just the right amount of sauce. Not too much and not little. We also ordered from the second section and got the polenta salsiccia e Funghi. The sausages on this polenta tasted so good and I'm a big fan of porcini mushroom too so I liked the bite to this mushroom. The polenta was okay, you really need to eat it with the sausage and the mushroom to add the flavor into each bite of this dish. The waiter was super friendly and nice. She would walk me through the menu and explain what she would recommend us to eat depending on how hungry and how heavy we want the dishes. She would also be brave enough to say if it was too much and asked us to settle for less food to really enjoy the meal. I loved the music they played at this restaurant. They played Italian and it really added to the experience. I thought I was in Italy for a second in my time spent at the restaurant. LAST TIP?You can opt to share dishes because that's what we did so you don't have to just order pasta. You can opt to try the other dishes in the primi and secondi menu too! The restaurant is mainly open for dinners. Only time to catch them for lunch is Friday and Saturday!",4.0,4.0,74,2017-11-10,43.649212,-79.395485,Italian
Stelvio,"Stelvio is an Italian restaurant in Downtown Toronto. It was packed on a Saturday night and we were lucky to have a table. After glancing the menu, we placed our order. Shortly after, our server brought us a plate of Poppyseed Sesame Bread served with EVOO balsamic vinegar dipping sauce and herb marinated olives.Based on other Yelp review, we ordered the Taroz, which consisted of crushed potatoes with green beans, butter, onion and cheese served on a iron skillet. It was to die for. The only other thing to die for was Zuppa D'Orzo Carciofi E Patate, which was a soup with barley, artichoke, potatoes, and garlic.We're weren't too impressed with the Dante Salad, Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini, and Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini. The Dante Salad consisted of shredded pan seared chicken breast, Caesar DOP cheese, lettuce, and red chicory lightly tossed in a dijon vinaigrette. I didn't like how either Tagialette had much flavor or sauce. Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini consisted of fresh homemade tagliatelle pasta with porcini mushrooms. Tagialette Al Ragu Bianco consisted of fresh homemade tagliatelle pasta with homemade meat sauce and fried herbs including sage and rosemary.",4.0,3.0,74,2017-10-13,43.649212,-79.395485,Italian
Stelvio,"This place is critically underrated. I was seriously surprised how few people were here on a Sunday night. What I really appreciate about this place is that the pasta is always made fresh daily! For this reason, I always have the Gnocchi with tomato sauce and basil.

Stelvio,"The hotel concierge had recommended a different Italian restaurant, but I didn't love the look of this. Given the Yelp reviews, I thought Stelvio would be a better choice. It was pretty quiet when I arrived, though some more folks came after. It's a cute little place, though the music choices (Elvis-esque music played a little too loudly) were a bit odd to me, and didn't help with the ambiance. In any case, the food is the thing, and so I ended up with a Montagna salad: arugula, fennel, Guanciale, mint and shaved Grana. It was quite tasty, and the lemon and EVOO dressing was nicely acidic without being too much so.I rarely order pasta as my main because of the carbs, but this seemed like a time to make an exception, and I ordered tagliatelle accompanied by what was described to me as a venison Bolognese. The pasta was cooked nicely, but the problem for me is that it felt like I was eating pasta and ground meat (venison in ground form, at least in this case, was pretty indistinguishable from ground beef) tossed together. Any sauce that had existed hadn't made it onto the plate, and so the dish felt disconnected and lacking for me--I ended up leaving some of it. I was disappointed and wished I'd gotten the rabbit dish I was considering (but I let the waitress talk me out of it).They also served some bread, along with olives, both of which were tasty (and of course a balsamic/EVOO combo for dipping).The other negative--other than my main course--was the wine. I wanted a white, and my only two choices were either $19 or $20. Pretty pricey for a neighborhood restaurant. I got one, but I regretted it, as dinner ended up running $75 with tip and tax. They were very nice and gave me a little glass of Amaro before I left, but while on balance I'd say the meal was OK, it just wasn't worth the price.",4.0,3.0,74,2017-11-06,43.649212,-79.395485,Italian
Stelvio,"Stumbled upon this place while shopping on Queen West, we felt like Italian and hey look! Stelvio is right here! What timing.I loved pretty much everything about this place: the decor, the service, and especially the food. I've eaten at a LOT of Italian restaurants around the GTA and this place really stands above with the dishes on the menu, they are not like the usual offerings you see around here.We tried the tagliatella with meat sauce, the sausage risotto, and started with the smashed potato appetizer (with onions, green beans, cheese and bacon). Literally every one of these dishes was amazing. My only complaint is that food took a while to come out, I found the seats very cramped and a bit uncomfortable by the end of our meal, and it was a lot louder in there than expected (though I blame this mainly on the loud couple next to us).Overall there's no way i'm not going back here for the amazing food and lovely staff (I love the little patio out front too and want to check it out).

Stelvio was an exceptional dining experience from start to finish.From their carpaccio to their fresh handmade tagliatelle, everything we tasted was of excellent flavor, quality, and obvious authenticity. The atmosphere itself is very European - the venue is decidedly small, exhibiting an intimate, yet surprisingly comfortable dining environment. The service was also lovely and swift. Apparently, they have another restaurant in Milan, which is of no surprise - both the menu & execution of dishes would make any true Italian proud.A few Italian beers and delicious hand-rolled pasta makes for a great evening out in the 416.",4.0,4.0,74,2017-05-15,43.649212,-79.395485,Italian

Stelvio,"Came here with a reservation for a table for 4, on a Friday night at 7pm. There was still plenty of room them but filled up quickly but the time we left at 9 it was filled. I love the illustrations and their branding on the placemats and menu, and the cute baseball bench seating across the wall. We started with fritters with DOP cheese, this was quite disappointing barely any cheese and just tasted like fried dough. We also got the polenta toast with porchini and polenta fries, The polenta was soft on the inside and cripsy on the outside, a bit bland but was satisfying. I got the PIZZOCHERI DI TEGLIO, since it was very hyped up on here. The hand cut buck wheat noodles were ok, kinda too chewy and felt a bit gritty, the cabbage was bland but the cheese was good and it was very filling and served in a cute skillet. the TAGLIATELLE AI FUNGHI PORCINI was better, richer and flavourful sauce and good noodles. The RISOTTO ALLA MILANESE CON OSSOBUCO was excellent, the veal shank was tender and the risotto was flavourful (a bit on the salty side) but was savory, the portion was also huge. The food was good but i feel like there are much better places for italian food in the city especially within the same price point. The service was a bit slow between appetizer and entree, it took them a while to bring it out. The atmosphere is lovely though, really cozy and there seems to be other Italians eating there. the place gets really loud when filled but ,it feels like you are in another country by the end of the night.",4.0,3.0,74,2017-09-18,43.649212,-79.395485,Italian

Stelvio,"Come here at 5:25 on a Sunday night, the restaurant was not packed at that moment while some time later it was literally full of guests! The food are overall great, while the speed of serving is a little bit slow, since it is a small scale restaurant , it kinda makes sense. The zucca is absolutely fantastic!! The pumpkin filling is  so sweet and creamy to taste while the outer pasta is not too thick or hard , but offer a considerably suitable accompanying for the general texture! The risotto is gigantic in portion, the meat is so tender and the rice is right in cook, I normally would not like to order a risotto , but it is my type. The meat sauce pasta is great in flavor , the server asked me if i would like to add the tomato sauce into that, I said yes! why not? However, the gnocchi is too soft in texture that is even become marshy in your mouth and the sauce is too salty in my opinion. I would not recommend it for sure.They do offer the free pre-meal bread with the preserved olive and the olive oil with balsamic vinegar to dip. Definitely remember to ask them more vinegar since it is sooooo good! The plate of cured meat with cheese is nice, but the meat might can be more in varieties. The pickled veggies on the side is so much tasty! The salad is just a normal one, which is not that recommend one. The last but not the least, the deep fried buckwheat cheese balls are great, they are crispy outside and gooey inside, you can clearly taste the cheese aroma but not that overwhelming to make you feel sick!

Yasu,"If you want to experience omakase, this is the place you have to go! The restaurant itself is super small and you'll be eating in a very intimate setting (a little less than 20 seats in the restaurant). Seating is either around the bar or on the tables about 2 feet away from the bar. I would definitely go with bar seating for the full experience. Right off the bat you'll be treated by the servers and the sushi chefs and they'll give you their full attention throughout the serving. I was given the option of choosing between the regular omakase and and upgrade to premium sashimi for an extra $25. I figured if I'm spending $110 anyways, an extra $25 couldn't hurt. With the premium upgrade, I was served toro sashimi, uni and scallop. The sashimi and all the seafood that followed was extremely fresh and clean (to taste). It's impossible to expect what seafood you'll be served that night as omakase plates depend on seasonality. However during my visit I had to opportunity to try such nigiris as monk fish liver, stripejack, mackerel, uni, and red shrimp. With each dish the servers or sushi chef will explain the food being presented in front of you, where it came from and how to eat it. We finished the nigiri selection with beautifully sweet tamago and fragrant black sesame ice cream. My favourite for the night was the monkfish liver nigiri, the shiso and ponzu daikon helped cut through the heaviness of the liver. I was also surprised with the shirako as I expected the slimy texture to be off putting but it wasn't and almost dissolved in your mouth. They tell you is ""a part of cod"" without any further description and I wouldn't advise googling which part unless you are truly curious. Overall a great experience and I would definitely come back without hesitation if it were a special occasion. One of a must try's for sushi lovers and a ""have to do try it once"" experience for all foodies.",4.0,5.0,257,2018-01-27,43.662727,-79.403279,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"

Yasu,"WOW. $105/person (+$25 for the premium sashimi plate) seems to be very excessive for sushi but this is MORE than just food...it truly is an experience that comes with it!What is OMAKASE?It's basically a tasting menu of seasonal fish of the sushi chef's choosing that differs every time (which is why they don't have a specific menu). The sushi chef makes the dishes right in front of you and explains the ingredient while serving it.//THE FOOD//~20 sushi pieces/dishes were served, with a small scoop of black sesame ice cream at the very end of the meal. My personal favourite dishes were the monk fish liver, salmon roe with sashimi on seasoned rice, uni sashimi, and the medium fatty salmon sashimi.//THE EXPERIENCE//They only take reservations and make sure you request for the bar seat so you can witness all the sushi making magic! Once you walk in, only 2 servers are present, come early so you get to choose where you sit. There's a sushi master and 2 other sushi chefs that are in charge of making all the food. The meal starts off with the sashimi plate and it's about a 5-10 minute wait for the making of each of the subsequent sushi/dish. Throughout the entire night, I interacted with the sushi master who was serving our corner of the bar seating area. He's very polite and answered all my questions about the fishes he used/inspiration behind some of the dishes! //OVERALL//This place definitely gave me an unforgettable dining experience.

Yasu,"Yasu proves their spot as top Omakase dining experience in Toronto! There is an option of regular ($105/person) or premium ($130/person) for omakase - comes with sashimi, sushi and dessert. The difference is the sashimi served and all else are the same. We decided to go with the premium, and we have no regrets - everything was so fresh and delicious!I love how Yasu takes time to introduce every single piece, making sure you know what you are eating and where the seafood came from. (Service is simply amazing!) I kind of wish I made more notes, but this review would have to go off on my memory. Below are my TOP PICKS for the premium omakase experience (Dec 05, 2017):- SASHIMI PLATTER (premium): My top 3 were the uni from Japan, the scallops and the oyster. You can really taste the freshness and sweetness of the seafood (I'm getting hungry just thinking about it...)- FISH ROE AND UNI DONBURI: This was just unforgettable for me! The uni was very creamy, and it tasted amazing mixed with the rice and fish roe.- MISO SOUP: This was simple yet so bold in flavours, brewed with fish bones- SNOW CRAB WITH CRAB LIVER: The snow crab was so so sweet, and the crab liver was extremely flavourful and not fishy(?). - MACKEREL SUSHI: This was from Iceland and it was wrapped with a thin slice of radish to balance off the taste of the fishFYI - This is a small location so make sure to book a reservation either on yelp or call in! Reservations are opened 1 month in advance of the day you are trying to book for. There is an option of table or bar seat so it's up to your preference. All in all, would I ever come back?

Yasu,"Likely the best sushi and sashimi I've had outside Japan. You must arrive on time and the omakase style menu means you eat what the chef serves. Not for picky eaters, but such a treat to anyone with a love of fresh fish!!",4.0,5.0,257,2018-01-28,43.662727,-79.403279,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Yasu,"Great dining experience at Yasu! The hubby and I came here to celebrate our anniversary and we couldn't be happier with the whole experience.  We sat at the bar (must do) so we got to watch how the sushi chefs fillet and prepared each piece of fish with great details and precision.  Seeing and then tasting it made it a great experience so make sure you don't get stuck sitting at the tables behind the bar. As for the food, it was heavenly delicious. Each piece of sushi has an unique taste with the various garnish like sheiso leaf, daikon, spicy roe, crab liver mousse, Yuzu zest and don't even get me started on the variety of sauces.  We had so many different types of fish that I can't even keep track but what I know is all my previous bad experiences with certain type of fish for example mackerel doesn't apply here. Every thing was uber fresh and didn't have any fishy taste to it.  I would recommend getting the premium Omasake, for $25 more, you will get sea urchin, blue fin tuna, scallop and 2 more premium fish. It's worth it.",4.0,5.0,257,2017-10-10,43.662727,-79.403279,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Yasu,"Location/ServiceA very small restaurant located on Harbord St. Street parking is available and a few parking lots around the neighborhood. Inside is a very simple decor with around 16 seating available. Make sure you try to make your reservation by the bar so you can fully see how the chefs prepare all the sashimi and sushi right in front of your eyes. Service is also good. The waitress and chef were very detailed in explaining each piece. I had to reschedule my reservation and the waitress was quick and accommodating to make the change. FoodAt a fixed price around $105, each meal differs day to day as it's omakase, meaning the chef's selection. For this experience, I get to experience tamago, unagi, black sesame ice cream. And a lot of imported fish such as Nova Scotia lobster, BC sea urchin, Iceland mackerel, Mexico and Japan imported fish (salmon, skipjack, cod, shimaji, scallops, blue fin tuna). For my first experience, I really enjoyed it and can justified its worth the price. Rated as the best restaurant in Canada, Yasu really deserves a 5-Star rating!",4.0,5.0,257,2017-11-08,43.662727,-79.403279,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Yasu,"Yasu is a great spot for birthday, anniversary, or any special occasion celebrations.Reservations: - Reservations open up 1 month in advance, and always always ALWAYS reserve the bar instead of the odd table in the back behind the bar seating.Price: - It's not ridiculously pricy at $105 per person for some really good quality sashimi.- I also recommend getting the sashimi platter at an extra $25. You're already there so might as well!Menu:The menu varies depending on the fish in season but you'll probably always get some of the classics (3 tuna belly slides at various fat levels, sea urchin etc)Staff:There are 3 chefs covering 2 or 3 pairs at the bar. They explain to you where the fish is from and tell you how to eat it. Watching them prepare and cut the slices of fish was really neat. There's free street parking nearby if anyone is looking to drive.",4.0,5.0,257,2017-10-15,43.662727,-79.403279,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Yasu,"WHAT TO TRY?!Omakase!! Whether it be the regular omakase or the premium upgrade of the omakase, they are both delicious!Regular omakase costs $105 pp and the upgrade is an additional $25 pp. The only difference between the regular and the upgrade is the amount of sashimi you get with the upgrade as the first course. Regular would only get you an oyster and scallops whereas a premium omakase will get you an additional sashimi pieces. You get uni from Japan, blue fin tuna slices, lobster sashimi, and stripe jack fish slice. You have to really love fish because the whole omakase is fish from different areas of the world! The experience really takes you around the world with the fish they source from and present before you. Their kitchen is basically what you see when you enter the restaurant! They make everything at the bar. It's really cool to see them make your sushi right before your eyes. Unlike other omakase, it's not about the presentation here. Nothing fancy accompanies the sushi or sashimi slices and you won't see any flowers or fog or great presentation. It's just the freshness of the fish and where they source their fish that makes up the price that you pay. My favorite dish is of course the blue fin tuna. There were three pieces of different sections of the blue fin tuna that was served as three pieces of sushi as one course. I loved every piece of it that I ordered more of it! If you want more sushi, you can order at the end of the meal too. Just to let you know the benchmark you're looking at is $7-9 per sushi if you want more sushi and depending on what sushi you order more of! There is also a wine menu that you can order alcohol to accompany your omakase experience. Ranges from 4 oz of sake to 9 oz of Japanese wine to a full bottle of 300-700 ml. There was one bottle of Japanese wine that was about $1000! You can also do sake pairing ($65) with the set course which is nice! Overall, I thought the chefs were nice to show their knife craftsmanship before our eyes and our particular chef greeted us with a smile. I liked how they kept asking us how our experience was and made us feel very welcomed. And most of all, the dishes came from all over the world. From Boston to Vancouver to Mexico to Iceland to Alaska to New Zealand, I felt like I went fishing around the world and got to taste of the world! LAST TIP?!The restaurant is REALLY small. I really recommend you to make a reservation to sit at the bar because you get to see the knife action before your eyes. Like I said, the kitchen is basically where the three chefs stand at the bar. There are only two tables that surround the outer area of the bar that people can sit at. Either two or four people. You can somewhat see the chef but you won't have a good view of the fish they are slicing or what they are doing behind the bar! So yes, worth the wait to find a spot at the bar!! Premium upgrade is worth it if you love sashimi and want to try out more sashimi from various parts of the world. It is also additional food so if you're up for more, premium is a good option to go. I think I would still order premium set next time I go! Mind you, some of the sushi you order may appear throughout the courses you see with the regular omakase too (except for the lobster sashimi, and the uni sashimi that is from Hokkaido). There's no particular spot where I would sit at the bar that would be better. I guess it depends on which chef you like best if you go here often but it's usually preassigned because there's only 12 seats around the bar for each sitting!!",4.0,5.0,257,2017-11-19,43.662727,-79.403279,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Yasu,This is one fine Japanese restaurant.  The omakase experience is extraordinary and the ingredients can't be more fresh!Sitting at the bar allows you to interact with the chef and see their delicate and skillful techniques while they prepare each piece.  The attention to detail and subtleties add so much to the flavours of each unique piece of sushi.The steady pace of the meal leaves you comfortably full at the end in such a way like it's the healthy pace and portion to eat at.What used to be priced at $80pp was a steal.  At $105 I would call this fair market value.  An optional $25 upgrade for a premium sashimi is fair too and the meal is pleasant whether you opt in or out of that.Probably not an everyday meal sort of destination but certainly a great way to indulge for a special occasion.The only drawback?  You gotta book way ahead to ensure you get a spot!,4.0,5.0,257,2017-10-10,43.662727,-79.403279,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Yasu,"If you always thought tomago (egg sushi) was the worst sushi of them all that's because you haven't had good tomago. Yasu will enlighten your taste buds.

Yasu,"Wow, what an experience. Going to Japan has always been such a dream of mine, so to get a little slice of what it'll be like here on Harbord St? Amazing!It was a 2-hour seating, with around 16 ""dishes"" which include pieces of sushi, some toro and ikura over rice, the most DELICIOUS miso soup I've ever had in my life, and of course, tamago to end the meal. They change it up based on what's in season, but if you're dying to get something they didn't offer as part of the omakase, they'll ask you afterwards if you'd like a little something extra--and chances are they'll have what you're looking for. The service was fantastic and I loved that it was such an intimate experience! The bar only seats 12 (If I remember correctly) and it gave us the chance to converse with the sushi chefs and the other diners and it was just such a nice time. Come here.

Yasu,"I have been to Yasu 4 times and all experience are very impressed!  That's why I come back again and again.  The new sashimi plate for $25 definitely worth the price.  A must add on for the first time visit.  The omakase price increased from 80 to 105 now, but I still believe the price is acceptable especially when compare to quality and service to Zen.  Remember to leave some room for the ice cream.  Just a reminder that extra piece at the end does cost extra $8-10 per piece!Yasu is always my favourite omakase location",4.0,5.0,257,2017-11-18,43.662727,-79.403279,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Yasu,"YASU was my first omakase experience and after hearing great reviews and seeing all the pictures, I had high expectations for both the restaurant and omakase in general. We came in on a Sunday night at the 9:30pm slot with reservations and it was still a full house, so reservations are probably either required or highly recommended (we had reservations). I understand there is a penalty for late cancellations We sat at the bar infront of the 3 sushi chefs, which I highly recommend as you get to watch them prepare your sushi in awe. Our sushi chef appeared to be the lead / head sushi chef and was fantastic. He clearly explained each piece of sushi to us and was kind and smiled to us throughout.We ordered the omakase experience at $105 and added the sashimi special for an extra $25 - pricey.My favourites were the toro (tuna), stripe fish, shrimp, and the sashimi platter (which I think was worth the extra money).Overall, a great and I'd recommend YASU to anyone looking for a premium omakase experience in the city.",4.0,5.0,257,2017-08-21,43.662727,-79.403279,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Yasu,"I picked Yasu for my birthday dinner this year because I heard so many glowing reviews about this place. First things first, the restaurant is small, so be sure to book early (resos open 30 days in advance). I booked maybe 20 days before my birthday and couldn't get a seat at he bar, which is highly recommended. We were seated at a small table by the window, which was nice, but the whole time I was throwing envious glances at the diners at the sushi bar. I feel that sitting at the sushi bar really elevates the whole omakase experience. As for the food, it did not disappoint. I thought the sushi overall was exquisite, and I also appreciated the education throughout dinner (the chef or a server will come explain to you where each fish is from). I paid an extra $25 for the deluxe sashimi plate, which included oyster, sea urchin, and fatty tuna on top of what was offered in the standard set. That's basically everything I love, so I thought it was well worth the extra charge. One area that left me desiring more was the dessert- it was simply black sesame ice cream. For the price paid, I'd like to have seen something a little more creative.But all in all, I had a fantastic experience at Yasu. It's definitely not cheap (but apparently it's pretty well priced for omakase), but the sushi is truly delicious. I would highly recommend for a special occasion.",4.0,5.0,257,2017-10-02,43.662727,-79.403279,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Yasu,"waoooooow this place is amazing. It really set the bar high for any regular sushi place I go to now. Quality of every ingredient really shined through - the rice, the sashimi, the seaweed. Amazing quality. We came in February, and I believe the menu change due to in-season of the ingredients. It was artful and informative about where the ingredients come from. This was my first time trying omakase and it's truly an excellent experience. Everything was top notch - excellent service, excellent atmosphere, food was delicious. We booked at least one month in advance to be able to sit at the bar for 3 people.

Yasu,"Tip 1: Book a month in advance via yelp - make sure you have your credit card. They need it for the reservation. Tip 2: Get a bar seat - the table seats are so NOT worth it. You need to see them in action!Tip 3: Be prepared to try new seafoodI took my husband here for his birthday last night. We were super lucky to get a bar seat where Chef Yasu was serving us. There are 3 sushi chefs, 12 bar seats, and 4 table seats. There's three seating times I believe. We went for 7:15pm and finished around 9:15pm. We ordered the tasting menu for $105 and added an additional sashimi platter per individual for $25 each. It was TOTALLY worth it! We were super full at the end of this dinner, which as a serious surprise.Verdict: Unique foods, thoughtful and detailed chefs, and a wonderful experience.I have been to Japan twice, and many Japanese Omakase tasting menus, including my favourite restaurant in Toronto, Sushi Kaji, and I was prepared to compare it to Yasu.To my surprise, they are pretty different. Yasu has this unique feature where they get specialty fish from all over the world, and some are only in season for a short period of time. It makes me think Chef Yasu hand picks each fish. We tried many unique fishes here. The quality of Yasu and Kaji are on par, both amazingly fresh. Experience is similar, but I do have to say, while Kaji will always hold a special place in my heart, Yasu came out on top (ever so slightly) with it's unique menu. I also want to add that kaji does other dishes like tempura whereas yasu focuses on seafood so it's hard to compare. We had: Sashimi platter: Oyster from BC with a unique Japanese sauce, tuna from japan, bonito (seared fish), amberjack, lobster sashimi, and uni. Very nicely paired with different flavours from all the seafood. Chefs took care arranging each piece. They even grounded up fresh Japanese wasabi in front of us. 9 pieces for $25 Tasting menu: 1. Monkfish liver with fluke fish fin - amazing flavour. I have never had monkfish or fluke before. Google monkfish. They are scary looking!2. Salmon Roe and fatty tuna topping rice - the roe was not too salty, paired nicely with the rice and fatty tuna.3. Fresh live shrimp from BC - only in season for four weeks - Chef Yasu took it out live,  inspected it, and prepared it in front of us. He was so detailed, only putting a drop of soya sauce on it.4. Fluke fish - new for me! Google it!5. Scallop sashimi sushi - very fresh. You can taste each piece of rice and it was not too sweet.6. Firefly squid - the servers came around with ipads showing us this firefly squid in it's natural habitat in Japan. They glow in the dark like fireflies It only lives for one year and it was in season right now. It was very good. He put a miso sauce on it, which made it sweet and flavourful. *one of my fave dishes7. Stripe Jack fish - very unique, a new try for me8. Sakura shrimps - crunchy and flavourful. Never had such tiny fresh shrimps. *another home run9. Fluke fish miso soup - the chef made it in front of us. It was so good!!!10. Three different tunas from Japan - lean, medium, and fatty belly - totally reminded me of Japan. So so so FRESH! I loved how they paired it like this so people can compare the three parts of the tuna! Exactly like how i had it in Japan.11. Ocean Trout from Scotland - I can't tell how this is different from salmon, but it was amazing!12. Mackerel - this was so good. Not too salty and perfectly seasoned.13. Fresh water eel with a sweet Japanese sauce - I didn't even know there was a difference between fresh water and salt water eel! It was fried and served hot. Very good!14. Egg sushi - very soft and sweet. It was almost like a dessert.After this last piece, if you are still hungry, you can add extra pieces. We were super full and didn't need to add anything.15. Dessert: Green tea ice cream with red bean topping - they added a candle for my husband because it was his birthday. *make sure you tell them when they call to confirm your reservation.We got lucky and got to take a photo with Chef Yasu.I really enjoyed Yasu. We paid about $350 with tax and tip. Expect to try different fishes depending on what is in season.

Dundas Park Kitchen,"I finally joined Yelp just to review this place... Stopped by for lunch with a group today and was thoroughly impressed with this great addition to the neighbourhood. We had the breakfast sandwich, roasted chicken sandwich, quiche and a few sides. Everything was incredibly well crafted, with all or mostly-home made ingredients. Far from ordinary and a great alternative to ""convenience"" food like subway...The owners both work in the kitchen and at the front and are exceedingly helpful and friendly. Having a peanut/nut allergy I had lots of questions and they were very careful and accommodating (they do have nuts in the kitchen, though). Baked good looked spectacular!",4.0,5.0,19,2013-07-19,43.652031,-79.447896,Canadian (New)

Dundas Park Kitchen,"An excellent new addition to the neighbourhood! The kitchen offers sandwiches, baked goods and take home. We got a roast chicken with two beautiful sides and two biscuits. Every item was just right, but the chicken especially was epic with salty, crispy, lemony goodness. Decent price too- how often do you get a top-notch dinner for two, with leftovers, for $25 taxes in? The hours are a bit tricky because they close at 7 pm and aren't open on weekends but it's good for stopping by after work to grab something on the way home. Definitely check these guys out.",4.0,5.0,19,2013-06-27,43.652031,-79.447896,Canadian (New)

Aviv Restaurant,"Wow. This is the stuff.  This is the hidden gem of an area that is rather lack luster.  Aviv is hidden away in a somewhat regrettably run-down area near Casa Loma, making it a convenient choice for lunch/dinner before or after trekking through the historical site. At first glance, I wasn't so sure about the quality of food and service when my party parked because even the outside of Aviv remains somewhat unkept.  However, lo and behold you're transported to a funky and somewhat high class dining landscape when you pass through the thick velvet curtains at the front. The service here was phenomenal.  Various servers checked up on us on a regular basis, and one of them included a gentleman that I presume is the owner - that's true devotion to keeping it real with the customer experience. Food-wise, the portions were just right for a hungry hippo and my party was unanimously positive with the flavour of our dishes. I ordered the burger, the cheaper main dish on the dinner menu.  The burger was juicy and satisfying, even without any additional condiments.  It wasn't a crazy concoction like what you would get from Burger's Priest, but it was a burger that you just couldn't disagree with. Also, the cooks were very generous with the fries that came with the burger as a side.  There were almost as many as what you would get in a bag of fries from Five Guys, and that's saying a lot!  They weren't those soggy fries that sit in the kitchen either. They were salty and crisp, just like how I like them to be.  If I didn't have to go to Casa Loma right afterwards, I would have taken my fries to go instead of feeding them to the restaurant's green bin. The salt is real here!Long story short, I definitely recommend you to go to Aviv if you're in the area. It's perfect for friends, dates, and family gatherings. You're never going to be short-changed by the service and food, even if it's not in the best type of neighborhood.",4.0,4.0,65,2017-10-30,43.674554,-79.408984,Mediterranean
Aviv Restaurant,"Went for winterlicious, and remembered that this place caters to the Annex which I'd a mix of student and long time residents. That's the type of place this seems to be. What really appealed to me was that based on the menu it looked like Mediterranean fusion of flavours with lots of fresh and very flavourful ingredients. In terms of winterlicious it was the cheapest option. The atmosphere was fine. Not a basement per se but a nice spot just off Dupont and Spadina. Lots of street parking. The inside seemed a little confusing, didn't know if it was an old school British pub style or bistro. I'll lean towards the former but really was looking forward to the food.Tried the Lamb Meatballs and Mussels as appetizer. Both fresh with nice flavours in a good quantity size. Definitely filling for sure. Main were Jerk Pork Tenderloin and Yogurt marinated Chicken kebob. Both were just okay. I tried really hard to like the pork but it was a little dry, and the sweet potato mash and kale were nothing special. One thing that surprised me was the mango sauce. Didn't go perfectly but was an interesting twist. The kebob was very middle of the road. Pretty much the same thing you can get at any shawarma or Greek fast food place. There wasn't a tzatziki sauce it was literally just plain yogurt. Dessert was very meh as well both the cheesecake and banana bread pudding. Not all bad though. Found out that they do BYOB wine Tuesday and Wednesday and on Monday all wine is half price which if you're looking for a place to drink a lot of wine this is good. Overall, tried really hard to get excited and like this place based on the menu but it fell short of expectations which may have been higher than they needed to be. A 3.0 out of 5.0 right on the nose all things considered.",4.0,3.0,65,2017-02-09,43.674554,-79.408984,Mediterranean
Aviv Restaurant,"Loved the service. Our server was really accommodating and super cheerful. We ordered the veggie mezza platter with a range of standards (hummus, tahini, tabbouleh) and some special ones (butternut squash). I loved the butternut squash and the eggplant. The baba wasn't super smokey, which is great for me. This platter was yummy overall, but was super pricey and expensive imo - $18, but the plate was on the smaller side. More like a standard serving plate, when I was expecting more on a bigger plate.Also got the Moroccan Lamb & Beef Kefta Meatballs. There were 3. The shakshuka (tomato based) sauce went very well with the meat, although the meatballs themselves were on the dry side. That I think made it fall between the fair and pricey range for $10. This is also where I loved our server btw - I had really wanted to get the kefta as a sandwich, but that was only available during lunch (we arrived at 4pm), so she gave us some extra homemade pita bread on the side so I could DIY my own. Points!Really good homemade pita flat bread btw - a warm, homey smell with a nice crunch on the outside and doughy inside.Overall, I'd come back again, but maybe during lunch time proper since the food I like and would get is cheaper during that period.",4.0,4.0,65,2016-12-30,43.674554,-79.408984,Mediterranean
Aviv Restaurant,"Met up with some friends I haven't seen in forever at Aviv for Stop 2 of my Winterlicious adventures. It was very busy! We only waited a few minutes before we were seated by the owner. He was serving, clearing tables and greeting people; he was on top of things! He apologized for the wait even though there wasn't really one long enough to complain about. He had a good sense of humour about it and laughed at my jokes, so he was already winning in my books! ;) We ordered drinks and made our selections. Yay for appetizers; we were starving! The Risotto Balls were fabulous. Smoked tomato sauce smothered over Italian arborio rice stuffed with buffalo mozzarella and wild mushrooms and drizzled with basil pesto. Doesn't that sound heavenly?? It was!  I've had Gnocchi a thousand times. I love it. This was unexpected! It's called Housemade Potato Gnocchi, but it was more like little fluffy clouds with a smooth texture, almost like melted cheese covered in a savoury tomato cream sauce. I didn't want to share even one bite with my friends. Traditionally, potato gnocchi are denser, but these were very light; the portion was the perfect size. I love that Winterlicious comes with dessert, so I don't have to feel guilty about having it. :D On with the theme, I had the Light & Fluffy Lemon Cheesecake. I didn't taste any lemon, but the cheesecake was indeed light and fluffy. The blueberry compote stole the show. It was a great finish to a savoury meal and not too sweet. The service was really stellar. The owner and our server were warm and funny. Both taking a few minutes to chat like we went there all the time. I really liked the atmosphere and their regular menu looks good. I'll have to come back! That's what Winterlicious is for!!

Aviv Restaurant,"Food 4.5/5Service 5/5Decor 3/5We were looking for a restaurant that offered ceviche, so we decided to visit Aviv during Summerlicious. Located near Dupont Station, the restaurant isn't too seemly in appearance, but the employees/owners are so kind. Since it was Monday evening, there was only one other table at the restaurant, so they were prompt and attentive throughout our meal.From the $28 fixed dinner menu, I ordered1 | Cape Cove MusselsWhite wine, shallots, garlic, tomato, fresh herbs, chirizo sausage, house-made cornbread2 | Roast Brome Lake Duck BreastRubbed in ground fennel with a fresh mango, turmeric, sumac & lime sauce, served with sweet potato mash, sautéed garlic kale & asparagus 3 | Lemon Pound CakeI loved my meal. Everything tasted fantastic, and I was quite satisfied at the end.My boyfriend got1 | Thai Tilapia CevicheFresh ginger, chilli pepper, lime, grapefruit, avocado, coconut milk, tamarind, cashews & crispy shallots2 | Pan Seared Ontario Rainbow TroutCherry tomato puttanesca sauce with anchovies, capers, black olives, sun-dried tomato, orange & fresh basil, served with soft creamy polenta, sautéed green beans & roasted peppers3 | Roasted Banana & Creamy Caramel Rice PuddingThe ceviche's flavours had a strong Asian influence, and I would love to be able to recreate that at home. The trout was great as well. The rice pudding wasn't our favourite, mostly due to the unique texture of crunchy rice with mushy pudding. I like that they had a bit more selection to their Summerlicious menu compared to other restaurants, with five different appetizer and entree selections. The only thing I would complain about is that they served dessert before we were even done our entrees, causing me to feel a bit rushed.

Aviv Restaurant,"Had never heard of this place prior to booking it during Winterlicious for my birthday dinner with my family. I wasn't quite sure what this place was when I entered, I knew it was described as Mediterranean but that's sort of a broad descriptor when that may include, Middle Easter, Greek, and any number of other cuisines.I'm still not sure but if I had to wager I guess I might say Israeli-Middle Eastern? At any rate the reviews seemed good and I was open to pretty much anything if it was a birthday treat.The Winterlicious menu was $25/person and included the standard 3 course offering - Appetizer, Main, dessert.I won't go into all the details of what we all had but true to form this restaurant subscribed to the Winterlicious formula of discounted prices meaning severely discounted portion sizes. The rib option that my brother ordered was 4 very tiny ribs and the big push here from the server was the sweet potato fries that accompanied it, she mentioned they was amazing. The dish arrived with 4 ribs and regular fries. There wasn't even a courtesy ""Oh I'm sorry to let you know we are out of_______"" before hand, just food arrived and put down like we wouldn't notice. my brother asked and was given a flippant - ""Yes we're out of those"". No apology, no concessions made... just basically, here are fries.My meal was OK. To start I had the beef carpaccio appetizer which was two very thin slices on a plate, ok, but an amuse bouche at best... not a appetizer. I had the chicken kebab on rice. Which came with a 1/4 piece of pita. Really a quarter of a piece? Are you saving that much money on the bread? The chicken however made up for it in how plump and juicy each piece was and in how it was seasoned. To end I had the flourless chocolate cake, which was similar to a two bite brownie which I enjoyed. What made me mad here was again they skimped on things that were silly. Each of us had a dessert and each was a total disappointment. My parents each had the fruit crumble dessert and one of them got a small portion and the other got 1/4 of what the other got. Anyone who had tiramisu looked like the received half of a small triangle piece - imagine if someone grabbed a fork and took the entire tip off your triangle slice of cake - yeah that.I went in trying to make this a 4 star but the substitutions without notice, the cut corners in random places. They get full marks on taste but lose the rest on value for money and staff.I'd be willing to return and try them out again at full price to see if they're as ""portion conscious"" as they were during Winterlicious, but that won't be for awhile again.",4.0,3.0,65,2016-02-16,43.674554,-79.408984,Mediterranean

The dessert, I wasn't a fan of mine, apple strudel with ice cream.  I guess that's because my mom would make the best apple strudel.  But it was dessert, so I did eat it (a little more than half of it).  My co-workers had a blueberry cheesecake and a banana bread pudding which they book took to go and we tried it back in the office.  Very good!

The tapas platter was fine, but pretty much everything tasted bought (rather than prepared in-house). The waitress messed up our check 3 times.

The Queen And Beaver Public House,"""Sure, Ivan. We can meet at the Queen and Beaver for lunch today"". I said thinking it was probably like one of the firkins. It is definitely not one of the firkins!Classy Victorian atmosphere with some authentic pub charm. I actually felt great just walking in. Ended up going straight upstairs to a wonderful couch and chair seating balanced perfectly between home comfort and out in public wearing a suit and tie. The servers were all very 5 star restaurant professional and warm at the same time. And it is one of those great places where you can show up in a suit and tie or jeans and a t-shirt and feel right at home. Oh and they love their football (soccer for the North Americans) so just fantastic all around. I had the lamb curry and my friend had the daily quiche and a pheasant and ham open face sandwich. Everything looked great and the curry was spicy and excellent. I was very happy that it had no dairy and the server was very careful to make sure it did not. I finished the entire large portion. And my friend happily finished off both of his smaller dishes (which were not so small after all). Price wise it is above a pub and below a classy sit down. My curry was $20.   I enjoyed the Queen and Beaver experience very much and will definitely keep it on file for business or casual lunches or dinners in the future and you should too!",4.0,4.0,319,2017-12-06,43.657443,-79.383357,"Pubs , British"
The Queen And Beaver Public House,"I'm torn about the rating I've given this restaurant. The service was great and the restaurant had a coolness to it with the use of Brittanic kitsch decor. We were attracted to the restaurant after seeing sardines on the online menu. We figured that anyone who serves sardines is ballsy and deserves to be explored. Alas, no sardines were on the menu when we came.Hence the rating conundrum. If you like British cuisine (someone called it ""pub food""), then this is the place for you...and you'd probably give the place five stars. Although the specials sounded fantastic (a veal chop is one I remember), we opted for menu items that we wouldn't find at a typical everyday chop house- pork cheek with white beans and the sweet bread (can't remember the other things that we ordered). Not sure what happened to the white beans but we don't remember them on our plate.So, if British food is your thing, check this place out.",4.0,3.0,319,2017-11-25,43.657443,-79.383357,"Pubs , British"
The Queen And Beaver Public House,"Solid British-style pub with two levels - a more formal dining room on the first floor and far more casual, London-like pub on the second. Like true British pubs, this place isn't solely about the booze - although it does have a good selection of local craft brews. It also has a good offering of solid food that rotates from time to time. For me, a Scotch egg was exactly like I'd had in London, while an entrée of crusted salmon was filling and satisfying.Service at the bar was fairly helpful too, and the overall atmosphere and accessibility of the second floor compared to the ground floor was like day and night.

Just before deciding to go somewhere else, the host offered to save us a table and put our names down. I was really impressed with the service overall here and totally appreciated the host being able to accommodate us. The food was especially delicious! I definitely recommend the duck leg with croquette and curry sauce. Such a satisfying dish... the croquette was nice and crispy on the outside, the curry sauce complemented the duck nicely, and the meat was tender and I could pull it right off the bone. For dessert, I chose to try their homemade salted caramel ice cream. It was the perfect finish to a lovely meal. Thank you so much for accommodating us! An absolutely wonderful meal.

The Queen And Beaver Public House,"I love this place. I was recently in Toronto for the second time and couldn't wait to come back to the upstairs bar. The atmosphere is so comfortable and very relaxing which I enjoy compared to the rest of downtown. It's a British-style pub and that's very obvious with the decor, menu, and even the staff. The bartenders are extremely friendly and happy to have a conversation and to answer any question you might have about the menu. This time around, I enjoyed a Pimms Cup (very refreshing) and a lager (also refreshing). I asked the bartender what would be the better choice between the Fish and Chips and the Shepard's pie and he told me the Fish and Chips were the best you could have outside of England. I wasn't going to say no to that. He was absolutely right. Would highly recommend this dish if you're considering. We came back a second time to the upstairs lounge and decided to try the Hamburgers (they don't serve the full menu upstairs until after 5 I believe). While I enjoyed the Fish and Chips more, this was also an excellent choice. The fries were delicious too. I can't say enough about this place and if you find yourself on this side of downtown, I'd highly recommend stopping by.",4.0,5.0,319,2017-09-18,43.657443,-79.383357,"Pubs , British"
The Queen And Beaver Public House,"This place has been on my list for a few years now - yes, you read right - a few years. A colleague of mine had described it as 'one of the best english pubs in the city'.We went at about 6 pm on a Sunday and we're seated right away at a nice table. The waiter was extremely polite and helpful and the service was excellent! The order: I got the roast dinner which had the roast cooked perfectly, so tender and well seasoned. It came with a delicious Yorkshire pudding, roasted veggies (green beans, carrots, beats, parsnips and potatoes) all doused in a delicious gravy ($28). My wife had the fish and chips - it was one large piece of haddock with a bowl of chips that were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The haddock was well seasoned and had a really nice crunch to the batter. It came with tartar sauce and a really interesting and fun tasting house ketchup with caraway seeds. There was the Heinz ketchup and malt vinegar as well. ($19)The mains were both DELICIOUS and I don't think I could pick a favourite. We were just about to leave when I remembered some other Yelpers talking about the sticky toffee pudding. Oooooooh yes yes yes yes. It was so rich and warm paired with a scoop of in house made ice cream. Oh god it was good. We shared this - I recommended sharing this one as it is quite rich. They didn't have Guinness but offered a junction brewery stout that my wife said tasted like Guinness with espresso (in a good way). Overall.... great service with an excellent meal.

The Queen And Beaver Public House,"This is such a gem in the heart of downtown. The Queen and Beaver is a genuine replica of a proper classic British pub, not a watered-down franchised attempt at it.So believe me when I say that this isn't your typical bar with cheap booze and bad food.Located on Elm St. (a side street just north east of Bay and Dundas), this pub offer small cozy rooms, a front patio and an upper level patio.This is high end food so it will cost you a bit - but it will be worth it.I think the management made a very good choice in breaking down the menu based on the time of the day you visit.The menu changes throughout the day: you will have a brunch, hors d'oeuvres, lunch and supper menu. Also, I really love the idea that each menu, has few options you can choose from that will help you to select what you want to eat within minutes.Wherever there's a short menu I have noticed in all my experiences eating out, that the food is not only fresher, but it's also faster for the chef to cook and to be served (depending how busy a place is) and allows the restaurant to changes some of the items throughout the seasons making each of your visit more interesting because you can expect to find different dishes from time to timeSome of the items though, are a classic and they always be in the menu because it would be almost a crime if you won't have being a pub. I'm talking about dishes like fish and chips or Shepherd's pie. Well my friends, for the old fav pub fare, these items will never change and will be always there.My last visit here, we had their fish and chips, grilled feather steak & tewkesbury mustard, 2 lbs of PEI Mussels steamed in wheat beer, fennel & cream and scotch eggs. All the food came at the same time, within 20 mins from ordering. It was well cooked and of good portions.The drinks? Well, the selection is very good even thought I would like to see more of a 50/50 distribution of choices: a bit more classic English/Scottish beer (like Fuller's, Spitfire, Courage best bitter, Belhaven, or even McEwan's). While the local selection is very good, I think I would remove from the menu the following beers not because they are not good (actually they are), but because they are not local or British (the Queen and Beaver is a British pub in Toronto!):- McAuslan Brewery (Montreal, Quebec)- Sierra Navada, California, USAIn each visit, I found the service to be very good: people working here are very nice, attentive and make you feel comfortable. You can even crack a joke and they will ""follow"" you. Like I said in the opening of the review, The Queen and Beaver is cozy, beautiful pub centrally located that offers an authentic great English pub fare along with a great selection of drinks handled by a capable staff. This is a great spot for a few drinks when you want an intimate atmosphere; or one of those place where you can come for a drink alone with a book, with an old friend for a good chat or even with a group of people.

Not wanting to be rushed, I chose to venture upstairs instead and I'm so glad I did!  The second floor is more relaxed with a first come first serve policy, couches and an outdoor patio. It's a great space, almost like someone's attic transformed into a large living room with a friendly bartender. We spent several hours there, having drinks, moving to dinner, watching the game and catching up. Our waitress was excellent, getting the feel of the group and largely leaving us alone to our own devices. I had the Bangers and Mash which was hearty and well seasoned.

My favourite part was by far the batter: the lightness of the batter just made me crave for more batter on the fish, which is unheard of. It was just that good! The large piece of fish came with a side of chips, lightly seasoned with salt as well as a homemade ketchup and a homemade tartare sauce (once again, amazing and not heavy at all).Prices for cocktails are slightly above average, ranging between $10 and $15, beers as well.

The Queen And Beaver Public House,"This is a cosy English style pub located in the heart of toronto.

This place has two floors, and they have a patio upstairs as well, however, it was packed on the night we visited so we seated at the patio downstairs.Staffs were friendly, but a little slow on service, we didn't get the menu after 15 mins we were seated, but I guess they didn't expect it would be busy on a Wednesday night as well. After going over the menu, my friend decided to get their haddock and chips, a well known traditional food in United Kingdom. And I had my mind set on the salmon and watercress pesto wellington. After around 30-40 mins, our food finally arrived! (Thank god we had beer  while the wait) The haddock was beautifully done, crispy outside juicy inside. Loved their fries on the side as well.

The Queen And Beaver Public House,"I came to the Queen and Beaver for a late Saturday lunch, right after arriving to Toronto by bus. My husband and I were starving and the restaurant was only offering its pub menu at the time, but we thought the choices would be adequate. After reading other Yelp reviews ahead of time, we first went upstairs to sit, but it was very busy, so we decided to go back downstairs to sit. We sat at the downstairs bar, which was empty besides the servers and us at the time. Personally, I found the quieter downstairs area much nicer than upstairs. The servers were also very pleasant. I had the mushroom pithivier, which came out looking like a slice of cake with some salad. The pithivier consisted of lots of layers of thinly sliced potato, a layer of mushroom and some melted cheese, and a layer of puff pastry. It was tasty, but overpriced at $22. My husband's full-size mussels dish was $21 in comparison, which seemed much more reasonable. It was very odd my vegetarian dish cost more than his did, especially when he had seafood, which can be a little pricey. I gobbled up the pithivier and salad greens in no time, and helped myself to some of the fries that also came with my husband's order. Maybe other dishes are more fairly priced, but the pithivier was the only meatless option that wasn't an appetizer/snack. As charming as the atmosphere was, we were underwhelmed by our first Toronto meal, and left feeling like we'd overpaid.",4.0,3.0,319,2017-03-22,43.657443,-79.383357,"Pubs , British"

Lee Chen Asian Bistro,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here on a Monday night during out trip to Toronto. I was overall very content with the the ambience, the food, and friendly staff.The restaurant is located below ground level, so we probably would have just passed by it had we not been looking for it. Upon entering, I was surprised to see just how large and spacious it is with very simple, but tasteful, decor. The clean and relaxing environment made it very easy for us to get comfortable as soon as we were seated. We both started with a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. Unfortunately, the drink menu was quite limited with only wine and beer, but luckily, I was very content with the wine I choseIn regards to food, we selected the Soup Filled Pork Dumplings, Pan Fried Pork, Shrimp and Garlic Chive Dumplings, and Sparerib Bites in Rice Powder for appetizers. For our entree we chose the Thai Green Curry Chicken to share.Both the dumplings were FANTASTIC, and the Thai Green Curry was just as good! Between these three dishes, I couldn't decide which I liked the best! The one dish that was a huge disappointment was the Sparerib Bites. We were served a heaping bowl full of bites that looked quite tasty, but after we both consumed the first one, we quickly changed our minds. First of all, they were bone in! In my opinion, a ""bite size"" item that you can just pop in your mouth shouldn't be bone in! If they are going to be, it would have been helpful if it was indicated on the menu. Sadly, it was not. In addition to that, the flavor was really lacking. We were excited to try this unique dish, but it turned out to be our least favorite of the night. We were quick to agree that we wish we hadn't ordered them, and had gotten another side of dumplings instead.All in all, I would still recommend this spot to anyone craving some hot and spicy Asian food. My suggestions: dumplings are a must to start off the meal, and if you are to get the delicious Green Curry, make sure you order a side of rice to help soak in every last spoonful of the curry (the entree does not come with rice). With these appetizers, this entree, and the great setting, you are sure to have a fun and relaxing experience, with some delicious food!",4.0,4.0,66,2017-09-10,43.647369,-79.386763,"Dim Sum , Asian Fusion"
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,"I have been looking for a dumpling restaurant downtown Toronto for a while and after trying out this place... I'm still looking. Dumplings were not as expected- too much dough around and the filling was not as good as elsewhere. I would rate their dumplings 2 stars only. However I really liked the greens here and the atmosphere is really nice, as well. I would come back to try their curries and different greens but not the dumplings. I still think that Ding Tai Fung dumplings are the best I have tried so far.",4.0,3.0,66,2017-11-19,43.647369,-79.386763,"Dim Sum , Asian Fusion"
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,"On a cold winter day, my friends and I came here to enjoy some delicious dumplings. I always seem to past by this place but have never been here until now so I was quite excited to try this place. We came here around noon for lunch and it wasn't too busy when we arrived. Located on King Street and known for their lunch specials, it does get quite busy here despite being a fairly large restaurant with plenty of seating. My friends and I ordered a bunch of both fried and steamed dumplings ranging from $6.99 to $7.99 you get about 6-8 dumplings with each order which is a pretty good deal. Our order came out pretty quickly. We ordered the soup dumplings, steamed vegetable dumpling, fried pork dumpling, fried pork and shrimp dumpling and the green onion pancake. Dishes were great. I especially loved the soup dumplings- nice size and very flavourful. The fried dumplings were cooked very nicely. You can't go wrong with the classic fried pork dumplings. However, the steamed vegetable dumplings didn't taste great at all. I've had better vegetable. Service was good and staff were friendly. Overall, a pretty good place to get dumplings and other Asian dishes. Prices are pretty reasonable.

Lee Chen Asian Bistro,"This fusion restaurant was really easy to get to from my friend's apartment downtown. We came after a night out during pride for some dim sum, and a little bit of a wake me up. We split a bottle of the of the sake between four of us, and the server would fill a little carafe with the sake, bring it to be heated and then bring it back to our table for us to consume! They were very quick (though it might've been because it wasn't super busy when we were there). All the food we ordered was pretty tasty, although next time I probably wouldn't order a rice based dish. The pork belly was delicious and wish that we had ordered another plate.

Lee Chen Asian Bistro,"Came here on a busy Saturday night. They seated us right away and we got a little booth. The menu is expansive so you really have a ton of choices to suit your tastes at the time. I went with the pork belly bao to start followed by the pan fried pork dumplings. A double dosage of pork, I know, but it was worth the health splurge. The pork belly bao was better than I've had anywhere else. I liked being able to put it together and add as much sauce as I'd like. The dumplings following were also delicious. I wouldn't call them the best dumplings I've ever had but they still got the job done. My friend got a similar mix for their meal and they agreed that the pork belly bao was the best. This place seats a lot of people so it was quite busy and from the time we sat down, there were multiple people that came in and out. The food came out really quickly but I didn't feel rushed to leave which I appreciated. The restaurant was very clean and the service was great.

There was no wait when we got here but the restaurant seems busy with 5-6 table left.The waitress here are very nice and attentive to our needs. The food was good. But I still like dim sum from LA better. We order Xiu Mai, pork dumplings, wonton soup, and pork buns. The xiu mai and pork dumplings tasted very generic just like every other places I've tried. Their wonton soup was just okay. A little bit flavorless, however the pork buns was extraordinary ... they gave us a dish filled with veggies, sauce and pork and a separate plate of buns. You wrap the buns in the spot. Overall good quality was better than average but it wasn't exceptional.",4.0,4.0,66,2017-02-07,43.647369,-79.386763,"Dim Sum , Asian Fusion"
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,"Step into this restaurant on a busy weekday for lunch and you are instantly transformed.   It's on the lower level along King Street and away from the noise. We did not have a reservation. There is a small sign along the street in case you get lost as this restaurant is abit hidden. I have never had my order brought to me so quickly. I had lunch with a co-worker around 13:00pm on a Thursday afternoon. It took about 5-7 minutes before flavourful steaming food came out. I ordered the Kung Pao. Presentation was definitely fusion based hence the theme of  this restaurant. On a white square plate were a large single spring roll, steamed white rice, a small salad and a bowl of sweet and sour spiced chicken. The rice was served in a cute little brown bamboo weaved basket that also had a cover. I noticed that the salad had about three pieces of boiled eggs on top. I did not appreciate that. It's either you put an entire egg or you don't. It seemed odd as it was just three tiny pieces. The salad was iceberg lettuce tossed in a delicious sauce. The flavours I cannot decipher but it reminded me of a Thai peanut sauce despite the white colour. I enjoyed the spring roll. It was steaming hot. Golden and crispy it was stuffed with vegetables such as carrots. I paired this with the packets of plump sauce that was available on the table. The spicy chicken was presented in a rice paper bowl that was edible. It was about 1 1/2 cup of vegetables and chicken in the bowl. The steams made me want to dive in without regard for the hot temperature of the dish. The bowl was crispy on the top. I could not resist breaking a piece off to taste it. The chicken was tender but not spicy at all. It was accompanied with red and green bell peppers that were cut to the same size and white onions. I found a large piece of onion with a piece of the head attached. The vegetables and chicken were steeping in flavourful juices and topped with roasted cashews. They were unsalted. In the end, the bowl sucks up the juices and makes eating the bowl delicious. The star of this dish were the four dried red chillies. I obviously ate all four. Again not spicy at all. Chopsticks were too large. However, they provide a fork in case you can't use them well (quite handy on their part if you ask me). Dressings on the table were the standard soy sauce and chilli oil. I tried the chilli oil on its own and it was not the least bit spicy. I like spicy so I may be bias here. The bill came with fortune cookies of course. They have a lunch special menu which I recommend ordering from as food is alittle on the pricey end here. The lunch special is at the back of the menu. There was a nice calming atmosphere with music playing in the background. I liked that it was the right amount of lighting to give a nice business feel to the place. I liked that the air conditioning temperature was set perfectly as it was a hot day. We were seated immediately upon walking in which is always a bonus. You can always tell alit about a place from the state of the washroom. It was a beautiful washroom that was clean and modern. It goes without saying that the restaurant on a whole was clean, spacious and breathable. I think this is hardly the design for restaurants downtown. This pale cuts it. Overall, this is definitely a place worth trying. Service was good. I would visit again.",4.0,3.0,66,2017-08-11,43.647369,-79.386763,"Dim Sum , Asian Fusion"
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,"It was nice to discover that a new Asian restaurant had opened up close to where I live. I checked out the menu online and was excited to see they had ""xiao long bao"" (soup dumplings) - not easy to find in the downtown core. I visited on a Sunday night with my boyfriend. The restaurant is situated underground along King West and was a lot bigger than I expected. The Asian decor is relatively elaborate. Most of the tables were empty that night and  we were one of the few diners inside. We did, however, see many food delivery couriers come in and out to pick up food throughout the time we were there!The food itself was decent. We ordered the xiao long bao, fried pork dumplings, salt and pepper chicken, and beef noodles. The xiao long bao were well-made and filled with a good amount of soup inside. The fried pork dumplings were good too. The fried salt and pepper chicken was just average and we likely won't order this again. The beef noodles were delicious - flavourful soup, generous amounts of beef, and tasty noodles. We also shared a milk bubble tea - came in a large glass and was pretty good!Overall, we wouldn't hesitate to come back and order some of the same things again.",4.0,3.0,66,2017-01-22,43.647369,-79.386763,"Dim Sum , Asian Fusion"

This is the real deal. So glad this place exists. I would go as far as saying it's as good as some of the great dumpling places I've been to in Shanghai.

Some of the decor is kind of interesting to say the least...* * *We came with a group of 8, and received 5 menus. Well, other chinese places usually just give you 2 menus for a group of 8 so this isn't so bad. It's also a pretty expensive-looking menu compared to sheets of laminated paper with string bindings.Our server briefly walked us through the menu.All sorts of dishes that you would expect at a chinese restaurant: veggie, meats, noodle soups, fried rice/noodle. There are some dimsum dishes as well if you'd like to try some of those on the side.At the back of the menu there are lunch combos that come with white rice, spring roll, and a salad. You can substitute the rice for brown rice, fried rice, or chow mein for an extra $1.5 different bubble teas are available. For dessert you can order passion fruit custard, fried sesame balls, or tang yuan.* * *You don't get free tea. It comes as a drink order for $2.50.However, they give you this massive thermos with a tea bag, which is good for 3 or 4 people. The servers will check up on you from time to time, seeing if you would like re-fills on any beverages. Not sure if they charge extra for re-fills.* * *I ordered the ""Crystal pork belly"" lunch combo, black milk tea with tapioca, and fried sesame balls. The pork belly dish comes with 5 pieces of pork belly inside an edible bowl along with the combo items. It was very tender and juicy, and the soy sauce/sugar flavor wasn't too overpowering. The bubble tea was just ok. It comes in a mug and is about the size of a large cup from other bubble tea places.I liked the fried sesame balls. The inside was quite chewy, with a somewhat crisp exterior.It's a nice place to go if you're looking for a chinese restaurant in downtown core.",4.0,4.0,66,2016-11-18,43.647369,-79.386763,"Dim Sum , Asian Fusion"

Lee Chen Asian Bistro,"As far as Americanized Asian food goes, Lee Chen isn't bad.I was part of a large group at lunch, so I decided to just order from the ""Business Lunch"" menu. A quick perusal quickly brought me to the often-reliable General Tso Chicken (""stir fried w/onion & red chilies in a tangy spicy sauce"").A short time later, the food arrived. The presentation is certainly unique, as the restaurant serves the main dish in a bowl made out of a crispy wonton wrapper (ie the bowl is edible!) The dish also comes with a bowl of rice, a salad, and a spring roll (which was oddly served almost 10 minutes after I received the platter).The food is okay. It comes with a whole mess of red chilies, which are too spicy to eat. But the problem is, the dish is otherwise totally lacking in spice. It's actually pretty bland, to be frank. The small portion only adds insult to injury, but when coupled with the other items on the plate, it's a good amount of food. (The tasteless salad was pretty disastrous, admittedly, but the spring roll was good.)I guess for a quick lunch Lee Chen is fine, but I can't imagine ever returning when there are so many other options in the area.",4.0,3.0,66,2017-04-27,43.647369,-79.386763,"Dim Sum , Asian Fusion"

Trying out the steak and frites today. My coworker told me they serve godlike fries, possibly her favourite fries of all time. My dish comes with the soco fries so I'm excited to try them.Wow the portion sizes were huge! At least my coworkers' dishes were. I had my 7oz steak but my plate had a lot of fries on it. Trying out the steak, immediately I could tell that it would be disappointing. It wasn't cooked well at all and didn't even taste like steak. But moving onto the feature (lol?), these soco fries were crispy with garlic, parmesan, chopped herbs and caper aioli sprinkled on top. And if that wasn't enough for you, they provide you with a creamy garlic sauce to dip your fries in mmmmmmm! I personally prefer my fries slightly crispier, but I would stand by my coworker's claim that these are the best fries given that. Regardless though, the flavour packed into these fries were utterly addicting. Disclaimer: if you are a vampire I am not responsible for any injury as a result of trying these delicious fries.The service was pretty good throughout our meal. Food came relatively quickly and waiter came periodically to give us refill on water and ask for refills of beer. No complaints there.Now in terms of the value, $26 for steak and fries is quite cheap by Toronto's standards. So, I wasn't extremely surprised by the quality of the steak when it arrived. The portion sizes were huge though and I was quite stuffed. On the other hand, if you only want to try their fries, it's only $7 for an order which is a little bit on the pricier side but well justifies the price in my opinion.In conclusion, don't let the fact that this restaurant is located in a hotel discourage you. I had a great meal here and would be excited to come back for their fries every so often. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier.

Soco Kitchen and Bar,"Soco Kitchen and Bar is a small restaurant with a sports bar feel on the ground floor of the Delta hotel in the Toronto financial district. I've been here a few times now, half for business lunches and half on my own. I've always found it easy to get a table for one or a group of four. For larger groups, it's best to call ahead to reserve.My first visit was a team lunch the past summer. I had a black cod dish that I thought would be similar to what you'd get at a Japanese restaurant. It was not. I was also disappointed with the flavor.Recently, I decided to give Soco another try because it was freezing outside and I didn't want food court food. I was interested in pasta, so I ordered the duck bolognese. It was fantastic, and I ordered it again on repeat visits. You can taste that the pappardelle pasta is freshly made. The ground duck is savory and delicious. I couldn't tell that it was duck. It includes a scoop of cold ricotta, which goes so well with the pasta. Getting a taste of ricotta, pasta, and ground duck in every bite is pure heaven.On one of my last visits, I also ordered the mushroom soup. It had a very earthy flavor to it. At the bottom was a sliver of portobello mushroom and two quarters of a button or cremini mushroom. The soup is garnished with freshly ground black peppercorns.

The calamari was a bit disappointing. It wasn't fried, but cooked and served with this chick pea and tomato paste. The Brussels sprouts however, were amazing. Much better than I thought.

Again, I wouldn't recommend going for dinner. While the food did taste good, it was overpriced for what you were getting. In addition, service was slow and it took a long time to get our food.

There were a few groups heading to the game as well, and a few people who were likely staying at the hotel. The restaurant was modern and clean.Food: We went on a Tuesday night and they had a special- $21 for a pint of Steamwhistle and the Bacon Cheeseburger. We also ordered fries and the Fig Flatbread Pizza. The burger was phenomenal!  Fries were thin and crispy, covered in Parmesan which made them even tastier. The pizza was sweet and delicious. When I come back, I probably won't order the pizza again but will definitely opt for the burger.Service: There were about 3 hostesses at the time, who seated us immediately. We waited a bit longer than expected for our food, but our waitress was kind and attentive.Location: In the core of downtown, connected to the Delta hotel, a few minutes away from the ACC and Rogers Centre. Price: Average for downtown and the area. A meal for two cost about $50 plus tax and tip.",3.0,4.0,130,2017-05-31,43.642653,-79.383847,"Bars , Canadian (New)"

Soco Kitchen and Bar,"Came here for the first time before the Raptors game. Passed by a lot, never been inside. To start we ordered the Arancini and award winning Mac n Cheese. The Arancini had mushrooms and melted cheese inside, with a crisp outer shell. They were delicious, 4 for $10. The mac n cheese, also delicious, made with fresh delicious cheese and a special blend of herbs was only $5 for a small bowl, easily shared between two people. For the mains we kept it simple. Got the SOCO burger, which has smoked bacon and a delicious jam type ketchup. Paired with skinny fries (comparable to McDonalds cut, sans all the sodium). They came with a garlic, caper aioli dipping sauce to die for! Def worth a try. The burger itself was very fresh, made from minced meat, perhaps hand made? It would crumble as I was eating it. Came on a light fluffy brioche bun, which kept things light. I wasn't taking the belt off for this meal. Truly delicious comfort food here. Enjoyed my first visit here a lot.

I walked in fully intending to order a salad, but got waylayed by the 5 cheese mac and cheese on the menu. It was creamy, heavy. and comforting.

Soco Kitchen and Bar,"I came here on a Saturday evening for a friend's birthday.  Soco is located inside the Delta Toronto hotel on Lower Simcoe but the street entrance is on the Brenmer Blvd side.  Being part of the building of 75 Simcoe and being the main restaurant in the hotel you can also access the restaurant from the hotel lobby.Soco has a couple seating areas, one facing Brenmer, an outdoor section which is seasonal and the main dining area which consists of the bar, lounge area with long couch seating as well as low and high top tables.  We were seating adjacent to the lounge area with attached tables and although the seats were pretty much touching one another, the seating was very comfortable and the chairs are wide so that it created ""buffer"" space simply by being as wide as they were.  The tables were large enough for all our drinks and the wide variety of starters we had coming our way one after another while Alex our server had our drinks well taken care of.  At one point I had just finished my drink and Alex came by like a ninja and asked me if I'd like another.  I was so surprised I almost had trouble saying yes.The variety of starters we sampled were all very good.  The cheese and crostini was first with a variety of soft and hard cheeses it was a nice sized starter for sharing.  Next came the Mezze which was another share plate which consisted of a smoked pepper and ricotta dip and a spicy chickpea hummus with a generous bowl of olives and a side of warm flat bread.  The hummus tasted great and wasn't too spicy.  The pepper and ricotta dip although it had a tiny kick it also was not hot and overly spicy but rather a very nice definitive taste.  The charcuterie had a nice variety of salami and mustard seed and toast.  While the toast was good I preferred the warm flatbread that came with the dips.My wife had wanted to try the corn chowder because it's one of her favorite soups.  The bowl came empty with a few kernels of popcorn in the bowl with some cilantro leaves and the soup was poured from a decanter into the bowl in front of her.  The soup had an amazing taste of mildly sweet corn but with the smallest of late spice kick of jalapeno peppers.  This dish was not too hot for my wife and she normally cannot handle hot at all and it was perfect for her.  The soup is more of a thinner consistency but the taste is great.  There are small cubes of chorizo to add another flavor to the mix of soup as well so it's sweet and savory with a hint of spice to finish.  Amazing flavor for the corn chowder soup...My wife had ordered the lobster tagliatelle as her main but because she ate so many starters she basically barely touched it.  I tasted it and it was rich with that lobster while the pasta dish itself is not something I have very often considering I don't eat lobster that often.  It now is today's lunch for me.  For my main I went with the steak, medium rare.  I enjoy a good steak from time to time and this was cooked medium rare as requested, not overcooked and a good size.  The potatoes that accompanied the fine cut had a chimichurri sauce but I had wished it had more.  It was very light to the point I didn't get too much of a taste of it.  The mustard and herb butter compound on the steak added another level of taste to the steak.  As it melted it added a nice tang to the meat that wasn't too lubricated but rather nice with the potatoes and asparagus as well.   On the side I couldn't resist ordering the 5 cheese mac and cheese and adding the braised beef option to it.  The mac and cheese came in a what looked to be about a 2 cup sized bowl topped with bread crumbs.  On the menu this mac and cheese dish is listed as a side and it's also listed as the 2015 and 2016 Toronto Mac & Cheese best of festival champion.  I'm sorry to say I think those descriptions raised the bar for my expectations in that I was expecting to be blown away and I just was not.  The mac and cheese for me seemed rather runny and a touch sweet.  I prefer savory and rich mac and cheese over this offering.  The braised beef added a dimension of change of texture and flavor of course but not enough to counter the sweetness of the sauce.  While it was nice to try I wouldn't recommend it to those expecting a saltier, richer and more savory mac and cheese.  Overall the presentation, quality and service of Soco is very good, not quite mind blowing 5* but definitely better than average for their variety and tastes.  Nothing seemed overly bold but nothing was sadly tame either.  The service we received was exceptional as the staff couldn't seem to do enough for us.",3.0,4.0,130,2016-11-07,43.642653,-79.383847,"Bars , Canadian (New)"
Soco Kitchen and Bar,"This place was meh. Super overpriced for what it was. We got bloody caesars and they were not good at all -- super watered down, warm, and seriously lacking flavor. They brought a tub of ice on the side, which I found kinda odd since drinks are typically brought to you at the right temperature, not with a side of ice to cool down the hot alcohol brought to you. We shared the Meze platter, which came with pita with hummus as well as some smoky cheese dip, plus some olives. This was pretty tasty. I also had some of my cousin's burger and it was tasty which makes me think you should just stick with the food here, NOT their drinks (even though 'bar' is in their name).

The Wren,"It was a regular Wednesday night in the big city. After going for drinks, my friend and I were hungry. This place was on social media and we were both curious. We drove down the Danforth and spent about 20 minutes going back and forth looking for parking. There was ZERO on-street parking available. We drove down to the nearest green p lost which was kinda far. It was about a 15 minute walk. We walked in to a very small bumping restaurant, bar stools were taken by upbeat folks and the back was loud and busy. We waited about 20 minutes for a table, while waiting we ordered a drink at the bar. Bar service was good. My only compliant was it was very squished. Finally we got called to our table. A squished seat in between 2 other couples on a picnic bench. We ordered the Guac and Chips which were average. My friend and I were here to try the Uncle Buck Burger; charred beef burger, with onions rings, pickles, thousand island dressing, bbq sauce and bacon. Sounds great right? It looked and sounded delicious. I was down! The fries were also delicious; crispy the way I like it. My only compliant about the burger is the meat lacked some flavour and it was too charred for my liking. The toppings worked well. What I didn't like is my overall experience; the seating, the small space, the no parking. Keep Eating, Angela",4.0,3.0,150,2018-01-20,43.68241,-79.32805,"Bars , American (Traditional)"
The Wren,Weird little place... Entering the place at about 3:50 on a Sunday afternoon my girlfriend and I were met with a blank stare from the barman before he coughed out a greeting that included the kitchen was closed from 3-4 but should be opening soon. We sat and waited on service hoping to at least have a drink while we waited on food... We waited and watched as the barman read the paper and completely ignored us. Finally we went to the bar and ordered for ourselves. At 4 I guess there was a shift change and a waitress came by to take our food order... Another deer in the headlights gaze... Figuring we weren't going to stay long we ordered some buffalo cauliflower to pick at while we finished our drinks... Arrived pretty quickly but mushy and overcooked.

The Wren,"Every time I've been to The Wren it's been for either a tap takeover or part of a pub/bar crawl.  I recently found myself there for yet another tap takeover, so I figure it's about time I reviewed the venue.  The Wren is small and not particularly upscale (except for the washroom).  It does, however, boast both a great beer selection and great food.  It's also in a convenient location, being not too far east of Greenwood subway station and also nearby a number of other bars, etc.As I've only been to the venue for the aforementioned special Events, it's always been or became quite crowded while I was there but I can't recall service - either at the bar or tables - having ever been quite negatively impacted as a result.  Due to its size, I don't recommend The Wren for large(r) Groups unless you can snag at least 1 of the picnic tables in the center of their seating area.  The noise level, predictably does become quite high when the place is pretty crowded.I definitely recommend The Wren if you haven't been and find yourself in the neighbourhood.",4.0,5.0,150,2017-03-08,43.68241,-79.32805,"Bars , American (Traditional)"

The Wren,"I wanted to really like The Wren, I really did. But I gotta say, in between the mouthwatering beer offerings, the much raved grub, and the beaten-to-death laminated food menu, service can be.. uh.. spotty.Always popular, always packed is a common theme for this Danforth diner since it opened. And it was even featured on ""You Gotta Eat Here"" on the Canadian Food Network. It's only now that I have gotten a chance to come and snag a seat and see for myself why I gotta eat here.But I gotta say, it seems the level of service afforded to you depends where you sit. Of course you are unmissable sitting at the bar. It's when you are at the front window when staff attention drops to nearly zero. Amongst the chaos of an average Friday evening, where people do queue up inside for an open table, they actually thought for more than 10 minutes I was waiting for other people, no wonder I was menu-less for so long! It wasn't just me struggling for a server--a couple beside me took a few tries to snag someone so they can get some food finally. Maybe they need to zone out their space, I dunno--several staff were playing host, it was all over the place.The 'Uncle Buck Burger' ($16) I settled for was stacked with a large beer battered onion ring, which had this interesting smoky caramel flavour to it. A bitty bit of Thousand Islands dressing added, it was not very effective. It was alright, not as mindexpanding as anticipated but bit of a beast to eat, and comes with some very crispy crisp fries.The Wren has a varied patron base of different age groups reflective of one big part of the Danforth community... and maybe a few greasy foodies thrown in there somewhere.

The Wren,"The various burger offerings at The Wren seem to be constantly highlighted on Instagram, so it was just a matter of time before I found myself sitting down for a meal.(Ironically, I didn't even order a burger.)We arrived just before noon on a Saturday and the place was already bustling. After sitting down at one of the last free tables, I perused the menu and quickly decided to order the Brisket Hash (""shredded beef brisket, potato, onion, and seasonal vegetables. Served with warm cornbread & two sunny side up eggs"").It's a good dish, although it saddens me to say that it was not served hot. It was barely room temperature when I received it, and this continues to be one of my biggest pet peeves at restaurants. (Seriously, how difficult is it to serve a hot meal hot?)Anyway, the food is otherwise very tasty. The hash is quite flavorful and packed with tasty elements, although the beef brisket itself was a little on the sparse side. (I quite enjoyed the innovation of using french fries in place of potatoes, which gave the whole thing a kind of poutine-like feel.) The cornbread is decent, especially for Toronto. (I don't think I've ever had cornbread in the city that even comes close to the stuff you get in the States.)I should also mention that the service was fairly subpar, as my dining companion's water glass sat empty for more than half the meal.",4.0,3.0,150,2017-05-28,43.68241,-79.32805,"Bars , American (Traditional)"
The Wren,Good little spot.  We were there on a very cold night.  We arrived with a party of 4 and were told there was room in the middle of one of the bench seats.  We opted to wait the promised 10 - 15 minutes.  We were offered drinks and started to wait.  More and more groups showed up and it got very busy in the waiting area.  There was a table at the back of the restaurant that we asked about after we'd waited 20 minutes and  were told it was for groups of 5 or more... we were 4. After a long wait we got our table right beside the big table at the back.  The big table sat empty as we ate our dinner.  The food was good pub food and it was a cozy spot.  I was personally really frustrated with the wait and would have been more frustrated if a group of 5 had shown up to be seated before us after waiting the half hour plus for a table.  I would not rush back to the The Wren as I did my think it was anything special.,4.0,3.0,150,2018-01-12,43.68241,-79.32805,"Bars , American (Traditional)"

Pictures online make it seem bigger, so I was a bit surprised to arriving around 6pm and the place already being full with a waiting list for a table. Luckily there was room at the bar for me to saddle up alongside.This place was on my radar as it's been known for it's craft beer selection, and on that front it did not disappoint at all. They had about a dozen craft options including options from great Ontario brewers such as Indie Ale House, GLB, Bellwoods, Side Launch, and Redline to name a few. Beers range in 12, 14, or 16 oz pours depending on what you fancy.Foodwise, I ordered the Uncle Buck Burger which is their premium burger topped with a friend onion ring and some bacon and white cheddar cheese amongst other things. On first look, I thought this was going to be the best burger I've had in ages. It had plate appeal, juicy meat and some decent looking fries on the side. It was a good burger, but admittedly I'm not sure if it was the thousand island dressing (which I normally am down with), but something just seemed a bit off in its flavour. It was still enjoyable, but fell a bit short which is the sole reason I've got to stick with a 4 star review.But the place is quaint and cute and the service is friendly.

Canoe,"Note that I didn't actually eat at Canoe but this is my experience making a reservation for Winterlicious 2018. Canoe may be the one restaurant that I constantly get raving recommendations on their exquisite food, but unfortunately my first encounter with them was extremely unpleasant. I called to make a reservation, and was content if I couldn't get a table because I know how popular Canoe is. However the receptionist on the phone was either unprofessional, unhelpful, or hates her job. It was like pulling teeth when I tried to get information from her, and she did not sounded like she cared or tried to offer any solutions to solve a problem. I also didn't get a reservation at another Winterlicious restaurant, but the receptionist there was welcoming, made sure I was informed, and tried to provide a solution to my problem. It seems like people that visit Canoe during their usual occasions receive great services, and not so much when it comes to Winterlicious/Summerlicious. If that is the case, Canoe, you would be much better off not participating in these events and save the time of your customers from going through these horrible experiences. If my first encounter with a restaurant already leaves such a bad taste afterwards, I am very reserved on whether I would be visiting this place at all, regardless of how exquisite their food is.",4.0,1.0,552,2018-01-11,43.646954,-79.382159,Canadian (New)

Canoe,"Based on Summerlicious, I found my new special occasion spot. Beautifully decorated with a huge sitting space and an amazing view of Toronto, this place serves contemporary food.However, service could be better. They start with bread and hummus (they called roasted chickpea something), and they will refill it if you ask for.  Drinks selection was pretty good, particularly cocktails.Funnel Pickled salad to start with, was a perfect combination of fresh crisp veggies, sweet and sourness. For mains I ordered Risoni Risotto, they were delicious, perfectly cooked. For desserts, I and my hubby shared a Summer berry crumble & Flourless chocolate cake, both were delicious with generous portions. The ambience is really romantic and the view from 54th floor is gorgeous.My husband ordered Foie Gras Parfait for starters, Ontario braised lamb shoulder for mains. He loved both of them, mains, in particular, the juicy tender lamb with distinctive flavours, well cooked.The only thing we were not impressed was, service, proper attention was not paid to us, we had to call our server many times for water or cutlery, we would have preferred a little more interactive server.But Yeah, I am visiting them again, may be we get a better server this time.We parked at 145 king, a reasonable parking nearby.",4.0,4.0,552,2017-08-02,43.646954,-79.382159,Canadian (New)
Canoe,Came here for summerlicious.  Was another great experience.  I got the smoke salmon salad as appetizer and it's so far the best dish I have had this summerlicious.  The salmon was soft and tasted good.  The veggies and sauces added many different flavours to the dish and went well with the salmon. For main I got the tuna dish. Overall I thought the dish was average.  The tuna was more over cooked than I would like.  Also it had a strong fishy taste too it. The other components to the dish was good but nothing stood out.For dessert I got the berry crumble.  I liked the crumbles and there was a good amount of berries.  Didn't like the liquid was in the bottom of the jar. After mixing the liquid with the crumble the dish started looking unappetizing.,4.0,4.0,552,2017-07-21,43.646954,-79.382159,Canadian (New)
Canoe,"Licking my fingers just reminiscing about the buttery Quebec foie gras that I just had for dinner at Canoe Summerlicious 2017. The yuzu, ginger crumble and stone fruit were the perfect accompaniment to this sublime and unique dish.As always, Canoe Restaurant is top notch, fantastic and possibly one of the best restaurants in Canada.  It totally deserves all its critical acclaims and merits.Canoe always has been my IT destination for licious despite the reservations are so hard to make (dialing 300 times or being on hold for one hour) but it was totally worth it in the end. I highly recommend to go there if you have never experience this excellent restaurant before.The restaurant provides top notch professional service and high quality dishes  using  Canadian local ingredients. And don't forget the breathtaking and beautiful views of the city. Parking is validated in the evenings from 5:30 pm and during the day on the weekends.I am very happy that City of Toronto and @liciousto for having Canoe as one of the participant for the yearly Winterlicious / Summerlicious programs where Torontonians can benefit prix a fixe three-courses lunch and/or dinner.",4.0,5.0,552,2017-07-10,43.646954,-79.382159,Canadian (New)
Canoe,"3.5/5 Disclaimer: Solely based off the Summerlicious dinner menu. This is my first summerlicious experience so was surprised when I managed to land a reservation (for two). Came around 6 pm and was seated without any issues. Its too bad we didn't get a window seat because the view is truly phenomenal. As for the food, it was decent but I expected to be blown away given the prestige of Canoe. The fois gras (app) was my favourite of the set, with the caramel and ginger crumble giving a nice light touch. The strip loin (main) was cooked perfectly (med rare) but lacked flavor. The cheek was a tad dry but at least the side vegetables tasted alright if that's anything. The mint chocolate torte (dessert) looked way too sweet for my liking, but it actually tasted alright. Wish the portions were a bit bigger overall. Definitely picture worthy, wish it was more food worthy. Was nice to experience during Summerlicious nonetheless.",4.0,3.0,552,2017-07-25,43.646954,-79.382159,Canadian (New)
Canoe,"I have mixed feelings about Canoe. It's the darling of the Financial District; a ""must-go-to-if-you-haven't"" and as such a common choice for business meetings, team dinners, etc. for those on Bay Street and in the vicinity.The first time I went to Canoe it was for Summerlicious (dinner). I would not recommend this having recently gone for a (regular) lunch and had a far superior experience. Perhaps it was my choices (duck terrine appetizer, steak as a main, and I believe cheesecake-esque dessert) but nothing apart from the dessert was particularly memorable. The terrine was a bit dry and the steak somewhat rubbery and more fatty than I'd expect. Dessert was great - light, picturesque, sweet but not overly so.Lunch a few weeks ago was an entirely different story - I ordered a pasta special (it was tagliatelle with a lamb ragu). Superb - absolutely wonderful. Such rich flavours, and a goat cheese layer on top that paired beautifully with the meat and pasta. It was all so warm and melted together like strings of notes in perfect harmony. Dessert was, again, fantastic - I got the hazelnut torte which came with a few component pieces (a stick of torte which was chocolatey and nutty and altogether quite nice, a meringue of sorts that I can't say I loved but still found very creative and inventive). It was great and I'd recommend it easily.Overall - I found this can be a bit of a hit or miss, but when it's a hit, it's really something memorable. Also - great view!",4.0,3.0,552,2017-11-12,43.646954,-79.382159,Canadian (New)
Canoe,"I had a lovely birthday dinner at Canoe. My boyfriend had mentioned it was my birthday when making the reservation and we had a fantastic table looking our over the lake. The servers and the manager all said happy birthday to me, which was also a nice touch. I really liked the ambiance of the restaurant - upscale but very comfortable, and fairly quiet so good for conversation. I felt more relaxed as soon as I sat down. The food ranged from good to amazing. The salad we had to start (green bean with pea shoots and watercress) was one of the best salads I've had in a restaurant. The combination of ingredients and flavours was very unique, and it was perfectly dressed. We also shared the smoked arctic char which I thought was just okay (not a ton of flavour, and a tiny portion). Our mains were excellent - I had pickerel and my boyfriend had pork. My dish had a large piece of fish and the sides were well-chosen, made for a good combination of flavours and textures. We also shared a side of broccoli rabe and japanese asparagus which was decent. For dessert we shared the butter tart which was delicious (and happy birthday was written on the plate in chocolate, another nice touch). Overall, we had a great meal and good service. I'm leaving off a star only because at the price point of the restaurant, I was hoping to be blown away by every dish which wasn't quite the case. Regardless, I would definitely recommend Canoe for a special occasion and would love to go back some day!",4.0,4.0,552,2017-08-03,43.646954,-79.382159,Canadian (New)
Canoe,"Canoe was a good place to take your SO or your parents to dinner. In terms of quality and pricing, i was happy with the food and service and price. However, it would not be the best I've had in Toronto. The food was tasty, but I felt like they put a crumble on everything. We had the tasting menu and it came out in a timely order and the servers were very attentive to our needs.

Canoe,"Canoe never disappoints me. From the second I walk in with the view, even on a gloomy day.Appetizer: Cured rainbow trout, nori, Taramasalata,Ink cracker and seaweed persillade. It was a good portion for appetizer and the flavours were good.Albacore tuna, at first when I saw licorice potatoe, I wasn't looking forward as I don't like licorice at all. I even asked if I can substitute.  However they told me that it's very light. The flavour was very unique and went surprisingly well with the potatoe. The holland marsh leeks was tasty and fresh. This plate usually have all the ingredients that I don't like but turned out well.I find my mint chocolate torte was a bit dried so I tried my friends lemon tarte. It was much better.

Canoe,"Came here on a scattered storm night and bf was able to see the lightening with the most amazing view. The food and service was exceptional.Had a reservation last minute and they were able to accommodate us even after we changed the timing twice.Had the aged pork and was surprised with a side of blood pudding. I've always wanted to try it since Andrew Zimmern is my best friend (he just doesn't know it yet.) It was perfectly balanced with a hint of spice notes such as clove or cinnamon I believe. The pork was perfectly cooked. If I could eat the bone, I would.Bf had the fish (forgot the name and type) and was extremely pleased. I took a nibble and it immediately melted in my mouth. We were both super pleased with our choices. Over all--Modern, clean, great view, delicious food and lovely wine.

Canoe,"Canoe is a Toronto institution. The views at Canoe are gorgeous. You can enjoy great views of the CN Tower, the city and the islands during your mean. The open kitchen allows you to watch the symphony of energy that goes into preparing your meal and adds to the atmosphere. The menu plays homage to some of the finest ingredients found in various regions in Canada. The dishes (appetizers, entree and dessert) were all well prepared. The dishes were well thought out and flavourful. However, given the price and the other options in Toronto, I did not give Canoe full points. The service was attentive.

Canoe,"Came here for an anniversary with my boyfriend at 10:30pm (final seating). We made a reservation a month ahead of time to guarantee a window table.  As soon as you walk in, you are greeted by extremely friendly servers and hostesses. We looked online ahead of time to see the menu, so we ordered before the kitchens closed. The atmosphere was amazing and the view was stunning. The place itself is really nice and fancy. Everyone wore suits and dresses in the evening. The food came within 10-15 minutes, decently fast, but in my opinion all of their menu is extremely overpriced. My boyfriend ordered the Ontario beef rib eye, and I ordered the northern woods mushroom soup with a side of pan roasted carrots. The steak was tasty, as were the carrots, but the soup was just strange to me. It's texture is very gritty and not very soup like, I did not enjoy it because of that. This place is nice for special occasions, birthdays, anniversaries, etc...or maybe if you're trying to impress a girl. ;)Overall lovely experience, but too overpriced.",4.0,3.0,552,2017-02-20,43.646954,-79.382159,Canadian (New)

Canoe,"I've been to Canoe several times but this is my first review of this restaurant.  I've always came at lunch and I remember the food being excellent.  My bestie had her wedding at Canoe and I have to say it was the best wedding food I've ever had at any weddings I've been to.  If you're looking for a wedding venue book Canoe.  Also my bestie told me the cost was reasonable compared to other venues downtown.  My review this time around is for my birthday dinner.  Canoe is located downtown at the TD plaza on the 54th floor.  The views are amazing of the Toronto skyline.   When you walk in you can have your coat checked.  Our main server was a little cold and unfriendly. But the other staff from the front desk, greeter, coat check staff,  water refill staff to the food servers were all extremely friendly throughout the restaurant so it offset our main server's grumpiness so I'm still giving them a 5 star anyways.   When the food was brought out the food servers took their time explaining what each item was on the plate.  The presentation was top notch. We started off with the complimentary fresh bread with hummus dip. So good! For starters we got the mushroom soup which was a little bland but still good.  I guess it a good thing it's not too salty.  Then for our entrees we both got  the smoked duck dish.  I had mine done medium my bestie got hers medium raw which is how it's served.   I usually get medium well and it was perfect.  If it's too well done the meat becomes tough and dry.   For dessert I had the chocolate + Nancy mint dish. So so good and perfect portions because we were full but still wanted to try the desserts there.  Overall I was extremely happy with my meal. One of the best Birthday meals I've had for my Birthday month.  It's quite pricy, our bill came  to close to $200 for 2 people and we didn't even order alcohol! So if you drink it would be a lot more.  Coming here for a special occasion is a great treat!",4.0,5.0,552,2017-12-06,43.646954,-79.382159,Canadian (New)
Canoe,"Visited this restaurant a while ago. Book reservations a head for a window seat. The restaurant was pretty empty on a Friday night.  When you first enter there's coat check. The hostess and staffs were really friendly. We ordered the foie gras, seafood platter and some steak dish. The foie gras was pretty good. The steak was ok. The seafood platter was decent. Although the oysters were provided by oyster boys. They weren't the best ones. The dessert we order was some chocolate cake. The cake was really dry and hard. They ice cream was good though. Service is great, They let you test both wines before you order. The food is honestly not that great. It was expensive, your pretty much paying for service and the view. We went around sunset so you can see the whole view of the city and the sunset. You can see the cn tower too.

Canoe,"Came for lunch during Winterlicious 2017.When it comes to Canoe, unless you're here for business or it's just another regular place by your standards, you'll probably be going tourist-mode, pressed up against the windows looking down on the world below you and into the horizon. Of course, with a camera.Or perhaps that is just something I do, given that the other diners were well-dressed and I'm pretty much out-of-place. But it is winterlicious, you're likely to attract uncultured commoners such as myself that typically prefer to grab a lunch special from chinatown.Everything is well-maintained. Kitchen looks really clean. Washrooms are top-notch, though they don't have any hand-dryers. Instead they opted for paper towels..We were seated at the west corner facing the CN tower, so there were a lot of viewing options, whether it's out into the lake on the south side, or west towards Mississauga. Because it was daytime, and snowstorm was forecasted throughout the day, we had the opportunity to observe how the distant cities looked when there's a huge snowstorm falling down on them. It was quite a sight, and something you wouldn't be able to see at night.Each dish comes with a wine pairing, if you would like to go that route.All of the dishes I ordered were great. From the foie gras, to the chuck flat, to the chocolate fondant. The beef was so tender that you could literally pick pieces apart with chopsticks.Service was good. Waiter walked over often to check up on things like water and feedback on dishes. Allowed me to challenge the dessert with chopsticks by limiting my choice of utensils. I don't know if this would be considered unacceptable, but for me it was all good.I don't know whether winterlicious reflects regular service, or how amazing the food really is for those with more experienced palates (given that I see a lot of less than stellar reviews on the food), but for me it's pretty much up there.",4.0,5.0,552,2017-01-31,43.646954,-79.382159,Canadian (New)
Chabrol Restaurant,"I've only had the pleasure of coming here for dessert, and it is amazing. The service is incredible. We were greeted at the door with smiles, the host took our jackets and we sat at our table. The whole restaurant is very very small, it maybe seats 20 people. We had the Crème Brûlée which was amazing, exactly the way it should be. Creamy Creme at the bottom and the top had a perfect crust. Next up... WARNING... The Apple Tarte with Calvados Sabayon. FUCKING PERFECT. This came much later as it takes about 25 minutes to cook. The pastry itself is perfect, buttery and crisp. The thin apples are then topped with the Sabayon which is a custardy sauce that has a bit of liquor. The Combination of flavours is overwhelming. It's a great date spot and I would recommend it.",4.0,5.0,53,2018-01-17,43.671049,-79.391714,French

I was fortunate enough to go with my family; as such, was able to enjoy a larger array of appetizers, entrees and dessert than I would have if I went with a smaller party. I am only sad that my pants and stomach would not allow me to consume more. All this means is that we shall have to return again for their seasonal menu changes and regular specials. I can only have have high praises for all the items ordered and look forward to be awed again. Final note, I think I'd just visit for their apple pie if they'd let me , but will fail by wanting to order an appetizer and entree too.",4.0,5.0,53,2017-12-31,43.671049,-79.391714,French

Then the lamb with provencal vegetables.  The potato gratin with that was outstanding.  Wine matches were very well done and super consultative approach was used. Also enjoyed the amazing apple tart and an espresso along with an armanac.One of the nicest parts was a willingness to allow our courses to be shared and that extended to the wine.

Chabrol Restaurant,"My boyfriend took me here for dinner during the weekend. He mentioned that he booked a table one month prior so I'd highly recommend booking well in advance! Chabrol is a boutique-sized restaurant. It seats 5 tables of 2 and a bar of approximately 10 people. We were lucky to be seated away from the group of 2's or else everyone would basically eavesdrop each others' conversations haha. Overall, I think Chabrol is a great impress-your-date place. Unfortunately, the quality of the food wasn't as good as I expected.DRINKS:* Domaine Merlin Chardonnay 2014 - Macon La Roche Vineuse (mine)* Pinot Noir (his)* RIESLING-POACHED FOIE GRAS with black currant and salsify (2/5)Ok.. I LOVE foie gras. I had very high hopes for this fancy sounding riesling-poached foie gras! Unfortunately, it was rather.. stinky(?) I really didn't like this. 2 points are given for the nicely displayed pieces of bread and salsify haha. Great for Instagram.* TARTINE OF RABBIT with braised endive (3.5/5)We felt a little guilty for ordering rabbit meat but the meat was delicious...!! It's a simple appetizer to cleanse your palettes before the mains. Even though this dish had a lot of bread, it wasn't overwhelming. I'd recommend sharing this dish between two people.* ""TTORO"" (4/5)This was delicious - I'd recommend this soup. It tastes like a squash soup with fresh seafood. Seafood included fish, mussels and shrimps. The fish was delicious! The soup was not overly thick so it didn't make us feel bloated afterwards. * MUSCOVY DUCK with barigoule of artichokes, chestnuts, fennel and pearl onions (2/5)It's a boiled duck with watered-down flavour. What stood out to me the most were the chestnuts in the dish. Otherwise, the whole dish was quite bland in taste. The duck meat was way too soggy. I wouldn't recommend ordering this.DESSERTS:* APPLE TARTE with calvados sabayon (4/5)Our server highly recommended the apple tarte for desserts. Good recommendation! The apples were still crispy, which paired nicely with the soft pastry for the tarte. The sauce they poured on top was creamy and light.

Chabrol Restaurant,"A wonderful 4.5 star experience ... service is very good and elevated this from a 4 to a 4.5Chabrol is a small dining gem in Toronto.  It's menu, like its space, is small but extremely well thought out & curated and very well executed. Service here has the perfect balance of being friendly and refined.  Chabrol is not an easy reservation to get ... it is popular but also there's only 5 tables of 2 and a few seats at the bar.  It is a tiny spot in Yorkville where you'll be amazed at the chef's ""kitchen"".  It is the size of a closet and yet some of the most wonderful big flavours come from it. We arrived and walked through their patio courtyard area which houses some 4 person tables.  It had been raining hard that day and though it was covered, watch for the little puddles!  We were warmly greeted by what seemed to be the sous chef who is outside the restaurant in a temporary bar area.  Quickly we were shown to our seat and possibly the most cheerful wait staff attended to our table. I can understand previous comments about how it is possibly too intimate.  You are within inches of your neighbouring table and your table is very small.  It can barely hold two dinner plates, a side dish, and an entree plate.  Much negotiating with the dinner ware was needed.We decided to split all the items to enjoy the various flavours and in some ways, I shouldn't have!  I really did want to keep the Ttoro to myself!  We did order the Ttoro (Basque seafood stew), Braised Lamb, Escarole Gratin, and finished with wonderful Apple tarte.Ttoro - This Basque stew was quite amazing on flavour.  It is a stew based on fish, tomato, shellfish, and normally a paprika of some sort.  Perhaps my mind was slipping but I thought I heard the staff describe saffron being added and no mention of paprika.  The fish and shellfish is added last minute to poach just before serving.  The broth is delicious... they give you in house made crust bread (pain de campagne?) to scoop every last drip of the wonderful soup and trust me, you'd want to lick the plate.  It is a vibrant bold spiced flavour.  It wasnt overwhelming on the shellfish but I was surprised how the white fish, mussel, and shrimp took little of the broth flavour.  I wouldn't call them tasteless but they just didnt any noted flavour.  The mussels were quite small... about a half the size of the ones we had at Kiin.  The shrimp was a touch bordering towards rubbery.  The fish was a touch too dry/firm instead of moist and delicate.  The broth is a 5+/5 but the seafood was ok.  So overall 4/5Braised Lamb - Another solid dish ... the lamb didn't need any knife to cut through it.  It was incredibly tender.  An interesting thing about the lamb, it wasn't remotely gamey or had the typical strong 'lamb' flavour.  It was well complimented by the fennel and asparagus.  The fennel had that licorice note but instead of making everything taste like black licorice ... it added a nice earthy herbal note.  The overall flavour was muted and comforting... this is a dish I would welcome on a cold day.  Well done but comparing to the Ttoro, it just haven't the same 'wow' flavour profile. 4/5Escarole gratin - This eclipsed the braised lamb completely when they were served together.  Thinly sliced celeriac is treated like a potato and layered with escarole, savoury, cheese, and bread crumbs to top.  This was soo good.  Crunchy flavourful breadcrumbs covered the creamy cheese and tender pieces of celeriac to create a better and more flavourful version of potato dauphinoise.  It is quite a generous plating of this side dish.  5/5Apple Tarte - It is rare for me to say the must order dish is dessert but in this case, this apple tarte deserves that recognition.  Buttery flakey pastry that puffs around a tower of thinly slice and tender apples  then enveloped and drowned in an amazing sabayon that is perfectly sweet and notes of cider popping out.  This is one of the better desserts I've had all year and I've possibly had too much.  You can see the chef use a double bain marie and put some serious work in whipping the yolks, cider, and sugar to get that incredible creamy texture that can easily fool you to thinking its cream.  5/5Overall, this is a wonderful fine dining experience with the service possibly overshadowing some of the food. It's not often you find a good balance between refined & thoughtful service and kicking out the pretentious attitude of some finer dining places.  The Apple Tarte is truly amazing though!",4.0,4.0,53,2017-07-04,43.671049,-79.391714,French
Chabrol Restaurant,"Chabrol is a small restaurant in Yorkville. It is a bit of a hidden gem.

Chabrol is able to turn out amazing dishes by using just two induction burners and a convection oven.To start, we had the foie gras.

It also went well with the red wine that was recommended by our server.

Chabrol Restaurant,"I made a reservation for Chabrol two weeks in advance, but when we actually arrived there were still a few seats left at the bar. The atmosphere is lively and incredibly loud, so you end up shouting for your friend to hear you.The restaurant is quite small and the kitchen is even smaller. You can see it from the bar, and it's literally one chef busily making delicious dishes. If you want to use the washroom it's downstairs.My sister and I split the appetizer (pork liver mousse, quite yummy) and the dessert (the famous apple tart!). For the dessert they pour the fluffy cream over the tart right in front of your eyes. We got the lamb and the duck, both of which comes with bread to soak up the sauce. We ended up packing them to go because the portion was quite large. I'm giving Chabrol a really high rating because their service is so friendly and wonderful! Their staff is chatty, always smiling, and attentive to your needs. I dropped by on my birthday and they gave me dessert with a little candle on top. Usually after your meal the restaurant will serve you a mint or a candy, and at Chabrol they gave handmade lemon... cookies? I'm not sure how to describe them. As well, the waiters were very generous with the lemon cookies! If you wanted extras they will gladly give you more. It's a lovely restaurant with great staff, pretty good food, but it's a tad noisy. I might drop by for a special occasion again.",4.0,5.0,53,2016-11-25,43.671049,-79.391714,French
Chabrol Restaurant,"The patio is very nice. It's nicely lit in the evening. Marble tables, herbs in planters. Very close attention to detail for the aesthetics of the patio. Service is friendly. The wine is good but seems to be priced a bit high for what you get. Lots of French options. The beer is good, too, and they have Belgian Trappist beers available. The food seems hit or miss. I liked the Papillote of Whitefish. The presentation was awesome--they open the bag and pour butter on it at the table. Solid dish. Unfortunately I can't say the same for the Braised Lamb with Fennel. The lamb wasn't what I expected for braised lamb--it seemed almost boiled. The flavours were somewhat bland and very mediocre compared to other lamb dishes I've had in Toronto and around the world. I definitely wouldn't come back for that. Overall, a pretty good spot. If I had ordered the fish instead of the lamb for myself I probably would've given it 5, but the lamb dish was disappointing. The decor is gorgeous, the service is friendly. The patio has a nice romantic feel and would be great for evening drinks or dinner.I would definitely come back and try other menu items.",4.0,4.0,53,2017-06-19,43.671049,-79.391714,French
Chabrol Restaurant,"Chabrol is a beautiful restaurant, chef Doug is such a wonderful chef and kind person! The food here is always incredible. The beauty of Chabrol is that the ingredients are such high quality and everything is cooked to bring out the natural flavors. I usually get the mushroom dish (which is vegan/vegetarian) or the Ttoro, both dishes are absolute must haves when you come to Chabrol. The restaurant is small, but it has an incredible patio for the summer. This place is pricey - but more than worth it, for special occasions this has to be one of my favorite places, the food, service and ambiance are all incredible.While my many experiences have been incredible, my one complaint would be for booking parties, I looked into renting the venue for a special occasion, which they were very helpful about. However to rent the venue there is a down payment of 5000$ - which does not include any of the food or the wine which we obviously would be getting. Although the establishment is in York ville, which is always going to be very expensive, a payment of 5000$ before food and drinks is a bit ridiculous. For a party it would roughly be around 15 000$.

Very nice of them. I know some places that would just downright refuse! Food:Pork Liver Mousse - I could see myself coming back here just to snack on this. Quantity and quality fit the price. Lentil Salad - This was delicious. Not sure how healthy it is in terms of a salad, but I would recommend it. Friends had: Ttoro - and loved it. Roasted squash salad - apparently it was only okay. Rabbit tartine - a good portion for a lunch or light dinnerApple tart - they liked it, I didn't.

Dagu Rice Noodle,We love Dagu! The decor is simple and comfortable. The staff is friendly and speedy too! What we love most is the price and what you get. We tried pretty much every single soup and they are all flavorful and packed with toppings. It's such a warm and fuzzy feeling to have a nice bowl of dagu noodles on a winter day.

Dagu Rice Noodle,"VENUE/AMBIANCE (5)Well-lit, modern restaurant with small tables and bar seating great for pairs and small groups. No dedicated parking - street parking and paid lots nearby. Clean and tidy when we arrived on a weeknight at 6:15 pm. SERVICE (4)Waiting for a table is somewhat a negative experience. It's been a cold winter and their lines often extend outside. However, the staff refuse to take group size or give out numbers to guests waiting in line outside of the restaurant. Only the few people who manage to squeeze into the small enclosure are given numbers. It's pretty inconvenient for larger groups. The waitress who served our table was great though - polite and friendly when she took our order and when she served our meal. FOOD (4)I ordered the Original Crossing the Bridge Rice Noodle (9.49). This includes 10 toppings, 3 slices of beef, unlimited noodles, and a boiling stone bowl of soup. Soup base was delicious - deep and flavorful but not salty. The bowl kept the soup hot,  through my first and even second bowl of noodle. There's enough toppings to accompany two bowls of noodles, but those with bigger appetites (or males) might want to order additional meat/protein. Noodles were chewy and well textured; they didn't get soggy while I ate. QUALITY/VALUE (4)For 9.49, this was reasonable for the location and amount of food served. Extra protein is 2.99, which makes the meal significantly more expensive. Other soup bases also cost a little more. For the original flavor, it's worth it. I'm not sure how much more I would pay to try other flavors. OVERALL 4 stars",3.0,4.0,57,2018-01-24,43.655398,-79.38429,"Chinese , Noodles"
Dagu Rice Noodle,"Tried this place for the first time as I LOVE NOODLES! I tried the cross bridge soup base as per other yelpers recommendations. Love the soup, love all the add ins that come with it. I ordered additional beef but didnt like how it came inside my clay pot so I felt like it was overcooked by the time I cooked my other ingredients. I was taking my time taking photos for my yelp reviews when the waitress told me to hurry up and put the ingredient in my soup or else it wouldnt cook in time which I thought was funny. I was convinced I would take up the offer the unlimited noodle refills but I didnt. I was too full even on my first meal. I love the experience, the amount of food (great value) and service was okay.We tried the fried durian dessert thing but I wasnt a fan of it.

Dagu Rice Noodle,"Overrated imo. The noodles were nice and chewy but altogether it just didn't feel hearty enough. I'd much rather prefer a bowl of ramen noods or a bowl at deer garden than here. The broth, while healthy, needed a lot of seasoning (felt like I was slurping noodles out of hot water lol). Yes, original crossing the bridge noodle is the one you wanna get if you like blogging or instagramming, but everything was underwhelming outside of presentation. Not to mention, I did not feel like I got my money's worth from such small topping portions. Don't think I would return on my own tbh. It IS unlimited noodle refill though, which is a plus if you're hungry I guess.

I ordered the traditional rice noodle (first on the menu) and it came with two good chunks of pork bone. The soup was MSG city, salty and full of MSG, but it did taste surprising good. Not a restaurant that claims to be MSG free, plus this is a Chinese noodle house, wasn't expecting it to be super healthy and organic. Extra noodles are free of charge. I had 2 full bowls of them, and it was pretty value for how much it cost.

Dagu Rice Noodle,"After discovering Yunan/Crossing Bridge Noodle Soup this year, I have been on a Chinese noodle exploration for the last 6 months.  I was thus highly anticipating the downtown opening of Dagu, a popular chain in China.  My boyfriend had visited the Markham branch and he had nothing but positive things to say about the food.  When we visited this downtown branch, my boyfriend concluded that it's almost as good as the branch up north.  The only real difference would be the quality of the sides, which are saltier and smaller in portion size at the downtown location compared to what you would find at the Markham one.  Fortunately, the flavour, content, and portion-size of the noodle soups are pretty much identical, so you're not losing much unless you really want to have sides on the periphery. We've been to Fudao, another popular vendor of Yunan/Crossing Bridge Noodle Soup.  Fudao pales in comparison to Dagu.  Fudao's noodles are so soft that they could feel soggy and their broths are bland, whereas Dagu's broths are rich in flavour and filled with chewy, firm noodles. The one trump card Fudao holds, however, is their price point.  Eating at Fudao will save you 2-3 dollars more, but remember it's at the cost of food quality.Pros:- Servers are fluent in English and Mandarin- Broths are rich in flavour- Wait times are minimal - Unlimited noodles - Noodles are firm and plentiful- Booths are spacious and you can easily fit 6 people in them- Clean- Noodle soups stay hot for an extremely long time - Walking distance from Eaton CentreCons:- Very little protein in the broths- Sides are saltier and small in portion size- Drinks are well over-priced- Stone bowls are 150 degrees celcius in temperature, so be mindful for children and company that is animated/clumsy- More expensive than other Crossing Bridge/Yunan Noodle Soup vendors",3.0,4.0,57,2017-12-08,43.655398,-79.38429,"Chinese , Noodles"
Dagu Rice Noodle,"We have been meaning to try out this new place for a while but each time we drove by there was a lineup outside so we would go to our usual favourite in the area, Sansotei. Today we got there early. Roughly 4:45. Still had to wait about ten minutes but inside. The guy at the door was very nice and gave us a menu to look at while we waited. The place is nice and bright and has a funky vibe. I did feel like I was in Melbourne's Asian restaurant heaven for a bit. The music is loud but not intrusive. And the whole place is buzzing with wait staff delivering hot bowls of goodness. We sat down and Cindy explained how the menu works. The top four soups are already filled with all of the ingredients and made when they come to you. The rest below you put in the ingredients yourself. We opted for the ready made ones and I had the pork bone while my wife had the fish one that they recommend.  Both were really good. Although a huge warning. And they warn you as well. THE BOWL IS CRAZY HOT!!!!!!!!!!Both of us had at least one touch of scalding on our hands so please be careful. We also had a tofu appetizer which was great. The noodles were good. Not my favourite but good. And the soups were very rich and not overly salty. And each had a quail egg, some ham like squares, cabbage, woodear mushrooms and corn pieces. I think I preferred my wife's choice. It actually reminded me of soups my aunt makes in Poland. A little sour but so rich and delicious and with a little heat.  So great on a cold day!  We really liked our food and will likely come back.

Dagu Rice Noodle,"3.5 StarsVisited ~7pm on Saturday right after Black Friday and stood in line for what seems like 30mins. It's definitely not worth the wait but overall was satisfied with our noodle soup and sides. The server was helpful w/ the menu, ""crossing bridge"" means the noodle and ingredients are separate from the soup and you add it all in yourself vs. the regular which has it all prepared inside. The waitress recommended tomato or the spicy sour crossing bridge noodle soup but she's from Szechuan so her taste profile may skew on the heavier spicier side. She also recommends adding shrimp which I say is not worth the effort since the shrimp isn't peeled! I actually enjoyed the simple broth from the braised pork bone instead since the delicate taste of braising the bones are more apparent, unlike the tomato version where the tomato overwhelms it. Ordered - w/ ** marked for recommendations - Signature Braised Bone in Pork Rice Noodle Soup  **Recommend over tomato version though very skimpy on the protein so you might want to add meat. The soup broth here really sets itself apart from other places. There's a reason why it's called signature! - Tomato Flavoured Crossing Bridge Noodle Soup with Beef Slices + added shrimp - Tomato kind of cover the taste of the braised broth and only ~3 pieces of shrimp are provided and needs to peeled - Deep fried Pumpkin w/ red bean paste - **Recommend chewy and absolutely delicious- Egg Tofu - Interesting texture reminds me of a mix of a mushroom and tofu with a vinegary sesame sauce- Deep fried Durian pastry - It's okay it doesn't seem like they added sugar as it's less sweet than I expected for dessert - Salty crispy chicken - Good no complaints here",3.0,3.0,57,2017-12-01,43.655398,-79.38429,"Chinese , Noodles"
Dagu Rice Noodle,"I'm a converted fan. The first time I tried their noodles, it was good but there wasn't a huge wow factor. I really didn't think I would come back but now, I find myself craving the warmth and comfort of their refreshing broth and noodles. It just really hits the spot for me without making me feel lethargic after a hot meal.I always get the signature pork bone soup - it's rich enough in flavour for me without being overly salty. The bowl comes out steaming hot but it doesn't retain heat so it's best to put the noodles in ASAP to cook it for a bit longer.I don't eat too much meat in my diet normally so the amount on the bone and other ingredients (ham, quail egg, bamboo shoots, red sausage, etc.) in the bowl was perfect for me. Though I can see how some people would not be satisfied with the amount of protein they provide. But honestly, how is that any different from other noodle places that give you two slices of beef for the same price? There's a reason why you can choose add-ons. Their sides are also amazing - I'd recommend the crispy chicken (a.k.a. popcorn chicken) and sliced beef and ox tongue in Szechuan chili sauce!If you're hesitant about the 3 star rating, keep in mind that for all Chinese restaurants on Yelp - that would be equivalent to 4 stars for the food if you ignore all the people bitching about the service. I haven't had a bad experience myself in the 4 times I've come here - quick to seat us, quick to take orders, quick to come out with food, and didn't take forever getting us the bill and change. They're a busy restaurant so yeah, it would take some effort to flag them down but I haven't seen any of the servers being rude to people.

Dagu Rice Noodle,"Despite hearing many people talk about the long lines, I didn't actually have to wait in line. I came maybe 30mins after they opened and not many people were there yet. That being said, it seemed I got in right before the lunch time rush (thank goodness). Poor server was running around to evey table , so I didn't blame her for not being overly friendly. I felt that she was quite efficient albeit a little aggressive when putting the dishes down on the table. That didn't really bother me at all though.Their menu consists of rice noodle soups. Being a noodle lover, that was the perfect thing for me. I got the spicy and sour crossing the bridge noodle soup. Tbh I was hesitant at first--it's always a hit or miss when it comes to sour soups but it tasted great! More on the sour side but not over the top.I think it would've been better if it was a littler spicier but I was overall satisfied with the taste. The dish comes with several toppings, and unless you want extra meat or something, it's fine as it is. You put the toppings in yourself, they come separate from the soup since they don't want to overcook it. The noodles were just the right texture for me (soft but very slightly chewy). AND YOU GET UNLIMITED NOODLE REFILLS. If you're like me, who doesn't drink much soup, adding extra noods in is a great bonus. Price-wise I do think it's fair. They give you a variety of toppings that stores normally don't give and the soup stays hot the whole time. Also very worth the money if you get additional noodle refills.

I know it's unlimited noodles but I felt satisfied with just one. My friend ordered the soup with mushroom. The menu called it crossing the bridge.

Dagu Rice Noodle,"When we got here, there was a short line outside the restaurant. Small rant: The system to seat people is quite inefficient. They only jot down your name and party size for groups that are in the indoor waiting area (fits about 6ppl). Anyone after that, they are not interested in your group size and you are to wait outside until there is few enough people before you so you fit that tiny space. So essentially if there is a party of 6 before you and lots of unconnected 2 people tables, you ain't getting seated as a party of 2. Nonetheless, we went early at 6, so the wait was only 15mins.Having been to similar noodle chains uptown, I was happy to see more soup base options at Dagu. They are priced ~$2 more than I'm used to, but could be just a dt price. Similar Yunan style noodle setup: You pick soup, comes with 10 raw misc. toppings you cook in the boiling soup. Noodle itself is bottomless.Food came within 5mins of ordering. I had the mushroom soup and I was very impressed. Mushrooms were fragrant, there was good quantity and variety (enoki, button mushrooms, ouster mushrooms etc). Toppings were basic hot pot offerings but the soup really elevated the whole experience.

Dagu Rice Noodle,"I find it strange - that the early Yelp reviews were so negative about Dagu and yet during dinnertime the line up to get in is over 25 person deep.   Trusting my eyes, I gave it a try. Food:Specializing in rice noodles, there is a choice of different soups along with additional items (like beef slices, lamb, shrimp, etc). I ordered the Tomato flavoured crossing the bridge noodles with extra slices of beef. All your ingredients are provided separately.  You then place it in a bowl of boiling tomato flavoured soup. The beauty of this place is that you control how cooked and the intensity of your soup flavouring. Tip: Don't just throw everything in at the same time. That is a rookie mistake!  Raw meat first (or later if you like it more Red), then cold meats, then sauce, then noodles, then preserved veggies. Lastly you put in any fresh veggies. This provides the proper texture - your soup noodle will turn out excellent!  Mine was tangy and the noodles were al dente. Decor: Fairly clean and comfortable. Place is still brand new. Service:  I was not expecting Ritz Carlton. Still I was pleasantly surprised that my servers were polite.  I asked for a water when I ordered and got it right away. Overall: the line up is justified. This is a good place for some unique tasting noodle soup in downtown Toronto. Another solid 4+. Tip#2: get there before 5pm.

FAT Lamb Kouzina,"Extraordinary.  I'm from Montreal and pretty much can't eat Greek food in Toronto overall.  I've had some that is half decent compared to Mtl Greek but haven't had a ""good"" meal out here.  Well last night I had a GREAT Greek meal out here!From great people who obviously love what they do.  Simple, fresh, homemade (tziziki and pita) and their lamb was noooooo f'n joke at ALL.  Some of the best lamb I've ever eaten anywhere and easily some of the best Greek food, and I'm tempted to say the best, that I've had in my life.  Top notch. I feel bad giving the review because I don't want them to change what they do at all and expansion sometimes does that.  But food this good deserves to be shared so I can't be a selfish a-hole about it.  Thus, the 5 star review.If you care about the care put into your food, then put this food into your mouth.If quality is important to you, then show yours - go to Fat Lamb Kouzina.If you're a foodie, (you can even ask Judy) eating here is your duty.Now.... do you see?Great staff, food, and atmosphere.  Small, cozy, and super real.  Super, natural, maybe supernatural.I got so sidetracked by the food I forgot to mention how engaging the staff are.  Really good guys who really love what they do.  This is a passion for them and it shows.",4.0,5.0,50,2018-01-12,43.672551,-79.387868,"Greek , Cooking Classes , Caterers"

The pita was delicious and I had to have the gyro over 2 days as it was FILLED with lamb. FAT Lamb, never stop being you. The place is clean and family run.

We planned to eat in and I didn't think I would finish my gyro so I got it to go. Wow was I wrong.. I finished the whole thing. Everything was delicious and very fresh tasting.

FAT Lamb Kouzina,"When you go to a place named Fat Lamb Kouzina, it's only appropriate to order lamb, right? I love lamb and I love gyros but I didn't see it on the menu. No problem, my server said I could get that but they only serve gyros on a pita. Hmmm, I didn't want a sandwich. No problem, I could get lamb gyros with potatoes, and a salad. Yay!I paid for my food and sat at one of three window seats looking out onto Yonge Street. They only have one table, a rather large one, with shared seating. The smell of the food was making me hungrier.A young lady brought my order to me. Hmmm, two (takeout) boxes? Okay, everything is served in takeout boxes but I'm still a bit puzzled. One box had lamb with potatoes and tzatziki and the other box had lamb with salad and tzatziki. Did I order two dishes? Is that why it cost $19?The salad was very good, well dressed and tasty. I was, however, a bit disappointed with the lamb and tzatziki. I found them both to be lacking flavour. The lamb needed more seasoning and the tzatziki needed more garlic.Darn, I really wanted to like this place with its cool name.",4.0,3.0,50,2017-08-04,43.672551,-79.387868,"Greek , Cooking Classes , Caterers"
FAT Lamb Kouzina,"I had been passing this little restaurant for a month before I decided to check it out. After the gym one afternoon I decided to order take out and eat it at home. My order included a pork wrap, and a slice of cheese pie. As I always do, I asked for no onions for the wrap, and had to wait for the pie because they were sold out. They were sold out of a lot of things at 2:30pm on a Saturday. Once ready, my food was packaged in a brown paper bag which turned out to be a bad idea. Once I got home - 20 minutes away, the juice in the wrap had leaked through the bag on to my pants, the wrap was soggy, there were onions in my wrap and the $7 cheese pie was pretty small and not filling. In sum, I had to throw out the wrap because I can't eat onions, the pie was overpriced for what you got, and the packaging resulted in a soggy mess. My advice: stay in rather than get it to go, and check your order carefully (if asked to omit an ingredient) before taking a bite or taking it to go. Cost:Slice of cheese pie $7Wrap $12P.S. Cash and credit only and they are only open on weekdays and Saturdays during the day.

FAT Lamb Kouzina,"I'M STILL SALIVATING JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW FANTASTIC THIS MEAL WAS.Having opened just about 8 weeks ago, this cute little home-run restaurant is located conveniently along Yonge street within the Yorkville neighbourhood.I came with a few friends and inquired about which menu item was the best seller. I was informed it was the Pork Gyro so I ordered one and MY OH MY, DID IT NOT DISAPPOINT. When it arrived, it was picture perfect and accordingly so, it tasted absolutely delicious. In fact, this was by far THE most delicious gyro I've ever had - succulent, flavourful pulled pork atop an amazingly crisp yet fluffy pita, paired with fresh tomatoes, onions, dill, and sour cream. YUM! The total was $12, which is more expensive than what regular restaurants would charge but it was 100% well-spent. They were fairly generous with the pork and it was overall a filling portion.

FAT Lamb Kouzina,"This fine establishment is proof that yelp works, well for me anyways. If it had not been for my fellow yelp community, shout out to dilys ,I'm embarrassed to say I never would have tried this place, or probably even hear about it. How fortunate I was to be a yelper after eating here. My first impression of the restaurant was a little negative,if I'm being honest. I'm so used to getting rice served with everything that at first when I was told the lamb and potatoes isn't served on a bed of rice, I was pretty disappointed. That disappointed dissipated with the first bite of that tender lamb. It was literally cooked to perfection. I have never tasted meat, lamb meat none the less, that was so moist and full of flavour, that didn't cost 100$. Lamb has a tendency of being dry and has that gamey taste; NOT HERE. I'm still in shock at how amazing this meal was. Potatoes are pleasantly flavoured and paired with a hearty amount of homemade tzatziki sauce. For only 2$ more I got a house made pita bread, which yes you guessed it, was also incredible. I'm seriously looking forward to coming back here again, maybe try the moussaka.

FAT Lamb Kouzina,"First off, the flavours... Divine!  The food was tasty, well-seasoned, and just plain delicious.  They've truly put in a lot of effort into perfecting their dishes.  Service was lovely. Welcoming and grateful.  You could tell the customers are top priority.  So why not five stars?  The portion sizes seemed kind of small for the price you pay.  I had a lamb special served in a small-ish box for $15.  There was tender and flavourful lamb, a few potato wedges, and a dollop of tzatziki.  If the prices were brought down by about 10-15%, it would seem more reasonable for the amount of food currently being served. Otherwise, add more potatoes.  Put in a little salad.  Give a bit more to bulk up the serving.  Perhaps if the food was served in a different container, the presentation of quantity might be perceived differently as well.  I'm just offering some constructive feedback, that's all.  I would like to emphasize the owners seem like lovely people who are cooking with heart and soul.

FAT Lamb Kouzina,"Tip:  If possible, try to come earlier on in the day as they run out of items.I came an hour before closing and there were only gyros (lamb or beef) and salad left.  And there was a line-up!  Pitas, as per review and website, were definitely homemade, so that definitely sets Fat Lamb apart from other pita competitors.I must mention that this place is not a cheapie place.  They had run out of pork gyro, so offered lamb ($15) at the entree price, but replaced the orzo with pita.  Lamb was very tender and filling.  Pork/beef gyros are $12.  Granted, lamb is a more expensive meat and there was a good amount of it.  So just brace yourself if you think it's going to be quick-pita pit type pricing.Village Salad was $12, looked gorgeous with all the colours, rip tomatoes were bright red, but it came in smallish-square takeout box.There is a bit of a wait for the food which is home cooking, but expect sitdown prices.  There is bar seating at the window (3 seats) + at the order counter (3 seats) + a large table in the centre, which half of it is unusable because patrons would be lining up on the other side.",4.0,4.0,50,2017-05-28,43.672551,-79.387868,"Greek , Cooking Classes , Caterers"

FAT Lamb Kouzina,Fat Lamb Kouzina is an awesome neighborhood spot in Yorkville to grab a quick bite!They are only open for lunch at the moment and close down around 5pm. I got pulled pork wrapped in pita bread and it was so good!The portion was pretty big and there's a generous amount of pork wrapped up in the fluffy homemade pita bread. It's definitely comfort food with oil dripping through the wrap. But that's what made it so delicious! The owner was telling us about how they travelled through Greece to cook with the grandmas.

FAT Lamb Kouzina,I finally got to try Fat Lamb Kouzina this week for lunch.  It's located just south of Davenport on Yonge. It's a quick 2 minute walk from Yonge and Bloor Subway Station. It's a great small space that puts out amazing food. There is some window seats to people watch while you have lunch and there is also a communal table in the middle of the restaurant. I have read a lot of amazing things about this restaurant. They are all TRUE!  They blew me away with the quality of their food. I love Lamb so I went with the Herb Roasted Lamb with Roast Potato and Tzatziki. I decided to grab a homemade pita bread to go with my lunch. I always need some pita when I have Tzatziki! My mouth is watering thinking about this lunch. The lamb was cooked to perfection! It was very tender melt in your mouth. It was moist and juicy. Perfection! The roast potatoes are perfectly done.  The Tzatziki on top is a generous portion.  This food is cooked like you would at home. It's was if my mom had made this dish. They really strive on making the food just as they would at home. You can really tell that they take the time to make sure everything is top notch and cooked to perfection. I cannot say enough good things about Fat Lamb Kouzina. I will definitely be back.

La Bella Managua,"A solid 4*s.  Knocked off a star for food taking approx. 30mins to arrive to table after ordering.Arrived just before 3pm, ordered within 5-10mins, drinks came 15mins after that (yes, including water), and food came within the 30min mark of ordering.  I think this is a tad too long to wait.  Water should've arrived shortly after ordering, not 15mins after that.Other than food taking its time to arrive to the table, servers did check-in with our table at least 3Xs.  So that is a good sign!We ordered their version of Mojito ($8.50), ""Tacos"", & Pollo a la Parillia.  Mojito was pretty good, although it wasn't as alcohol-y, but with more fizz - Club Soda, I think.  Still, I think this would be refreshing especially when the weather gets warmer!""Tacos"" ($10) - Think taquitos, without cheese, then a coleslaw with some sour cream and ketchup zigzagged all over the dish.  They could've done without the ketchup as the coleslaw was already sour.  This dish was good, but again, not what I expected when I read ""tacos"".Pollo a la Parillia (~$16) - basically 2 flat pieces of grilled chicken over rice and peas, some pieces of plantains, with a tomato/avo/sweet pepper salad.  Portions of the rice + salad were generous.  The chicken pieces were thin and on the smaller side.  Dish was good for 1.5 person.  ***Entrées, imo, were totally shareable esp. IF you also order an app.  On its own, you still maybe a bit hungry afterwards.***Most of the patrons appeared to be Spanish speaking, so that gives me an indication that the spot is pretty authentic.  Not a cheapie spot though, expect to spend ~$15-20pp, without any alcoholic drinks.I'd go back, but NOT on an empty stomach!!!",4.0,4.0,163,2018-01-28,43.662231,-79.42499,"Latin American , Nicaraguan"

We ordered the drinks, ceviche, and for the mains had the rack of lamb, camarones (tiger shrimp) and a vegetarian platter. The food came out in good time. To start of, the drinks were very delicious, but the ceviche was not the best I have had. There wasn't much fish in it. I had the lamb and it was cooked perfectly and the gravy was great. My friends had the tiger shrimp and the bandeja tipica (with fried cheese) and they seemed to like their meals as well.

La Bella Managua,"Attitude does not make for a successful business. I have previously dined here before and even brought friends to celebrate my birthday there. However, on this particular day I decided to bring in another person to show them what the culture was all about. We walked in. No one greeted us and we decided to sit down. There was a group of young kids there ( guessing college students). I realized after awhile that the girl at that table full of students was the daughter of one of the waitresses. And so she had brought her friends to chill there during a weekday early afternoon. What bothered me about this wasn't that they were young kids but that they made it a point to listen into my conversation in another language and talk about it to each other. The second they noticed that I was aware they turned completely red and were embarrassed. So if you are going to allow your daughter to chill at your work establishment with her friends, make sure they respect the actual paying patrons that are sharing that space and not snickering about others in a rude manner. Back to the waitress. She took our order and since we were the only ones there I figured it wouldn't take long. Well I was wrong it did take long and we had to keep looking up to see if they forgot about us.  Well the food finally arrived. I ordered the carne asada and the other plate ordered was the catch of the day red snapper. Well as we ate it I noticed that my meat was on the hard side. And the red snapper was very dry even for a fried fish. When the waitress came over to see how our food was we told her the red snapper was too dry.Well it seemed like the waitress was offended by it and said "" what do you mean it's dry ? It's fried fish, that's how it is"". Believe me we order fried fish in several restaurants and it's not dry inside. So the waitress disagreed and left us. She could have at least acknowledged our comment and taken it as a constructive criticism. But instead she left rudely. I think she was so offended that she told another waitress to finish with us while she sat at a table near the back and sulked. The waitress took forever to get us our bill and instead of asking if she will be needing to bring the debit machine she left us for another 5-7 min waiting. So we looked around and raised our hand to the ex waitress of ours who was still just sitting there and she rudely says loudly "" yah! She's coming!""  at which the other waitress realized she was supposed to come to us. When the ex waitress did this there was another man who also worked there sitting at another table and I clearly heard him say in another language ""do they understand ?"" Because he clearly wanted to say something in Spanish but she told him we did understand so he remained silent. Our replacement waitress did not smile, barely spoke and was worse than a robot. This rude attitude was uncalled for and has tarnished all my other experiences of this place. But when I think about it, the service was never stellar to begin with, I just like places that remind me of Latin America. We were not being rude about the fish being dry. If you ask us how our meal is and we are paying, we will be honest. I didn't even get to say how dry my meat was.   Imagine how she would of been if I had told her that ? .... Needless to say do not come here expecting super friendly smiles and interactions. Just come here if you want to experience some sort of Latin American food with sour faces. It's unfortunate that I had to write this review but I only give one star to places that lack in personal customer service skills. Even if they had been super friendly but the food was terrible would they have received at least a three star.

I ordered the carne asada which was $14.50 and could have easily fed two people (or half could have been packed up for lunch the next day). As it was, it was too delicious so I ate it all! The steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned to a drool-worthy level. The meal also came with a coleslaw type salad, rice, slices of avocado, beans, and a choice of sweetened or green plantain. I also ordered the national drink of Nicaragua which I thought was a nice item to have on the menu for people curious about the culture and its cuisine. It was very sour at first, but once I got used to it, I liked it. The service was courteous, though a little slow and they don't check up on you often. Sometimes this is nice though! They were not snooty when members of the group couldn't pronounce some of the names of the dishes. The restaurant is on the small side, but there were plenty of empty tables when I arrived at around 6 pm on a weeknight. The spot grew busier as we were there, so I got the impression that it's a well-known and well-liked spot. By the time we left, multiple groups were waiting for tables. The music was pleasant, appropriate to the setting, and not too loud. The ambiance is casual/cozy/homey, and a good spot for dinner on a winter night, but try not to sit too close to the door as when it opens you get a cold blast. Would definitely recommend this restaurant. It was a great introduction to Nicaraguan cuisine!",4.0,4.0,163,2017-12-19,43.662231,-79.42499,"Latin American , Nicaraguan"

The service was nice and friendly, especially if you speak Spanish. I had the fish of the day, Haddock served with plantains, rice and a avocado, pepper salad. I found the whole thing to be fresh, tasty and it gave me a great experience of authentic Nicaraguan cuisine. The dinning room was extremely hot though, and they weren't coming often to fill out our drinks and water glasses.

La Bella Managua,"Where do I begin... The moment my friends and I sat down we were asked, ""so boys and girls, did you guys just finish your last day of school?"" We genuinely thought she was joking until she went on about it. It was definitely not a professional way to treat your clientele, even if we age well for our age.  When we ordered, I clearly ordered the roasted chicken but when the orders came she claimed that I ordered the other chicken dish. I wouldn't be as upset if she kept insisting I ordered the chicken dish and kept redirecting the blame to my colleague beside me when I pointed to what I wanted and read the dish name TWO TIMES IN BOTH LANGUAGES ON THE MENU. The staff offered a very low level of integrity throughout the service. After we all paid (with the 15% tip they slap on top), they were badgering us and harassing us about whether we paid or not. The chicken dish that I accepted in the end was okay. However my friends who ordered the boneless steak dish found their meat to tough, dry and rather bland. The ceviche was okay but definitely not noteworthy for the price you pay for it. If this is how they want to treat young professionals, I say go for it and we will take our buisness elsewhere while you wait on your baby boomers to die off. Considering the substandard quality of food and God awful service, I definitely would not recommend this restaurant to ANYONE despite the good reviews.

La Bella Managua,"Had this place bookmarked for months and I was finally able to visit!I absolutely loved it!  I ordered the fish of the day which was the red snapper and it was just cooked perfectly.  It went great with the rice, fried plantains and avocado.  It was just so refreshing and felt very home-y.  Their empanadas are delish as well, crispy on the outside and cheesy on the inside mmmm!I've never tried Nicaraguan food before and this place definitely made me fall in love with it. When I come back (which I definitely will) I would love to try their Carne Asada, and their tacos as it looked mouth watering when I saw other people ordering it.  The only downfall was our first server, as she was very dry, didn't seem friendly and gave the impression she did not want to be there.  We asked her for suggestions as to what we should get as it was our first time and she just gave us a dry and quick response.  She basically just wanted to get our order and gtfo lol.  Halfway through our dinner we did get another server who was super friendly and accomodating, thank goodness!I will still give this place a 5 star as the food overtook that one server's bitterness and everyone else working there was super friendly!Thank you La Bella Managua for feeding me my first Nicaraguan food and making me love it!",4.0,5.0,163,2017-05-24,43.662231,-79.42499,"Latin American , Nicaraguan"

My boyfriend and I ordered the mix ceviche (shrimp & fish), and he had carne asada while I had the pez dorado. My dish was mahi mahi? fish and it was perfect texture! Soft, melting in your mouth kind of fish while the ceviche was rich, citrusy and so greatness! I think my favorite part of this restaurant was the quality of food, the portion size, for such a reasonable price. I mean granted mine was half salad, but it was FILLING. I mean REALLY filling. You definitely get your money's worth. Service was decent, and for a Tuesday night, it was semi full house. Always a good sign. Highly recommend ordering the ceviche mixed, and the pez dorado dish.

The Good Son,"Color me impressed when you can make reservations for brunch. Although an asterisk should be denoted as they only serve brunch on Sundays (which I discovered when arriving on a Saturday without a reservation the first time I attempted to come here).That said, I was quite pleased with the experience when I made it in the doors.Damn fine chicken and waffles on their menu grabbed my attention. 3 pieces of chicken (1 thigh, 2 drumsticks if memory serves correct) on 2 pieces of waffle (aka half of a large waffle) with some syrup and a berry compote of sorts in the mix. I could've licked the plate clean it.Everything got good reviews, and from creeping on other tables meals I'll say the breakfast pizza and the Filipino breakfast options both looked quite good while unique.Drink selection was a bit less impressive, including $12 caesars and an unimpressive but adequate tap beer selections. On an atmosphere topic, I'll say that I like how the place has a darkness to the room, as since the ceilings are so tall here is actually keeps the place feeling cozy.

The lighting is a bit dim but it definitely sets the mood for a quiet date night.The service was excellent, as our waiter immediately greeted us and took our drink orders. There was two of us and since we weren't that hungry we decided to share a Wood-Oven pizza (proscuitto). Do not underestimate the size of the pizza for the price. It is a very large pizza. The crust was aromatic and just the right amount of dough. The toppings complimented each other well, I mean how can you go wrong with prosciutto and arugula, classic. We didn't end up finishing it, only because we were stuffed!

The Moana Loa is delicious.2. In addition to pizza, they do comfort food such as a jerk shrimp appetizer, steak frites, steak tartare, burgers, salads, etc. This is the place to come with a group when you are not sure how to please everyone. 3. The place has a fun/strange vibe (lots of 100 year old photos all over the walls) that attracts a youthful crowd from Liberty Village and other nearby neighbourhoods.4. The restaurant is loud.

The Good Son,"This is such a hard review to do... I want to give it a 4 star but comparing it to Sabai Sabai, L'Unita, and Gusto 101 (which I gave 4 stars each), The Good Son doesn't quite match up.  It's close but too many small quirks just made it less welcoming and great for me to come back.I booked on opentable and once arriving into the lobby area, the hostess was quick to recognize us and put us at a table.  I really think it was smart of them to have an actual lobby area and another door for the dining area in Canada.  Not only does this block out the bitter cold wind (never felt it once), it actually keeps the dining space a very nice vibe without having standing and waiting people stare at you while enjoying dinner.  This little thing definitely made me hopeful for a great night... small details make the difference between a great 4 star and an amazing 5 star.  The restaurant itself is impressive.  Open and incredibly intricate fun details... the wall of mirrors on one and clocks on the other.  The beautiful chandeliers... the stacks of impressive bottles in the bar area and the open kitchen with the wood burning stove for their pizzas.  Just give yourself a minute to take it all in... it's a great setting for a night out.The atmosphere is buzzing cause the music is just a little loud where you do have to speak over it. It's dark with candles. It would be romantic except for the constant music and louder tables who are trying to have a conversation.   So more of a fun vibe.  The tables along the wall are mostly for 4 + people and if you're a party of two... you're mostly stuck with these odds and ends in the middle where you do get bumped a lot.  We were first given the most awkward table in the place... first table in front of the lobby door and out in the open.  Uh no thanks.  We watched as the hostess tried to give that table to a few other people... each saying no.  Funny thing ... seeing there was many other 2 tops empty in the place.As for the service, this is where the first little misstep starting to happen... our waiter was a bit of a sarcastic jerk.  I'm not sure if he was having an off day or he thinks sarcasm is a great way for ""humourous"" service but it just didn't go over well.  Comparing this to the Michelin Bib Gourmands in Chicago, Gusto or Sabai Sabai in Toronto... this was a definite service gap.  Other places had funny but also welcoming staff.  Half the time we'd actually wonder... did he think he was funny or was he being an ass?  Seeing how he wasn't really smiling with us... I think ass.  Maybe it's cause we didnt order any alcohol... not sure.  Either way, he wasn't welcoming and seeing him laugh and joke around at the bar with his colleagues, it made me realize this was going to be an interesting night.The other misstep was the food... don't get me wrong, some of it tasted very good.  We got the prosciutto pizza, sambal brussels, scallops, and PB gelato.  There was just something amiss with each except for the pizza.  The pizza was freshly made and served quickly... the pizza had a nice leopard spot to it.  It's thin crust and had a lot of prosciutto on top.  It's slightly more expensive than Librettos but it is somewhat close to it.  The brussels was nicely made ... crispy on the outside but still tender to bite through.  The sauce was interesting... though someone did say it was salty.  And when you get the bottom, oh god, VERY salty.  Maybe they just need to do more tossing so it coats the sprouts more and leave the sauce out of the dish.  The scallops was probably the biggest disappointment... it's under the main section for $25.  I would say the cook who did it... did a great job cooking them.  What was disappointing was that it was 2 scallops the size of twoonies and minimal amount of sides.  Maybe going to Sabai Sabai and Gusto skewed my version of main.  Other places didn't have large portions but still enough to be a main.  I think if they put the scallops under apps, it'd be more suitable and forgiving.  Thank god we ordered the sprouts or I'd be starving.  Between the poor service and questionable value of food and some unbalanced flavours, I dont think it was at the same level as some other good fun and hip places in Toronto. It's too bad cause there are some great things here... it's just not consistent or good enough to be a 4 star.",4.0,3.0,129,2017-03-21,43.643447,-79.422665,Canadian (New)
The Good Son,"Came here for brunch over the weekend with a group of 5 friends since other reviews had mentioned the good food. Reservations were made ahead of time and our table was a booth which was nice. A few members of the party were late and we trickled in slowly. From the very beginning we experienced poor customer service. Waiter did not introduce himself nor did he inquire what we wanted to drink. It was like he was giving us attitude and service was just awkward. It felt like he didn't want to serve our table at all. The food was delicious, our party ordered the eggs benny, chicken and waffles, and the french toast. All were delicious. However, the service was lacking. Even though we liked the food it is a shame because customer service is also a huge part of the dining experience.

The Good Son,"My fiance and I came for date night and we made reservations in advance. Overall I would say the experience was good, service was good, but food was just ok. We went in expecting some pretty damn good food, and as you'll see, not consistent enough to get the 4 or above stars. Steak tartar: as many mention, this will blow you away. Definitely one of the bests in the city. They start with a incredibly well seasoned, mixed, and perfectly textured steak tartar mix. On top, there's a raw quail egg, which when mixed with the tartar, gives even better texture and more depth and flavour. The finishing touch that makes this dish awesome is the toast. The toast is done in their wood oven and gives it this smoky flavour that pairs perfectly with the tartar. Jerk shrimp: would skip this. We ordered based on recos and reviews, but it certainly did not live up to our expectations. They come as 3 shrimp on top of a mango salad, we added a 4th for $5 more. Overall the shrimp were not very flavourful. They were wrapped in a potato string covering but they really lacked any sort of seasoning, and should definitely not be called 'jerk'. Either rename or re-season. Bulgogi short ribs with kimchi fried rice: as some mention below, the rice is bomb. Delicious and totally the star of the dish. However, the ribs left much to be desired. They were sliced ribs (not your rack-style) and were way overcooked to the point of dryness. The marinade was nice and balanced between sweet, salty and sticky, but the dryness of the ribs killed the dish.Octopus and fingerling potatoes: we've had lots of octopus in many different places and countries. This was good but could be better. Portion size was amazing, you get a whole tentacle for a good price, but the thicker parts of the tentacle became somewhat tough. The tip of the tentacle was the best, seasoning was good, but again, the thicker parts of the tentacle were less seasoned relative to the amount of meat. Very filling dish though and you definitely get your moneys worth of octopus! We didn't end up getting dessert as we were completely stuffed. Overall dishes were very satisfying, but there was definitely something missing from most of the food that could otherwise make this restaurant a home run.",4.0,3.0,129,2017-03-11,43.643447,-79.422665,Canadian (New)
The Good Son,"The Good Son is one of those restaurants I'd been wanting to try, so when a friend suggested going there for dinner, I jumped at the chance.I don't usually talk about the ambiance at a restaurant, but I have to admit the appearance of The Good Son's interior is pretty impressive (and jaw-dropping, frankly). High walls covered in paintings and an eclectic layout, The Good Son is certainly one of Toronto's more unique-looking eateries.But onto the food. We decided to start with the Steak Tartare (""Soft-Boiled Quail Egg, Grilled Sourdough"") and I have to admit, this was one of the best versions of this venerable dish I've ever had. The meat was mixed with perfect seasonings and flavors, while the tiny quail egg sitting atop the tartare was an ideal accompaniment. Seriously tasty.For my main, I went with the Mauna Loa Pizza (""Smoked Pork Cheek, Compressed Pineapple, Habaneros"") and again, this was delicious. The smoked pork cheek was amazingly addictive, while the other toppings were perfectly utilized and spaced out. (Seriously, this is a problem with a lot of pizzas. The toppings have to be evenly placed!)I was too full for dessert, but I certainly look forward to returning and sampling their sweet wares.",4.0,5.0,129,2017-02-01,43.643447,-79.422665,Canadian (New)

I was hoping for more meat. I then ordered their cod as it was their fish of the day and it was seared nicely. Their fennel salad was dressed lightly and their potatoes crispy.

The Good Son,"Came here last night with a group of 16 for a birthday celebration. We were told we only have an option to do a set menu that was served ""family style"". 7 of us arrived about 50 minutes late (the birthday girl has an indoor cat that got away outside, we had to find it). They skipped our first courses, we had to ask for it to be brought out. They brought us 1 pizza, which was pretty good, but it was to be shared between the 7 of us. The portion sizes were tiny. 2 regular plates of pasta to be shared between 7 people. The server told us he couldn't bring more as he ""already brought all he has for us out."" So my question is, if you see half the table is missing, why did you bring out ""all you had"" to serve? He also had a terrible attitude. In the end he comped the birthday girls meal, which was the least he could do since she literally ate nothing. He got upset with us because we ordered a bottle of wine and rather then asking who should be charged for it and splitting it he slapped it on my friends bill.

They had a nice (but small) beer selection I tap - but more interestingly had a couple of house cocktails which where pre-mixed and stored in small barrels to let it rest - kind of a nice touch. For the meal I went with what seems to be one of the more popular item (that's not a pizza that is) the short ribs with kim che rice. Although everything was expertly seasoned and the quail egg on top was perfectly cooked, I must've met that I was slightly disappointed with the cut quality of the short ribs - it was quite a lot and ends and silver skin to deal with.

Plenty of choices and lots of quantity. Started off with a Manhattan made with Basil Hayden's bourbon. It was well made and tasted very good.  Appy was the Charcuterie   Board. Very nice selection served with Crostini. 1st course was Mushroom Arancini ..nice and soft with a nice sweet sauce. 2nd up was a terrine served with pickled vegetables..firm but very tasty..could of had a little spice to it though. 3rd. Kale and quinoa salad ..never thought i would like  kale but it was oddly good..the dressing was nice and not too overpowering. 4th..The best part of the meal in my opinion was the Lamb shoulder pasta. It was served in a light cream sauce and had lots of flavour. The lamb shoulder was cooked to perfection and TBH, i could have had a full size portion and been happy..5th..Grilled pork chop served with grilled veggies..Nice and delicate and was lightly breaded. dessert was the Chocolate tort. Overall it was a great meal and the service was above the best. I would recommend sitting in the back dining room as the front one was a little loud with large parties.

Reminds me of space in Brooklyn called, Egg.I went with the daily frittata special of cauliflower, zucchini and bomba chili. It was spongy, yet solid. Great spring to this. It was a flavourful yet delicate combination. The chili was not noticeable - I was kinda hoping it would be. The mixed greens with balsamic vinegar dressing complimented it well but it wasn't say spectular.  I also ordered their house made sausage which disappointed me greatly because it was a patty instead. Maybe they ran out of casing? I wish I had known it before hand. I would have probably ordered the house made bacon instead.However, my friend ordered the S+B burger made with spicy aioli, bacon, fried egg, caramelized onion, cheddar and house made pickles plus a side of the most amazing crispy potatoes.  Loved this dish.....really wished I ordered this instead.  I can't say i would come here again for brunch but I'm curious about dinner.",4.0,4.0,166,2017-09-17,43.66142,-79.339734,"Bars , Canadian (New)"

Skin+Bones,"It's a sunny Saturday morning and everyone is out lining up at their favourite brunch resto in Leslieville.  Skin and Bones wasn't our plan A, in fact, it wasn't even our Plan B!  We ended up here because our top choices had line ups that looks like a min hr wait so Skin and Bones was a no brainer. I bookmarked skin and Bones for dinner so i was happy to give their brunch a try. The ambience is good, very spacious with modern, clean decor. The prices are very fair, ranging $13 - $16 and you will see the usually breakfast suspects like egg Benny and fried chicken with waffle. I ordered the mushroom on toast with poach eggs and the Mr. got the breakfast special. My poached eggs were way over cooked but they replaced it right away, so that wasn't a problem. The only other complaint I have is my salad were drenched in dressing.

Skin+Bones,"Very unimpressed with this restaurant. I have heard this restaurant had a Sunday special for oysters so I decided to try it. I made a reservation for 5 people prior to coming here. When arriving they couldn't find our reservation in the system so they sat us at the bar while the host and the manager sort out stuff. Luckily enough, one person from our group couldn't come, so they had a table that was available. The catch was they had a reservation for that table in a hour and was expected to finish at that time. Was kinda turned off by this. After being seated, the waitress told us the specials they had. We were were only allowed to order a maximum of 12 oysters per person. This was kind of disappointing because we only came here for the oysters. We then ordered the maximum allotment. The oysters were really good and was very impressed with the sauce that came with it. After finishing our meal, the manager asked us how our meal was and asked if we wanted anything else. We said no and asked for the bill. He was slightly disappointed and made alot of passive aggressive remarks to us. After my group paid and was leaving the waitress said ""see you next week, probably not tho."" Which was very rude. It was the worst restaurant experience I had in a while. **Note to management - If messing up a reservation, act professional and own up to your mistake. Not throw them at a random table and rush them. Also expect customers  to order from daily specials on the menu and if they don't order anything else don't act rude towards them. You and your staffs snobby, pretentious attitude is unessacary and very unwelcoming.

We were all left hungry and pretty much spent 70% of the time complaining about the the food, the quantity and the service we received.

Lasa by Lamesa,"Decided to go here because I was craving Filipino food plus I wanted to let my friend try this cuisine since she hsd never had it before. The decor was really simple yet romantic and cozy. Everything here is self-serve which is a nice touch from the usual wait staff. We were not disappointed in the price and taste and the portions were big enough to share. It honestly tasted home cooked. Here's a list of what we got:Lumpia shanghai (pork springrolls) - came with 6 rolls and they were fresh and the dipping sauce really pulled together the savoury flavour of the dishCombo meal with pork skewers - amazing flavours! There were 2 skewers and the pork was well done - cooked but not dry, it was still tender and juicy. And everything went to well together. This dish csme with salad, 2 eggs, and garlic rice. I thought the rice was a bit dry for my likingAdobo chicken - came with 4 pieces of chicken. The sauce was a bit salty but it went well with the rice that we had already. The chicken was tender and there was flavour in every bite. I liked the fact that they had pieces of red chilli which gave it a nice kick.Ube flan - thicker than flan consistency but the ube flavour really pulled through. The purple colour really stood out on its own but when it was served with crunchy granola it was really eye popping!

Lasa by Lamesa,"This restaurant is a new venture of the hip Filipino restaurant Lamesa. Different from the Lamesa, at this spot you would seat yourself and order at the counter. Water and utensils are both self-served. Kind of like Wvrst and Wilbur Mexicana on King Street. The decor inside was  modern with traditional Filipino elements, accented with bold colours. We ordered a Filipino Fried Chicken, a Oxtail Stew and an Eggplant side dish. The food came out pretty quickly. The Fried Chicken was definitely the highlight. The skin was crispy and flavourful, and meat is tender and juicy. One of the best I've ever had! The Oxtail Stew was intended for 2 people. You can tell they removed extra fat on the tail, which was good. It was flavourful but the dish seemed a bit under seasoned. The vegetables in the stew could also be cooked for a bit longer to my taste. Also for $18, the stew doesn't come with any side dishes or even rice, that's kind of surprising. We had to order a side of rice. The grilled eggplant was tasty, but for $7 it's a bit pricy. It's tiny. Overall, I think the flavour was good but the price we pay (especially considering it's self-served and it's not in the downtown core but on St Clair) is a bit too high. We ended up spending $45 after tax for two people. We would be happier if it's around $30 for we got. P.S. we went in on a cold winter day (0 degree), the restaurant was a bit freezing.

Lasa by Lamesa,"A pretty tasty place overall despite my limited experience eating Filipino food. We ordered the grilled chicken, milkfish, crispy pork belly, vegetable spring rolls, with a side of garlic rice. Nearly every dish was served with what seems to be pickled radishes and carrots that had a slightly sweet flavour. The grilled chicken was really flavourful and succulent, glazed with just enough sauce to coat bites of rice when eaten together. The sauce had a slightly spicy aromstic taste with hints of citrus highlights. The milkfish was lightly crispy on the outside although a bit dry on the inside, but was flavourful on it's own with no complex sauces needed. The pork belly skin was the most crispy and hard thing I've ever eaten in my life, a little too much for me even. My teeth felt uneasy as I bit down on the crispy skin side, however the lean and fatty layers below were fine. Near the other end of the slice towards the end of the lean layers, it is as also a little too dry as the entire pork belly piece seemed to be fried in oil. The spring rolls we're crispy, light, and flavourful, it wasn't too oily for something that's entirely deep fried. It came with its own sweet and sour dipping sauce which I used to pair with the pork belly as well given it's dryness. Although the place is partially self serve, where you go to a side table for your own utensils, plates, and other fixins, the staff at the counter in the front where you go to order your food seemed very friendly and enthusiastic.

Lasa by Lamesa,"I came by here for a mini-birthday celebration. It is a nice small restaurant with limited seating (maybe no more than 30 seats in total). You walk-in and order your food off their menu. They have shareable dishes or set meal dishes.I ordered the Siglog Plate - with BBQ Skewers, Garlic Fried Rice topped with two sunny side eggs and a side salad and papaya salad ($12). I also ordered the fresh lumpia ($6) (it is a ube crepe wrapped with vegetables topped with plum sauce).I love Filipino food and this place is on my 'love' list. The garlic rice was nice and crunchy but not too overpowering, the skewers were juicy and marinated to perfection. Sometimes I find the BBQ skewers at other places over burnt or too sweet but this version had a nice balance of sweetness. The salad had a citrus dressing and the papaya salad was sweet and sour at the same time. The fresh lumpia was good but not my favourite. I think I prefer the tradition fried lumpia better. But if you want a nice appetizer on the side that isn't deep fried, the fresh lumpia is the way to go. Think of it as a crepe with ube taste filled with fresh vegetables inside.The atmosphere is super cute in here, clean and simple.

Lasa by Lamesa,"My first official taste of a Filipino restaurant in Toronto and I will say that Lasa is a great one.  Highly flavourful, well cooked, and very affordable ... what's not to love?This small fast casual place has a cute but sparse dining room.  The flavours here are the opposite ... it delivers bold flavours that makes you want to try more dishes.  It is a counter cafeteria style ordering where they call your name when everything is ready.  The dining area is small... maybe 4 tables of 4 seating and two sets of bar seating.  So I cannot imagine this place during the busy dining hours.  We came early at 5 pm Saturday and all the tables were taken but the bar seating is available.When we first arrived, a friendly and helpful woman greeted us quickly.  We knew we had to get the Lumpia Shanghai and Fresh Lumpia.  Sadly they were all out of the Fresh ones already! With her help, we also ordered the fried chicken, Lasa salad, garlic rice, and a juice.  She mentioned it's enough for the two of us ... let's just say we ended up taking two take out boxes back with us!  A great amount of food for $40!We sat down at a table and noticed it had a tad bit of food left from the previous patrons.  A quick wipe and grabbing a few extra plates and we were ready for our meal.  The great thing was that our order did not take long ... definitely under 10 minutes.  They called our name and the tray was bursting with plates.  We definitely ordered too much.Lumpia Shanghai - fried pipping hot and filled with flavourful pork.  The vinegary fish sauce dipping sauce was a nice contrast to the Lumpia.  The edges were crispy and we got 6 rolls for $6.  Great value ... one slight comment, the central part of the roll wasn't crispy.  Not sure if they didn't fry long enough or lower temperature.  4/5Lasa Salad - lots of good veggies ... avocado, squash, tomato, cashews, daikon, carrot, tofu, and leaves.  I'm a salad eater so I liked this.  The tofu had a very interesting pungent flavour which I didn't  mind.  My dining partner was a little one and she wrinkled her nose ... it's a bit strong and different plus the skin was soggy so it just threw her off.  It is a bit higher priced ($13) but still good. 4/5Fried Chicken - Wow ... loved this.  I have no idea what they put into this but the crackly crispy skin is full on flavour and the chicken was so tender and moist.  I loved adding pieces of this to my salads and made for a great meal.  You get 4 large piping hot thigh pieces.  It is a tiny tad greasy but it's a minor comment to how incredible it tasted and crunched.  4.5/5Garlic rice - for $2 you get a big bowl of it that can feed 2 people easily.  Grab your breath mint cause they were joking on the garlic ... I loved it. The flavour was potently garlicky in a good way and was great to mix in with the fried chicken.I really liked this place ... incredible value for a very filling and flavourful meal.  If they just had the fresh Lumpia available, maybe a touch cleaner, tweaked their fried Lumpia to be crispier... this would be a perfect 5.  That shouldn't take away from the fact it was a great meal and a wonderful introduction to Filipino food for me.  Definitely recommend this place to try and order the chicken for sure!",4.0,4.0,43,2017-06-24,43.68228,-79.423962,Filipino
Lasa by Lamesa,"I don't normally go out for Filipino food because I find that most places are a miss, especially with the different ways we all can sometimes cook our staple dishes, however Lasa really blew me away with the quality in how they prepared our food.I ordered the Silog with the bbq skewers, while my partner ordered the crispy chicken. We added a side of lumpia shanghai, which came at a decent size with a great amount of flavour. The bbq skewers were VERY tasty! They were saucy, and marinated well. The over-easy egg that came with the silog was cooked to filipino-style perfection, as in, the edges were nice and crisp with some browning along the rim - serious skills back there! And it came with a little helping of achara and some salad.The helping was HUGE might I add - so for $12, it was definitely worth it! You feel full after this meal, I will say that.The space in itself is pretty cute and decorative with vibrant colours and eye-catching placements of picture frames, lights and a station for utensils, take out cups, etc. It didn't feel very Filipino-y to me though, as I didn't find much of that heritage reference within the restaurant. Service was friendly, and helpful and I like that you can help yourself to sit wherever you like - not sure if they do reservations, but my guest and I came early in the day for lunch, so maybe that's why we were so lucky to be able to do that freely.",4.0,5.0,43,2017-10-16,43.68228,-79.423962,Filipino
Lasa by Lamesa,"Lasa is one or those places where you order at the counter, eat at a table, and clean up your dishes before you leave. It's a small-ish, cozy place with wooden bowls and self-serving utensils. We ordered garlic rice, fried pork belly, vegetable lumpia, milkfish, and grilled chicken thighs.The garlic rice was basically garlic + rice. It was not something a restaurant commonly offers and so we ordered it. Nothing too special, and if you're a fan of steamed white rice, you're not missing out if you don't get it. Otherwise, give it a try.The skin part of the fried pork belly was way too hard. I'm not sure if it was meant to be like that or if we just had a batch with very tough and crunchy skin. Personally, I found it to be too much. The meat part, however, was very good. Juicy. And the fat that is supposed to be oily in the pork belly was not overly oily.The vegetable lumpia was essentially a vegetable spring rolls. It was ok. Loved the sauce that came with it so much that I ate the fried pork belly with the sauce.The milkfish was alright. It would have been so much better if we were given some sauce with it and if it were more juicy.The grilled chicken was seasoned very well. Loved the tenderness of the meat and the sauce, which had a citric taste to it. Would recommend ordering this.Tl;dr: Overall, it was a nice experience. My criticisms were the overly hard skin of the fried pork belly, and the lack of sauce for the pork belly and milkfish.

Verdict: adobo chicken came with 4 pieces of delicious and well seasoned chicken in a sweet, garlicy and tangy sauce. The fresh lumpia was loaded with crispy veggies and covered in some sort of purple crepe. I am to understand that this was made with purple yam. Whatever it's was, we loved it.

Lasa by Lamesa,"Modern rustic feel, cafeteria style, 3 godlike dishes are how I would describe Lasa in short bursts. Filipino food used to be new to me in the past when it was super unknown to me and now it seems to be all the rage these days in foodie scenes (new Filipino restos popping up and all) I really do believe there is a lot to discover with this type of cuisine and I highly recommend Lasa as a starting point.Lasa is casual but the food really shines. They divide the food in separate categories: fried/vegetables/main etc. We ordered the kare kare with oxtail stew, fresh lumpia, and fried chicken. The kare kare was a first for me, but I've heard many things about it and to me it was  so tasty. It's definitely not for the faint-hearted. It's got this very bold and pungent taste (it has peanut butter in it...I know!), but personally I loved it. The oxtail was super tender, probably braised/cooked for long hours, and everything about it was just powerful. I think it definitely could be one of those you either hate it or love it dishes. Next! Fresh lumpia, almost like a Filipino version of a spring roll minus the protein. The outside was made of ube crepe, which I didn't think would work, but it did! It was sweet but filled with fresh vegetables that somehow had a nice crunch and fantastic flavor to it. Fried chicken was also a winner for me. I have no idea what they flavored the batter with, but this is not like any other fried chicken you will taste. It had its own unique seasoning to it.Honestly, there were so many other dishes I really wanted to try, so I will have to come back!

Lasa by Lamesa,Lasa by Lamesa serves authentic Filipino food. The restaurant has a minimalist design. It seems more like a cafeteria than a restaurant. There's a takeout counter where you order your food. Service is minimal as well. The restaurant is designed for you to serve yourself. The food was quite good. The shrimp curry and spring rolls were my favourite.  The shrimp curry is prepared in a delicate coconut-miso broth which creates the rich flavours.

Lasa by Lamesa,"[23/100]Frankly, when I travel, I am more compelled by natural wonders & architecture. Los Angeles has a diverse food culture that satisfies my curiosity at all times, which results in a low drive to become a traveling foodie. I normally visit a local Trader Joe's and purchase trail mix, fresh fruits, protein bars & water. Food is fuel not indulgence when I travel. Lasa by Lamesa was a rare exception! As soon as I discovered it's existence, I bookmarked it on Yelp, typed it onto my itinerary and followed them on Instagram. Super easy to find, it's located at a building sectioned off into 3 or 4 other businesses. Parking was plenty! There were both residential, street and lot parking. All are metered aside from residential; however, it might be permit only. Watch out for signs, you are not immune to a parking ticket! Aesthetic: Minimal, clean, wooden floors, bright, modern, & patterns. One of the plus is the place is spacious, but limited in seating. There are tables good for groups and bar tables great for one or two people. They have plants on the table which is a great touch. They have a bar table facing the window that leads to the street, great for people watching! Their utensils, condiments, & drinks are self serve. Service/staff: There was a large group on my visit that had the Chef and staff a little flustered but I understand given that they were understaffed. There were two older gentlemen that were very focused on their tasks and may not be use to multitasking. I stood at the registered for a good 3 minutes before the Chef took my order. I placed my order and it didn't take too long and the Chef was very professional. I could tell he was stressed but he did great! Food: I ordered the Lumpiang Sariwa (Fresh Lumpia) with the ube wrapper. It was delicious! I should have order 2 more, to go! The veggies were fresh and cooked well. The sauce wasn't too sweet and there was some on the side, just in case I wanted to drizzle on some more. The wrapper was thick and stood against the veggies! I really like that! And the ube was subtle which I appreciated because ube is mostly used for desserts and not savory. It was filling and that's probably why I didn't order another one. Overall, the only improvement I would advise is staffing. The Chef and staff want to do well and get everything out in a timely matter which is appreciate but the stress is definitely apparent. Other than that, this place is great and they are bringing forth delicious Filipino food!",4.0,4.0,43,2017-02-13,43.68228,-79.423962,Filipino
Lasa by Lamesa,"Lasa by Lamesa is a casual cafeteria-like restaurant. You order at the counter, grab a seat, then wait for your name to be called to pick up your food.Despite being such a casual place, the food here is excellent, and prices are quite reasonable.I highly recommend the ox tail kare kare if you are sharing it with a friend (big portion).

Lasa by Lamesa,"Good Filipino food with a home-cooked feel. Much more traditional than Lamesa (which is really more re-imagined upscale fusion Filipino food), Lasa offers the typical dishes you'd find if you stopped by and had a family meal in any Filipino home. Our favourites were the silogs (we had the chicken, pork barbeque, fish and tofu versions, all paired with egg, rice and some veggies) which were well cooked, had generous servings and good value for money ($12 for each silog!). The desserts were also interesting - ube flan with pinipig had a nice crunch, while the ice cream scoops were from a local brand (we got the mango flavour - and if you've ever been to the Philippines, you know it has the best mangoes in the world!). Overall, would recommend going to Lasa if you want at taste of the simple and traditional Filipino meal.",4.0,4.0,43,2017-06-24,43.68228,-79.423962,Filipino
Lasa by Lamesa,"I had bookmarked Lasa by Lamesa for a while now but finally tried it out with my hubby. Based on some previous reviews, I was expecting food to be ordered cafeteria style, where you point to prepared foods, but was pleasantly surprised to order at the counter from a menu. The food was ready very quickly so it likely was ready prepared and plated to order. We ordered the fresh lumpia with the anticipation of the fresh ube-flavoured wrapper. This was plated nicely but for me the ube flavour was lost under the peanuts, sweet sauce, fresh vegetables and very cold temperature of the lumpia. I guess I was also looking for the garlicky kick in the sauce that I've come to expect from my family's fresh lumpia sauce but alas this was not my family's fresh lumpia. We ordered the bangus (milkfish) as our protein with the silog (fried garlic rice) combo. The bangus , pork BBQ skewers, and garlic rice were delicious. Eager to try more menu items, we subsequently ordered the lechon kawali, which was at least served warm. The lechon was pretty good, served mostly crispy but some pieces were on the chewy side. Again good, but not the best I've ever had.I like the look and feel of Lasa. Non pretentious, clean, seat yourself kind of place where you grab your own cutlery and wooden plates and plastic glasses. I hope they do well. I would return as I want to try their kare kare, fried chicken, and chicken inasal. 3.5 stars.",4.0,3.0,43,2016-10-29,43.68228,-79.423962,Filipino

This is definitely up there in terms of Filipino restaurants in North America, and I'm happy to support my generation of chefs and restauranteurs.You must eat these... The kare-kare. Slammin'.

The skin is karate kick to your face good, but I thought the meat was a bit underseasoned.Pass on the... Ginataan. Not really what I expected when it comes to squash/pumpkin done Filipino style.

Lasa by Lamesa,The place is well decorated. The food is even more pleasing to the eyes. We ordered couple of dishes to try things out as we are visiting the area. I got excited because they have chicken inasal. Here's my opinion on the food. As the food is presented so well. They look so amazing! Pictures are attached to this review. The Veggie Lumpia is really good and so is the crispy tofu. Fried bangus is hard to mess up since that is fried. And this place fried that bangus right. pork bbq is alright. Now the chicken inasal was disappointing. We all didn't like it. Most of oue kids didn't finish it. It was not the inasal taste I was expecting the marinade doesn't really go well.  I would have given the inasal 2 stars. But other food was fine and would not pull down the rating for one dish.,4.0,4.0,43,2017-11-17,43.68228,-79.423962,Filipino
Stelvio,"I've passed this place quite a few times on my way down Queen West and it always struck me. Superficially it was the decor. I love a place that looks cozy and quaint and Stelvio definitely does.They specialize in Northern Italian cuisine and it's a nice change from the standard run of the mill Italian food that restaurants usually have on their menus. I love the authenticity mixed with high-class dishes and plating. We were seated right away upon arriving, which was great, despite it being a Friday night.We ordered the sciatt (basically fried cheese balls from heaven). It's the perfect appetizer for any deep fried lover. The polenta fritters were perfectly fried, while the cheese had the most amazing melt-factor. I couldn't believe what I was tasting. For my main I ordered the tagliatelle ai funghi porcini and again, absolutely amazing. I love that the pasta is homemade in-house and the ingredients used I could just tell were of the freshest quality. I would definitely recommend this place! Not only is the decor amazing, giving it this cute and cozy vibe but the food exceeds what you'd think. Stelvio isn't just a pretty face on Queen West, the food actually does the talking. This would also be a prime spot for a date night. Next time you're in the mood for Italian food but are tired of the same-y menus everywhere under the sun, hit this place up, you'll be taken on a culinary journey, exploring the Italian north.",4.0,5.0,74,2018-01-04,43.649212,-79.395485,Italian
Stelvio,"I would say first- between a 3-4 star rating. We came for dinner on a Friday night.  We were seated right away and provided our menus.  Our server took a little while to come by, but when he did, he was great detailing the menu and wines.They bring bread and oil and olives to the table to start.  We ordered and shared the Taroz starter ( mashed potatoes mixed with green beans and cheese).  This was a very comforting starter, but lacked a little flavour given the cheese was very light. Still enjoyable.We shared the tagliatelle with Wild Boar (was the special) and the osso buco risotto.The pasta was fine, would have liked a bit more of the sauce.Overall pasta - underwhelming Now- the osso buco .. gimme a moment!!! This mix of risotto and the sauce and meat was DELICIOUS!! It's worth the $29 price! It's a larger serving and we took some home after!  Savoury and rich just blends so nicely .Wine was on the pricey side ..5oz for $19I would return for the osso buco for a special occasion.",4.0,3.0,74,2017-12-23,43.649212,-79.395485,Italian
Stelvio,"I discovered this tiny little Italian restaurant through yelp. On a warm summer day, I imagine it would be lovely to people watch on the patio (the restaurant is situated on a very busy section of Queen st).I tried two dishes - tagliatelle with fresh homemade meat sauce and fried herbs, and the risotto alla milanese with osso buco. I really enjoyed both the dishes- the risotto, in particular, was richly flavourful. The portion size was also very generous, and I packed half of it home for lunch the next day.Would definitely want to come back in the future and try other dishes!",4.0,4.0,74,2017-12-05,43.649212,-79.395485,Italian
Stelvio,"WHAT TO TRY?!Since you most likely tried mainly southern Italian cuisine in the many Italian restaurants you've been to, you might be up to trying a restaurant that specializes in Northern italian cuisine here!! Basically I would recommend all the dishes here because it's a different method of flavouring and cooking style. We tried the sciatt, a buckwheat fritter that had Valtellina Casera DOP cheese inside the balls! Very unique and very tasty especially when it's served hot, the cheese melts inside. We also had the tagliatelle with Ragu Bianco. Homemade tagliatelle with homemade meat sauce. Pasta was al Dante just the way I like it and the pasta had just the right amount of sauce. Not too much and not little. We also ordered from the second section and got the polenta salsiccia e Funghi. The sausages on this polenta tasted so good and I'm a big fan of porcini mushroom too so I liked the bite to this mushroom. The polenta was okay, you really need to eat it with the sausage and the mushroom to add the flavor into each bite of this dish. The waiter was super friendly and nice. She would walk me through the menu and explain what she would recommend us to eat depending on how hungry and how heavy we want the dishes. She would also be brave enough to say if it was too much and asked us to settle for less food to really enjoy the meal. I loved the music they played at this restaurant. They played Italian and it really added to the experience. I thought I was in Italy for a second in my time spent at the restaurant. LAST TIP?You can opt to share dishes because that's what we did so you don't have to just order pasta. You can opt to try the other dishes in the primi and secondi menu too! The restaurant is mainly open for dinners. Only time to catch them for lunch is Friday and Saturday!",4.0,4.0,74,2017-11-10,43.649212,-79.395485,Italian
Stelvio,"Stelvio is an Italian restaurant in Downtown Toronto. It was packed on a Saturday night and we were lucky to have a table. After glancing the menu, we placed our order. Shortly after, our server brought us a plate of Poppyseed Sesame Bread served with EVOO balsamic vinegar dipping sauce and herb marinated olives.Based on other Yelp review, we ordered the Taroz, which consisted of crushed potatoes with green beans, butter, onion and cheese served on a iron skillet. It was to die for. The only other thing to die for was Zuppa D'Orzo Carciofi E Patate, which was a soup with barley, artichoke, potatoes, and garlic.We're weren't too impressed with the Dante Salad, Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini, and Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini. The Dante Salad consisted of shredded pan seared chicken breast, Caesar DOP cheese, lettuce, and red chicory lightly tossed in a dijon vinaigrette. I didn't like how either Tagialette had much flavor or sauce. Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini consisted of fresh homemade tagliatelle pasta with porcini mushrooms. Tagialette Al Ragu Bianco consisted of fresh homemade tagliatelle pasta with homemade meat sauce and fried herbs including sage and rosemary.",4.0,3.0,74,2017-10-13,43.649212,-79.395485,Italian
Stelvio,"This place is critically underrated. I was seriously surprised how few people were here on a Sunday night.

Stelvio,"The hotel concierge had recommended a different Italian restaurant, but I didn't love the look of this. Given the Yelp reviews, I thought Stelvio would be a better choice. It was pretty quiet when I arrived, though some more folks came after. It's a cute little place, though the music choices (Elvis-esque music played a little too loudly) were a bit odd to me, and didn't help with the ambiance. In any case, the food is the thing, and so I ended up with a Montagna salad: arugula, fennel, Guanciale, mint and shaved Grana. It was quite tasty, and the lemon and EVOO dressing was nicely acidic without being too much so.I rarely order pasta as my main because of the carbs, but this seemed like a time to make an exception, and I ordered tagliatelle accompanied by what was described to me as a venison Bolognese. The pasta was cooked nicely, but the problem for me is that it felt like I was eating pasta and ground meat (venison in ground form, at least in this case, was pretty indistinguishable from ground beef) tossed together. Any sauce that had existed hadn't made it onto the plate, and so the dish felt disconnected and lacking for me--I ended up leaving some of it. I was disappointed and wished I'd gotten the rabbit dish I was considering (but I let the waitress talk me out of it).They also served some bread, along with olives, both of which were tasty (and of course a balsamic/EVOO combo for dipping).The other negative--other than my main course--was the wine. I wanted a white, and my only two choices were either $19 or $20. Pretty pricey for a neighborhood restaurant. I got one, but I regretted it, as dinner ended up running $75 with tip and tax. They were very nice and gave me a little glass of Amaro before I left, but while on balance I'd say the meal was OK, it just wasn't worth the price.",4.0,3.0,74,2017-11-06,43.649212,-79.395485,Italian
Stelvio,"Stumbled upon this place while shopping on Queen West, we felt like Italian and hey look! Stelvio is right here! What timing.I loved pretty much everything about this place: the decor, the service, and especially the food. I've eaten at a LOT of Italian restaurants around the GTA and this place really stands above with the dishes on the menu, they are not like the usual offerings you see around here.We tried the tagliatella with meat sauce, the sausage risotto, and started with the smashed potato appetizer (with onions, green beans, cheese and bacon). Literally every one of these dishes was amazing. My only complaint is that food took a while to come out, I found the seats very cramped and a bit uncomfortable by the end of our meal, and it was a lot louder in there than expected (though I blame this mainly on the loud couple next to us).Overall there's no way i'm not going back here for the amazing food and lovely staff (I love the little patio out front too and want to check it out).

Stelvio,"During our very first visit to the city of Toronto, my co-worker and I stumbled across this stylish Italian eatery off of Queen Street West. Stelvio was an exceptional dining experience from start to finish.From their carpaccio to their fresh handmade tagliatelle, everything we tasted was of excellent flavor, quality, and obvious authenticity. The atmosphere itself is very European - the venue is decidedly small, exhibiting an intimate, yet surprisingly comfortable dining environment. The service was also lovely and swift. Apparently, they have another restaurant in Milan, which is of no surprise - both the menu & execution of dishes would make any true Italian proud.A few Italian beers and delicious hand-rolled pasta makes for a great evening out in the 416.",4.0,4.0,74,2017-05-15,43.649212,-79.395485,Italian

Stelvio,"Came here with a reservation for a table for 4, on a Friday night at 7pm. There was still plenty of room them but filled up quickly but the time we left at 9 it was filled. I love the illustrations and their branding on the placemats and menu, and the cute baseball bench seating across the wall. We started with fritters with DOP cheese, this was quite disappointing barely any cheese and just tasted like fried dough. We also got the polenta toast with porchini and polenta fries, The polenta was soft on the inside and cripsy on the outside, a bit bland but was satisfying. I got the PIZZOCHERI DI TEGLIO, since it was very hyped up on here. The hand cut buck wheat noodles were ok, kinda too chewy and felt a bit gritty, the cabbage was bland but the cheese was good and it was very filling and served in a cute skillet. the TAGLIATELLE AI FUNGHI PORCINI was better, richer and flavourful sauce and good noodles. The RISOTTO ALLA MILANESE CON OSSOBUCO was excellent, the veal shank was tender and the risotto was flavourful (a bit on the salty side) but was savory, the portion was also huge. The food was good but i feel like there are much better places for italian food in the city especially within the same price point. The service was a bit slow between appetizer and entree, it took them a while to bring it out. The atmosphere is lovely though, really cozy and there seems to be other Italians eating there. the place gets really loud when filled but ,it feels like you are in another country by the end of the night.",4.0,3.0,74,2017-09-18,43.649212,-79.395485,Italian

Stelvio,"Come here at 5:25 on a Sunday night, the restaurant was not packed at that moment while some time later it was literally full of guests! The food are overall great, while the speed of serving is a little bit slow, since it is a small scale restaurant , it kinda makes sense. The zucca is absolutely fantastic!! The pumpkin filling is  so sweet and creamy to taste while the outer pasta is not too thick or hard , but offer a considerably suitable accompanying for the general texture! The risotto is gigantic in portion, the meat is so tender and the rice is right in cook, I normally would not like to order a risotto , but it is my type. The meat sauce pasta is great in flavor , the server asked me if i would like to add the tomato sauce into that, I said yes! why not? However, the gnocchi is too soft in texture that is even become marshy in your mouth and the sauce is too salty in my opinion. I would not recommend it for sure.They do offer the free pre-meal bread with the preserved olive and the olive oil with balsamic vinegar to dip. Definitely remember to ask them more vinegar since it is sooooo good! The plate of cured meat with cheese is nice, but the meat might can be more in varieties. The pickled veggies on the side is so much tasty! The salad is just a normal one, which is not that recommend one. The last but not the least, the deep fried buckwheat cheese balls are great, they are crispy outside and gooey inside, you can clearly taste the cheese aroma but not that overwhelming to make you feel sick!

However, I give them only 3 stars for lack of organization. While waiting for my pot pie to heat (~ 10 minutes), they could have given me the root beer or the cookie I ordered/paid for. By the time my food came, they had completely forgotten about my drink and I had to remind them which one I ordered. My pot pie combo also came with a cookie. I ordered the birthday cookie, which they also completely forgot about, and I left the store without it. I only remembered when I got home! I was going to give it to my fiancé tonight as a dessert...",4.0,3.0,19,2014-12-10,43.652031,-79.447896,Canadian (New)

Dundas Park Kitchen,"I was wandering around with a friend from Dundas West station and stumbled upon here. An excellent place with awesome sandwiches, great service, and a neat little atmosphere. If you're ever looking for lunch, Dundas Park Kitchen is a great bet.I picked up the Meatloaf Melt sandwich and it packed a tonne of taste! When you have meatloaf, you don't really expect refined flavours but I was really impressed with its quality. No idea what cheese they were using was but it was delicious. My friend got one of their pot pies and a salad which he told me he enjoyed as well. We also had one of their galettes (I want to say it was bumbleberry) and it was also really good; we scarfed it down embarrassingly quickly. The service was also quite on point. The woman working at the front asked us how our food was and seemed to actually care about how we were enjoying it. There's not a whole lot of seating (it's really only a few stumps near the window -- but it's a nice view from the stumps) but otherwise, it's a good space.  Definitely check it out if you're ever in the area and need lunch.",4.0,5.0,19,2015-07-30,43.652031,-79.447896,Canadian (New)
Dundas Park Kitchen,"I woke up this morning craving soup and googled ""best soup in Toronto"" only to be directed to Dundas Park Kitchen. What a fantastic find. After one trip to DPK I'm already a fan.Lots of great lunch options, too many to choose from. I opted for a roasted chicken sandwich and a tomato soup with cheddar croutons. The soup was FABULOUS! It was definitely one of the best tomato soups I've ever had. It was so flavourful but not too tart like some tomato soups can be. I could eat this ever lunch. Even though I want to try the other soups that DPK has, I may have to opt for the tomato soups again because it was that good. The sandwich was very good as well. It had roasted chicken, sun-dried tomato, Portuguese cheese, crispy prosciutto and lettuce. It was very good. The bun made it a little difficult to eat, it was still very good. The soup was definitely the shining star of the meal. Next time I may just opt for a meal sized soup and skip the sandwich. I love the look and vibe of the place. The staff was very friendly. I will definitely go back.",4.0,4.0,19,2014-02-27,43.652031,-79.447896,Canadian (New)

Far from ordinary and a great alternative to ""convenience"" food like subway...The owners both work in the kitchen and at the front and are exceedingly helpful and friendly.

Cava,"Excellent service while seated at the bar.  I had the Octopus Tiradito appetizer, followed by the oyster mushroom second, and finished it off with the Sabel fish.  The roasted pepper of the appetizer gave the dish a very nice smokey aroma which complimented the octopus quiet well.  The saltiness of the olives also was a nice accent to the octopus which was not over cooked as so often they can be.  The oyster mushroom though I think stole the show and must be tried to be believed.  The mix of earthy and salty flavors from the squash mole combined with fresh flavors from the Chayote really elevate this dish above the rest my meal.  The sabel fish was probably my least favorite, but that doesn't mean it was bad, but I think there are a few missteps in execution.  First, the fish was not seasoned consistently with some bites that were much saltier than others.  For a small portion like they have I feel like it should have been better seasoned.  Secondly and perhaps more importantly, I my collard greens ended up soaking up all the oil and was very greasy.  I think the idea of having some slightly bitter greens to contrast the flavor of the fish is the right one but the execution could have been better.With that said, I still think this is one of the better restaurants in Toronto.  Don't be fool by the yelp price guide though, if you are looking to get full and have a drink with your dinner, your looking at 85 CAD or more/person.",4.0,4.0,127,2017-06-15,43.689561,-79.395044,"Spanish , Tapas/Small Plates"

The food was all very good but portions were tiny - expected for a tapas restaurant, sure, but some of them were comically small. I had a pintxos to start, the croqueta of jamon, which was delicious but a bit of a stretch at $4. The meats and fish all seemed to be high quality, and there were some interesting flavour combinations. Interior of the restuarant is nice and service was good, too.  Overall a good evening, but I just don't think the value is there.

I didn't know what to expect but everything exceeded my expectation  except for one thing, you will know at the end. I was confused what to order and the chef there said he can custom the dishes and make them smaller so I can try different ones which for me was amazing I never had this offer in any other restaurant. They served half portion of the salad, half portion of the octopus and the sardine which is a small portion. I wasn't that hungry but I enjoyed every bite, the salad was amazing the pistachio gave it an amazing taste and crunch. Eventhough it was half size but it was filling. The octopus was perfectly done the combination of the flavours were amazing, the olive the sauce the octopus; very well done. So back to what didn't meet my expectation; if they give you a cookie when tbey bring your check, don't eat it, it will take away all the good flavors that you just ate, put it aside or take it home, for me it didn't taste good.",4.0,5.0,127,2017-09-21,43.689561,-79.395044,"Spanish , Tapas/Small Plates"

We ordered the oyster mushrooms, shrimp ceviche, octopus adobo and the paella. The turnaround time was good with each dish coming right after we completed the previous dish with the exception of the paella (takes a longer time to prepare). For dessert we decided to share the pistachio cake.1) Oyster Mushroom - Very well cooked mushrooms with a delicious garlic sauce.2) Shrimp Ceviche - Good amount of shrimp and good contrast between the seafood flavour and tang from the lime juices.3) Octopus - Extremely tender octopus with an equally delicious potato pancake.4) Paella - Large portion with a variety of proteins including chicken hears, escargots, clams and chorizo. Only aspect I would change is to cut down on the salt levels.5) Pistachio Cake - Moist slice of cake with just the right level of sweetness.Overall, a very good Spanish tapas restaurant and would come back again for another special occassion.",4.0,4.0,127,2016-06-22,43.689561,-79.395044,"Spanish , Tapas/Small Plates"
Cava,"This little Spanish restuarant is tucked inside a small plaza a block north of Yonge/St Clair. The atmosphere is quite intimate.The apps or pinchos were small packets of disinct flavors. The supergilda was a savoury sardine-based pincho that opened your appetite for the upcoming courses. The croqueta of jamon was a bit too creamy for me, but I can see how someone would prefer that.The red fife wheatberry salad tasted fresh, but it was drenched in argan oil, which drowned out the taste of the other vege/fruit components.The sliced jamon or ham was amazing. Definitely get a plate! The ham had a good balance of fat and lean meats and you can just feel the flavour sink into your tongue.The grilled octopus was the winner. It was not chewy nor did it taste fishy. The meat was cooked to a tender state with the smokeness coming out in every bite.Our server recommended an off menu item, the roasted quail.

Cava,"Cava was so delicious! Is it bad to say my favorite of the night was the Warm Marinated Olives - i really think I am an olive fan after eating these perfectly salty olives. The Halibut Ceviche was really delicious - first time having halibut this way and the fish was cut into thick large chunks which soaked up the lime, cilantro & onion flavours. The corn nuts gave it texture but the pieces are kind of big which could be too much for some people. I liked my cocktail Spanish Steps - full of orange & grapefruit at first, followed by the alcohol aftertaste.The fried Japanese Eggplant was good when hot, didn't really care for the cheese. King Oyster Mushrooms were good; Beets were good but we opted out of the blue cheese. Duck Breast was cooked perfectly and was good on its own or paired with the lentils. The Fries are literally just fries with rosemary when I'd expected the usual patatas bravas with potato cubes in tomato sauce - still good but not very Spanish (although the server and menu clearly states fries so just my own misinterpretation). Overall a very satisfying meal. The restaurant is kind of hidden and seems out of place from the outside ie. a fancy restaurant in the midst of more casual stores. Good for groups of 2!!

Sounded absurd until you see just how small some of these are -- actually one bite...Things that really stood out on top of the wine were the filled red peppers; they had so much flavour. I ended up eating the duck dish to myself which was perfectly cooked and you can't go wrong with the churros!

Yasu,"If you want to experience omakase, this is the place you have to go! The restaurant itself is super small and you'll be eating in a very intimate setting (a little less than 20 seats in the restaurant). Seating is either around the bar or on the tables about 2 feet away from the bar. I would definitely go with bar seating for the full experience. Right off the bat you'll be treated by the servers and the sushi chefs and they'll give you their full attention throughout the serving. I was given the option of choosing between the regular omakase and and upgrade to premium sashimi for an extra $25. I figured if I'm spending $110 anyways, an extra $25 couldn't hurt. With the premium upgrade, I was served toro sashimi, uni and scallop. The sashimi and all the seafood that followed was extremely fresh and clean (to taste). It's impossible to expect what seafood you'll be served that night as omakase plates depend on seasonality. However during my visit I had to opportunity to try such nigiris as monk fish liver, stripejack, mackerel, uni, and red shrimp. With each dish the servers or sushi chef will explain the food being presented in front of you, where it came from and how to eat it. We finished the nigiri selection with beautifully sweet tamago and fragrant black sesame ice cream. My favourite for the night was the monkfish liver nigiri, the shiso and ponzu daikon helped cut through the heaviness of the liver. I was also surprised with the shirako as I expected the slimy texture to be off putting but it wasn't and almost dissolved in your mouth. They tell you is ""a part of cod"" without any further description and I wouldn't advise googling which part unless you are truly curious. Overall a great experience and I would definitely come back without hesitation if it were a special occasion.

Yasu,"WOW. $105/person (+$25 for the premium sashimi plate) seems to be very excessive for sushi but this is MORE than just food...it truly is an experience that comes with it!What is OMAKASE?It's basically a tasting menu of seasonal fish of the sushi chef's choosing that differs every time (which is why they don't have a specific menu). The sushi chef makes the dishes right in front of you and explains the ingredient while serving it.//THE FOOD//~20 sushi pieces/dishes were served, with a small scoop of black sesame ice cream at the very end of the meal. My personal favourite dishes were the monk fish liver, salmon roe with sashimi on seasoned rice, uni sashimi, and the medium fatty salmon sashimi.//THE EXPERIENCE//They only take reservations and make sure you request for the bar seat so you can witness all the sushi making magic! Once you walk in, only 2 servers are present, come early so you get to choose where you sit. There's a sushi master and 2 other sushi chefs that are in charge of making all the food. The meal starts off with the sashimi plate and it's about a 5-10 minute wait for the making of each of the subsequent sushi/dish. Throughout the entire night, I interacted with the sushi master who was serving our corner of the bar seating area. He's very polite and answered all my questions about the fishes he used/inspiration behind some of the dishes! //OVERALL//This place definitely gave me an unforgettable dining experience.

Yasu,"Yasu proves their spot as top Omakase dining experience in Toronto! There is an option of regular ($105/person) or premium ($130/person) for omakase - comes with sashimi, sushi and dessert. The difference is the sashimi served and all else are the same. We decided to go with the premium, and we have no regrets - everything was so fresh and delicious!I love how Yasu takes time to introduce every single piece, making sure you know what you are eating and where the seafood came from. (Service is simply amazing!) I kind of wish I made more notes, but this review would have to go off on my memory. Below are my TOP PICKS for the premium omakase experience (Dec 05, 2017):- SASHIMI PLATTER (premium): My top 3 were the uni from Japan, the scallops and the oyster. You can really taste the freshness and sweetness of the seafood (I'm getting hungry just thinking about it...)- FISH ROE AND UNI DONBURI: This was just unforgettable for me! The uni was very creamy, and it tasted amazing mixed with the rice and fish roe.- MISO SOUP: This was simple yet so bold in flavours, brewed with fish bones- SNOW CRAB WITH CRAB LIVER: The snow crab was so so sweet, and the crab liver was extremely flavourful and not fishy(?). - MACKEREL SUSHI: This was from Iceland and it was wrapped with a thin slice of radish to balance off the taste of the fishFYI - This is a small location so make sure to book a reservation either on yelp or call in!

Yasu,"Likely the best sushi and sashimi I've had outside Japan. You must arrive on time and the omakase style menu means you eat what the chef serves. Not for picky eaters, but such a treat to anyone with a love of fresh fish!!",4.0,5.0,257,2018-01-28,43.662727,-79.403279,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Yasu,"Great dining experience at Yasu! The hubby and I came here to celebrate our anniversary and we couldn't be happier with the whole experience.  We sat at the bar (must do) so we got to watch how the sushi chefs fillet and prepared each piece of fish with great details and precision.  Seeing and then tasting it made it a great experience so make sure you don't get stuck sitting at the tables behind the bar. As for the food, it was heavenly delicious. Each piece of sushi has an unique taste with the various garnish like sheiso leaf, daikon, spicy roe, crab liver mousse, Yuzu zest and don't even get me started on the variety of sauces.  We had so many different types of fish that I can't even keep track but what I know is all my previous bad experiences with certain type of fish for example mackerel doesn't apply here. Every thing was uber fresh and didn't have any fishy taste to it.  I would recommend getting the premium Omasake, for $25 more, you will get sea urchin, blue fin tuna, scallop and 2 more premium fish. It's worth it.",4.0,5.0,257,2017-10-10,43.662727,-79.403279,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Yasu,"Location/ServiceA very small restaurant located on Harbord St. Street parking is available and a few parking lots around the neighborhood. Inside is a very simple decor with around 16 seating available. Make sure you try to make your reservation by the bar so you can fully see how the chefs prepare all the sashimi and sushi right in front of your eyes. Service is also good. The waitress and chef were very detailed in explaining each piece. I had to reschedule my reservation and the waitress was quick and accommodating to make the change. FoodAt a fixed price around $105, each meal differs day to day as it's omakase, meaning the chef's selection. For this experience, I get to experience tamago, unagi, black sesame ice cream. And a lot of imported fish such as Nova Scotia lobster, BC sea urchin, Iceland mackerel, Mexico and Japan imported fish (salmon, skipjack, cod, shimaji, scallops, blue fin tuna). For my first experience, I really enjoyed it and can justified its worth the price. Rated as the best restaurant in Canada, Yasu really deserves a 5-Star rating!",4.0,5.0,257,2017-11-08,43.662727,-79.403279,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Yasu,"Yasu is a great spot for birthday, anniversary, or any special occasion celebrations.Reservations: - Reservations open up 1 month in advance, and always always ALWAYS reserve the bar instead of the odd table in the back behind the bar seating.Price: - It's not ridiculously pricy at $105 per person for some really good quality sashimi.- I also recommend getting the sashimi platter at an extra $25. You're already there so might as well!Menu:The menu varies depending on the fish in season but you'll probably always get some of the classics (3 tuna belly slides at various fat levels, sea urchin etc)Staff:There are 3 chefs covering 2 or 3 pairs at the bar. They explain to you where the fish is from and tell you how to eat it. Watching them prepare and cut the slices of fish was really neat.

Yasu,"WHAT TO TRY?!Omakase!! Whether it be the regular omakase or the premium upgrade of the omakase, they are both delicious!Regular omakase costs $105 pp and the upgrade is an additional $25 pp. The only difference between the regular and the upgrade is the amount of sashimi you get with the upgrade as the first course. Regular would only get you an oyster and scallops whereas a premium omakase will get you an additional sashimi pieces. You get uni from Japan, blue fin tuna slices, lobster sashimi, and stripe jack fish slice. You have to really love fish because the whole omakase is fish from different areas of the world! The experience really takes you around the world with the fish they source from and present before you. Their kitchen is basically what you see when you enter the restaurant! They make everything at the bar. It's really cool to see them make your sushi right before your eyes. Unlike other omakase, it's not about the presentation here. Nothing fancy accompanies the sushi or sashimi slices and you won't see any flowers or fog or great presentation. It's just the freshness of the fish and where they source their fish that makes up the price that you pay. My favorite dish is of course the blue fin tuna. There were three pieces of different sections of the blue fin tuna that was served as three pieces of sushi as one course. I loved every piece of it that I ordered more of it! If you want more sushi, you can order at the end of the meal too. Just to let you know the benchmark you're looking at is $7-9 per sushi if you want more sushi and depending on what sushi you order more of! There is also a wine menu that you can order alcohol to accompany your omakase experience. Ranges from 4 oz of sake to 9 oz of Japanese wine to a full bottle of 300-700 ml. There was one bottle of Japanese wine that was about $1000! You can also do sake pairing ($65) with the set course which is nice! Overall, I thought the chefs were nice to show their knife craftsmanship before our eyes and our particular chef greeted us with a smile. I liked how they kept asking us how our experience was and made us feel very welcomed. And most of all, the dishes came from all over the world. From Boston to Vancouver to Mexico to Iceland to Alaska to New Zealand, I felt like I went fishing around the world and got to taste of the world! LAST TIP?!The restaurant is REALLY small. I really recommend you to make a reservation to sit at the bar because you get to see the knife action before your eyes. Like I said, the kitchen is basically where the three chefs stand at the bar. There are only two tables that surround the outer area of the bar that people can sit at. Either two or four people. You can somewhat see the chef but you won't have a good view of the fish they are slicing or what they are doing behind the bar! So yes, worth the wait to find a spot at the bar!! Premium upgrade is worth it if you love sashimi and want to try out more sashimi from various parts of the world. It is also additional food so if you're up for more, premium is a good option to go. I think I would still order premium set next time I go! Mind you, some of the sushi you order may appear throughout the courses you see with the regular omakase too (except for the lobster sashimi, and the uni sashimi that is from Hokkaido). There's no particular spot where I would sit at the bar that would be better. I guess it depends on which chef you like best if you go here often but it's usually preassigned because there's only 12 seats around the bar for each sitting!!",4.0,5.0,257,2017-11-19,43.662727,-79.403279,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Yasu,This is one fine Japanese restaurant.  The omakase experience is extraordinary and the ingredients can't be more fresh!Sitting at the bar allows you to interact with the chef and see their delicate and skillful techniques while they prepare each piece.  The attention to detail and subtleties add so much to the flavours of each unique piece of sushi.The steady pace of the meal leaves you comfortably full at the end in such a way like it's the healthy pace and portion to eat at.What used to be priced at $80pp was a steal.  At $105 I would call this fair market value.  An optional $25 upgrade for a premium sashimi is fair too and the meal is pleasant whether you opt in or out of that.Probably not an everyday meal sort of destination but certainly a great way to indulge for a special occasion.The only drawback?  You gotta book way ahead to ensure you get a spot!,4.0,5.0,257,2017-10-10,43.662727,-79.403279,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Yasu,"If you always thought tomago (egg sushi) was the worst sushi of them all that's because you haven't had good tomago. Yasu will enlighten your taste buds.

Yasu,"Wow, what an experience. Going to Japan has always been such a dream of mine, so to get a little slice of what it'll be like here on Harbord St? Amazing!It was a 2-hour seating, with around 16 ""dishes"" which include pieces of sushi, some toro and ikura over rice, the most DELICIOUS miso soup I've ever had in my life, and of course, tamago to end the meal. They change it up based on what's in season, but if you're dying to get something they didn't offer as part of the omakase, they'll ask you afterwards if you'd like a little something extra--and chances are they'll have what you're looking for. The service was fantastic and I loved that it was such an intimate experience! The bar only seats 12 (If I remember correctly) and it gave us the chance to converse with the sushi chefs and the other diners and it was just such a nice time. Come here.

Yasu,"I have been to Yasu 4 times and all experience are very impressed!  That's why I come back again and again.  The new sashimi plate for $25 definitely worth the price.  A must add on for the first time visit.  The omakase price increased from 80 to 105 now, but I still believe the price is acceptable especially when compare to quality and service to Zen.  Remember to leave some room for the ice cream.  Just a reminder that extra piece at the end does cost extra $8-10 per piece!Yasu is always my favourite omakase location",4.0,5.0,257,2017-11-18,43.662727,-79.403279,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Yasu,"YASU was my first omakase experience and after hearing great reviews and seeing all the pictures, I had high expectations for both the restaurant and omakase in general. We came in on a Sunday night at the 9:30pm slot with reservations and it was still a full house, so reservations are probably either required or highly recommended (we had reservations). I understand there is a penalty for late cancellations We sat at the bar infront of the 3 sushi chefs, which I highly recommend as you get to watch them prepare your sushi in awe. Our sushi chef appeared to be the lead / head sushi chef and was fantastic. He clearly explained each piece of sushi to us and was kind and smiled to us throughout.We ordered the omakase experience at $105 and added the sashimi special for an extra $25 - pricey.My favourites were the toro (tuna), stripe fish, shrimp, and the sashimi platter (which I think was worth the extra money).Overall, a great and I'd recommend YASU to anyone looking for a premium omakase experience in the city.",4.0,5.0,257,2017-08-21,43.662727,-79.403279,"Japanese , Sushi Bars"
Yasu,"I picked Yasu for my birthday dinner this year because I heard so many glowing reviews about this place. First things first, the restaurant is small, so be sure to book early (resos open 30 days in advance). I booked maybe 20 days before my birthday and couldn't get a seat at he bar, which is highly recommended. We were seated at a small table by the window, which was nice, but the whole time I was throwing envious glances at the diners at the sushi bar. I feel that sitting at the sushi bar really elevates the whole omakase experience. As for the food, it did not disappoint. I thought the sushi overall was exquisite, and I also appreciated the education throughout dinner (the chef or a server will come explain to you where each fish is from). I paid an extra $25 for the deluxe sashimi plate, which included oyster, sea urchin, and fatty tuna on top of what was offered in the standard set. That's basically everything I love, so I thought it was well worth the extra charge. One area that left me desiring more was the dessert- it was simply black sesame ice cream. For the price paid, I'd like to have seen something a little more creative.But all in all, I had a fantastic experience at Yasu. It's definitely not cheap (but apparently it's pretty well priced for omakase), but the sushi is truly delicious.

Yasu,"waoooooow this place is amazing. It really set the bar high for any regular sushi place I go to now. Quality of every ingredient really shined through - the rice, the sashimi, the seaweed. Amazing quality. We came in February, and I believe the menu change due to in-season of the ingredients. It was artful and informative about where the ingredients come from. This was my first time trying omakase and it's truly an excellent experience. Everything was top notch - excellent service, excellent atmosphere, food was delicious. We booked at least one month in advance to be able to sit at the bar for 3 people.

Yasu,"Tip 1: Book a month in advance via yelp - make sure you have your credit card. They need it for the reservation. Tip 2: Get a bar seat - the table seats are so NOT worth it. You need to see them in action!Tip 3: Be prepared to try new seafoodI took my husband here for his birthday last night. We were super lucky to get a bar seat where Chef Yasu was serving us. There are 3 sushi chefs, 12 bar seats, and 4 table seats. There's three seating times I believe. We went for 7:15pm and finished around 9:15pm. We ordered the tasting menu for $105 and added an additional sashimi platter per individual for $25 each. It was TOTALLY worth it! We were super full at the end of this dinner, which as a serious surprise.Verdict: Unique foods, thoughtful and detailed chefs, and a wonderful experience.I have been to Japan twice, and many Japanese Omakase tasting menus, including my favourite restaurant in Toronto, Sushi Kaji, and I was prepared to compare it to Yasu.To my surprise, they are pretty different. Yasu has this unique feature where they get specialty fish from all over the world, and some are only in season for a short period of time. It makes me think Chef Yasu hand picks each fish. We tried many unique fishes here. The quality of Yasu and Kaji are on par, both amazingly fresh. Experience is similar, but I do have to say, while Kaji will always hold a special place in my heart, Yasu came out on top (ever so slightly) with it's unique menu. I also want to add that kaji does other dishes like tempura whereas yasu focuses on seafood so it's hard to compare. We had: Sashimi platter: Oyster from BC with a unique Japanese sauce, tuna from japan, bonito (seared fish), amberjack, lobster sashimi, and uni. Very nicely paired with different flavours from all the seafood. Chefs took care arranging each piece. They even grounded up fresh Japanese wasabi in front of us. 9 pieces for $25 Tasting menu: 1. Monkfish liver with fluke fish fin - amazing flavour. I have never had monkfish or fluke before. Google monkfish. They are scary looking!2. Salmon Roe and fatty tuna topping rice - the roe was not too salty, paired nicely with the rice and fatty tuna.3. Fresh live shrimp from BC - only in season for four weeks - Chef Yasu took it out live,  inspected it, and prepared it in front of us. He was so detailed, only putting a drop of soya sauce on it.4. Fluke fish - new for me! Google it!5. Scallop sashimi sushi - very fresh. You can taste each piece of rice and it was not too sweet.6. Firefly squid - the servers came around with ipads showing us this firefly squid in it's natural habitat in Japan. They glow in the dark like fireflies It only lives for one year and it was in season right now. It was very good. He put a miso sauce on it, which made it sweet and flavourful. *one of my fave dishes7. Stripe Jack fish - very unique, a new try for me8. Sakura shrimps - crunchy and flavourful. Never had such tiny fresh shrimps. *another home run9. Fluke fish miso soup - the chef made it in front of us. It was so good!!!10. Three different tunas from Japan - lean, medium, and fatty belly - totally reminded me of Japan. So so so FRESH! I loved how they paired it like this so people can compare the three parts of the tuna! Exactly like how i had it in Japan.11. Ocean Trout from Scotland - I can't tell how this is different from salmon, but it was amazing!12. Mackerel - this was so good. Not too salty and perfectly seasoned.13. Fresh water eel with a sweet Japanese sauce - I didn't even know there was a difference between fresh water and salt water eel! It was fried and served hot. Very good!14. Egg sushi - very soft and sweet. It was almost like a dessert.After this last piece, if you are still hungry, you can add extra pieces. We were super full and didn't need to add anything.15. Dessert: Green tea ice cream with red bean topping - they added a candle for my husband because it was his birthday. *make sure you tell them when they call to confirm your reservation.We got lucky and got to take a photo with Chef Yasu.I really enjoyed Yasu. We paid about $350 with tax and tip. Expect to try different fishes depending on what is in season.

Aviv Restaurant,"Wow. This is the stuff.  This is the hidden gem of an area that is rather lack luster.  Aviv is hidden away in a somewhat regrettably run-down area near Casa Loma, making it a convenient choice for lunch/dinner before or after trekking through the historical site. At first glance, I wasn't so sure about the quality of food and service when my party parked because even the outside of Aviv remains somewhat unkept.  However, lo and behold you're transported to a funky and somewhat high class dining landscape when you pass through the thick velvet curtains at the front. The service here was phenomenal.  Various servers checked up on us on a regular basis, and one of them included a gentleman that I presume is the owner - that's true devotion to keeping it real with the customer experience. Food-wise, the portions were just right for a hungry hippo and my party was unanimously positive with the flavour of our dishes. I ordered the burger, the cheaper main dish on the dinner menu.  The burger was juicy and satisfying, even without any additional condiments.  It wasn't a crazy concoction like what you would get from Burger's Priest, but it was a burger that you just couldn't disagree with. Also, the cooks were very generous with the fries that came with the burger as a side.  There were almost as many as what you would get in a bag of fries from Five Guys, and that's saying a lot!  They weren't those soggy fries that sit in the kitchen either. They were salty and crisp, just like how I like them to be.  If I didn't have to go to Casa Loma right afterwards, I would have taken my fries to go instead of feeding them to the restaurant's green bin. The salt is real here!Long story short, I definitely recommend you to go to Aviv if you're in the area. It's perfect for friends, dates, and family gatherings. You're never going to be short-changed by the service and food, even if it's not in the best type of neighborhood.",4.0,4.0,65,2017-10-30,43.674554,-79.408984,Mediterranean
Aviv Restaurant,"Went for winterlicious, and remembered that this place caters to the Annex which I'd a mix of student and long time residents. That's the type of place this seems to be. What really appealed to me was that based on the menu it looked like Mediterranean fusion of flavours with lots of fresh and very flavourful ingredients. In terms of winterlicious it was the cheapest option. The atmosphere was fine. Not a basement per se but a nice spot just off Dupont and Spadina. Lots of street parking. The inside seemed a little confusing, didn't know if it was an old school British pub style or bistro. I'll lean towards the former but really was looking forward to the food.Tried the Lamb Meatballs and Mussels as appetizer. Both fresh with nice flavours in a good quantity size. Definitely filling for sure. Main were Jerk Pork Tenderloin and Yogurt marinated Chicken kebob. Both were just okay. I tried really hard to like the pork but it was a little dry, and the sweet potato mash and kale were nothing special. One thing that surprised me was the mango sauce. Didn't go perfectly but was an interesting twist. The kebob was very middle of the road. Pretty much the same thing you can get at any shawarma or Greek fast food place. There wasn't a tzatziki sauce it was literally just plain yogurt. Dessert was very meh as well both the cheesecake and banana bread pudding. Not all bad though. Found out that they do BYOB wine Tuesday and Wednesday and on Monday all wine is half price which if you're looking for a place to drink a lot of wine this is good. Overall, tried really hard to get excited and like this place based on the menu but it fell short of expectations which may have been higher than they needed to be.

Aviv Restaurant,"Loved the service. Our server was really accommodating and super cheerful. We ordered the veggie mezza platter with a range of standards (hummus, tahini, tabbouleh) and some special ones (butternut squash). I loved the butternut squash and the eggplant. The baba wasn't super smokey, which is great for me. This platter was yummy overall, but was super pricey and expensive imo - $18, but the plate was on the smaller side. More like a standard serving plate, when I was expecting more on a bigger plate.Also got the Moroccan Lamb & Beef Kefta Meatballs. There were 3. The shakshuka (tomato based) sauce went very well with the meat, although the meatballs themselves were on the dry side. That I think made it fall between the fair and pricey range for $10. This is also where I loved our server btw - I had really wanted to get the kefta as a sandwich, but that was only available during lunch (we arrived at 4pm), so she gave us some extra homemade pita bread on the side so I could DIY my own. Points!Really good homemade pita flat bread btw - a warm, homey smell with a nice crunch on the outside and doughy inside.Overall, I'd come back again, but maybe during lunch time proper since the food I like and would get is cheaper during that period.",4.0,4.0,65,2016-12-30,43.674554,-79.408984,Mediterranean
Aviv Restaurant,"Met up with some friends I haven't seen in forever at Aviv for Stop 2 of my Winterlicious adventures. It was very busy! We only waited a few minutes before we were seated by the owner. He was serving, clearing tables and greeting people; he was on top of things! He apologized for the wait even though there wasn't really one long enough to complain about. He had a good sense of humour about it and laughed at my jokes, so he was already winning in my books! ;) We ordered drinks and made our selections. Yay for appetizers; we were starving! The Risotto Balls were fabulous. Smoked tomato sauce smothered over Italian arborio rice stuffed with buffalo mozzarella and wild mushrooms and drizzled with basil pesto. Doesn't that sound heavenly?? It was!  I've had Gnocchi a thousand times. I love it. This was unexpected! It's called Housemade Potato Gnocchi, but it was more like little fluffy clouds with a smooth texture, almost like melted cheese covered in a savoury tomato cream sauce. I didn't want to share even one bite with my friends. Traditionally, potato gnocchi are denser, but these were very light; the portion was the perfect size. I love that Winterlicious comes with dessert, so I don't have to feel guilty about having it. :D On with the theme, I had the Light & Fluffy Lemon Cheesecake. I didn't taste any lemon, but the cheesecake was indeed light and fluffy. The blueberry compote stole the show. It was a great finish to a savoury meal and not too sweet. The service was really stellar. The owner and our server were warm and funny. Both taking a few minutes to chat like we went there all the time.

The trout was great as well. The rice pudding wasn't our favourite, mostly due to the unique texture of crunchy rice with mushy pudding. I like that they had a bit more selection to their Summerlicious menu compared to other restaurants, with five different appetizer and entree selections.

I had the kababs which were great, but my friend had the NY strip special and it was cooked to PERFECTION!

Aviv Restaurant,"Had never heard of this place prior to booking it during Winterlicious for my birthday dinner with my family. I wasn't quite sure what this place was when I entered, I knew it was described as Mediterranean but that's sort of a broad descriptor when that may include, Middle Easter, Greek, and any number of other cuisines.I'm still not sure but if I had to wager I guess I might say Israeli-Middle Eastern? At any rate the reviews seemed good and I was open to pretty much anything if it was a birthday treat.The Winterlicious menu was $25/person and included the standard 3 course offering - Appetizer, Main, dessert.I won't go into all the details of what we all had but true to form this restaurant subscribed to the Winterlicious formula of discounted prices meaning severely discounted portion sizes. The rib option that my brother ordered was 4 very tiny ribs and the big push here from the server was the sweet potato fries that accompanied it, she mentioned they was amazing. The dish arrived with 4 ribs and regular fries. There wasn't even a courtesy ""Oh I'm sorry to let you know we are out of_______"" before hand, just food arrived and put down like we wouldn't notice. my brother asked and was given a flippant - ""Yes we're out of those"". No apology, no concessions made... just basically, here are fries.My meal was OK. To start I had the beef carpaccio appetizer which was two very thin slices on a plate, ok, but an amuse bouche at best... not a appetizer. I had the chicken kebab on rice. Which came with a 1/4 piece of pita. Really a quarter of a piece? Are you saving that much money on the bread? The chicken however made up for it in how plump and juicy each piece was and in how it was seasoned. To end I had the flourless chocolate cake, which was similar to a two bite brownie which I enjoyed. What made me mad here was again they skimped on things that were silly. Each of us had a dessert and each was a total disappointment. My parents each had the fruit crumble dessert and one of them got a small portion and the other got 1/4 of what the other got. Anyone who had tiramisu looked like the received half of a small triangle piece - imagine if someone grabbed a fork and took the entire tip off your triangle slice of cake - yeah that.I went in trying to make this a 4 star but the substitutions without notice, the cut corners in random places. They get full marks on taste but lose the rest on value for money and staff.I'd be willing to return and try them out again at full price to see if they're as ""portion conscious"" as they were during Winterlicious, but that won't be for awhile again.",4.0,3.0,65,2016-02-16,43.674554,-79.408984,Mediterranean

Aviv Restaurant,"The owner is very friendly and helpful.  We had to have a quick lunch so we can head back to work so we pre-ordered.  Frank made sure that our meals came in good timing.  Our first time here being Winterlicious.  Had the Risotto balls for starters and it was delicious.  Two balls but good size appetizer.  Very nice and light.The main course was a fresh made pita with two (2) lamb/beef meatballs with sauce and a side of salad.  To be honest, when I first saw it, I was going to ask what happened to the rest of the meatballs because the pita looked so big compared to the meatballs resting in the middle.  BUT, it was the perfect amount since it came with tzatziki to dip the pita in as well.  All the flavours on the meatballs worked out very well together.  The salad was a mixed greens and was a nice side to have. The dessert, I wasn't a fan of mine, apple strudel with ice cream.  I guess that's because my mom would make the best apple strudel.  But it was dessert, so I did eat it (a little more than half of it).  My co-workers had a blueberry cheesecake and a banana bread pudding which they book took to go and we tried it back in the office.  Very good! LOVE the Israeli street signs.  Love the decorations around the place.  Its a pretty cute venue.  I would recommend for you to try it out.",4.0,4.0,65,2017-02-03,43.674554,-79.408984,Mediterranean

A long bar inside with plenty of seating, a fair number of tables and now that warmer temperatures are there a nice covered back patio behind the restaurant. Yay!Most of us were standing around as a variety of menu item faves were passed around by servers. The tacos were fantastic in my opinion, simple in their composition but hearty and generous in portion size. I had a few bites, enough to entice me to return soon, but the fire was lit under my ass by their cocktails! Such perfect execution and totally willing to make adjustments to taste.

The patio is shaded enough to be pleasant in any weather, and if it is warm out, it is as pleasant as any patio you will ever find. The menu has plenty of nice beers, but their bread and butter is tequila and mezcal. Their list is enormous. For me, I'm not going straight, so I went cocktail. Thankfully, they have some nice custom tequila/mezcal based cocktails to choose from, and the tegroni, a negroni with tequila instead of gin, was really well mixed and refreshing. Nice touch. Once the kitchen opened at 6, we also ordered a taco trio with beef. The tacos are small - just enough for a snack - but delicious. Great flavor, great corn shell, and seasoned perfectly.

I wish we were told this sooner, as it would have changed our decision to stay.We settled for the tacos, sold in trios. They weren't that bad but not that fabulous either.

There was also no seating for a group of 5 so we had to dine at the bar in the far corner. Overall, my visit here was not enjoyable if only considering the food. I didn't order any drinks but I am guessing they were good, as they pride themselves in their selection of tequila.

Lee Chen Asian Bistro,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here on a Monday night during out trip to Toronto. I was overall very content with the the ambience, the food, and friendly staff.The restaurant is located below ground level, so we probably would have just passed by it had we not been looking for it. Upon entering, I was surprised to see just how large and spacious it is with very simple, but tasteful, decor. The clean and relaxing environment made it very easy for us to get comfortable as soon as we were seated. We both started with a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. Unfortunately, the drink menu was quite limited with only wine and beer, but luckily, I was very content with the wine I choseIn regards to food, we selected the Soup Filled Pork Dumplings, Pan Fried Pork, Shrimp and Garlic Chive Dumplings, and Sparerib Bites in Rice Powder for appetizers. For our entree we chose the Thai Green Curry Chicken to share.Both the dumplings were FANTASTIC, and the Thai Green Curry was just as good! Between these three dishes, I couldn't decide which I liked the best! The one dish that was a huge disappointment was the Sparerib Bites. We were served a heaping bowl full of bites that looked quite tasty, but after we both consumed the first one, we quickly changed our minds. First of all, they were bone in! In my opinion, a ""bite size"" item that you can just pop in your mouth shouldn't be bone in! If they are going to be, it would have been helpful if it was indicated on the menu. Sadly, it was not. In addition to that, the flavor was really lacking. We were excited to try this unique dish, but it turned out to be our least favorite of the night. We were quick to agree that we wish we hadn't ordered them, and had gotten another side of dumplings instead.All in all, I would still recommend this spot to anyone craving some hot and spicy Asian food. My suggestions: dumplings are a must to start off the meal, and if you are to get the delicious Green Curry, make sure you order a side of rice to help soak in every last spoonful of the curry (the entree does not come with rice). With these appetizers, this entree, and the great setting, you are sure to have a fun and relaxing experience, with some delicious food!",4.0,4.0,66,2017-09-10,43.647369,-79.386763,"Dim Sum , Asian Fusion"

My friends and I ordered a bunch of both fried and steamed dumplings ranging from $6.99 to $7.99 you get about 6-8 dumplings with each order which is a pretty good deal. Our order came out pretty quickly. We ordered the soup dumplings, steamed vegetable dumpling, fried pork dumpling, fried pork and shrimp dumpling and the green onion pancake. Dishes were great. I especially loved the soup dumplings- nice size and very flavourful. The fried dumplings were cooked very nicely. You can't go wrong with the classic fried pork dumplings. However, the steamed vegetable dumplings didn't taste great at all. I've had better vegetable. Service was good and staff were friendly. Overall, a pretty good place to get dumplings and other Asian dishes. Prices are pretty reasonable. Will definitely recommend to others and come back again for delicious soup dumplings!!",4.0,4.0,66,2018-01-05,43.647369,-79.386763,"Dim Sum , Asian Fusion"

Lee Chen Asian Bistro,"This fusion restaurant was really easy to get to from my friend's apartment downtown. We came after a night out during pride for some dim sum, and a little bit of a wake me up. We split a bottle of the of the sake between four of us, and the server would fill a little carafe with the sake, bring it to be heated and then bring it back to our table for us to consume! They were very quick (though it might've been because it wasn't super busy when we were there). All the food we ordered was pretty tasty, although next time I probably wouldn't order a rice based dish. The pork belly was delicious and wish that we had ordered another plate.

Lee Chen Asian Bistro,"Came here on a busy Saturday night. They seated us right away and we got a little booth. The menu is expansive so you really have a ton of choices to suit your tastes at the time. I went with the pork belly bao to start followed by the pan fried pork dumplings. A double dosage of pork, I know, but it was worth the health splurge. The pork belly bao was better than I've had anywhere else. I liked being able to put it together and add as much sauce as I'd like. The dumplings following were also delicious. I wouldn't call them the best dumplings I've ever had but they still got the job done. My friend got a similar mix for their meal and they agreed that the pork belly bao was the best. This place seats a lot of people so it was quite busy and from the time we sat down, there were multiple people that came in and out. The food came out really quickly but I didn't feel rushed to leave which I appreciated. The restaurant was very clean and the service was great. We really enjoyed our meal and I would recommend this place if you're looking for this type of food and want quick service in a comfortable environment.",4.0,5.0,66,2017-09-18,43.647369,-79.386763,"Dim Sum , Asian Fusion"
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,"Wanted to try some dim sum so decided to try this place out. The restaurant is located below ground level in a business building. There was no wait when we got here but the restaurant seems busy with 5-6 table left.The waitress here are very nice and attentive to our needs. The food was good. But I still like dim sum from LA better. We order Xiu Mai, pork dumplings, wonton soup, and pork buns. The xiu mai and pork dumplings tasted very generic just like every other places I've tried. Their wonton soup was just okay. A little bit flavorless, however the pork buns was extraordinary ... they gave us a dish filled with veggies, sauce and pork and a separate plate of buns. You wrap the buns in the spot. Overall good quality was better than average but it wasn't exceptional.",4.0,4.0,66,2017-02-07,43.647369,-79.386763,"Dim Sum , Asian Fusion"
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,"Step into this restaurant on a busy weekday for lunch and you are instantly transformed.   It's on the lower level along King Street and away from the noise. We did not have a reservation. There is a small sign along the street in case you get lost as this restaurant is abit hidden. I have never had my order brought to me so quickly. I had lunch with a co-worker around 13:00pm on a Thursday afternoon. It took about 5-7 minutes before flavourful steaming food came out. I ordered the Kung Pao. Presentation was definitely fusion based hence the theme of  this restaurant. On a white square plate were a large single spring roll, steamed white rice, a small salad and a bowl of sweet and sour spiced chicken. The rice was served in a cute little brown bamboo weaved basket that also had a cover. I noticed that the salad had about three pieces of boiled eggs on top. I did not appreciate that. It's either you put an entire egg or you don't. It seemed odd as it was just three tiny pieces. The salad was iceberg lettuce tossed in a delicious sauce. The flavours I cannot decipher but it reminded me of a Thai peanut sauce despite the white colour. I enjoyed the spring roll. It was steaming hot. Golden and crispy it was stuffed with vegetables such as carrots. I paired this with the packets of plump sauce that was available on the table. The spicy chicken was presented in a rice paper bowl that was edible. It was about 1 1/2 cup of vegetables and chicken in the bowl. The steams made me want to dive in without regard for the hot temperature of the dish. The bowl was crispy on the top. I could not resist breaking a piece off to taste it. The chicken was tender but not spicy at all. It was accompanied with red and green bell peppers that were cut to the same size and white onions. I found a large piece of onion with a piece of the head attached. The vegetables and chicken were steeping in flavourful juices and topped with roasted cashews. They were unsalted. In the end, the bowl sucks up the juices and makes eating the bowl delicious. The star of this dish were the four dried red chillies. I obviously ate all four. Again not spicy at all. Chopsticks were too large. However, they provide a fork in case you can't use them well (quite handy on their part if you ask me). Dressings on the table were the standard soy sauce and chilli oil. I tried the chilli oil on its own and it was not the least bit spicy. I like spicy so I may be bias here. The bill came with fortune cookies of course. They have a lunch special menu which I recommend ordering from as food is alittle on the pricey end here. The lunch special is at the back of the menu. There was a nice calming atmosphere with music playing in the background. I liked that it was the right amount of lighting to give a nice business feel to the place. I liked that the air conditioning temperature was set perfectly as it was a hot day. We were seated immediately upon walking in which is always a bonus. You can always tell alit about a place from the state of the washroom. It was a beautiful washroom that was clean and modern. It goes without saying that the restaurant on a whole was clean, spacious and breathable. I think this is hardly the design for restaurants downtown. This pale cuts it. Overall, this is definitely a place worth trying. Service was good. I would visit again.",4.0,3.0,66,2017-08-11,43.647369,-79.386763,"Dim Sum , Asian Fusion"
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,"It was nice to discover that a new Asian restaurant had opened up close to where I live. I checked out the menu online and was excited to see they had ""xiao long bao"" (soup dumplings) - not easy to find in the downtown core. I visited on a Sunday night with my boyfriend. The restaurant is situated underground along King West and was a lot bigger than I expected. The Asian decor is relatively elaborate. Most of the tables were empty that night and  we were one of the few diners inside. We did, however, see many food delivery couriers come in and out to pick up food throughout the time we were there!The food itself was decent. We ordered the xiao long bao, fried pork dumplings, salt and pepper chicken, and beef noodles. The xiao long bao were well-made and filled with a good amount of soup inside. The fried pork dumplings were good too. The fried salt and pepper chicken was just average and we likely won't order this again. The beef noodles were delicious - flavourful soup, generous amounts of beef, and tasty noodles. We also shared a milk bubble tea - came in a large glass and was pretty good!Overall, we wouldn't hesitate to come back and order some of the same things again.",4.0,3.0,66,2017-01-22,43.647369,-79.386763,"Dim Sum , Asian Fusion"

We ordered 3 orders of the Xiao Long bao, scallion noodles, pan fried dumplings and spare ribs in rice powder. All amazing. Most especially the soup dumplings and scallion noodles. This is the real deal. So glad this place exists. I would go as far as saying it's as good as some of the great dumpling places I've been to in Shanghai. It's a nice restaurant, service is great, food is spot on. This is a great restaurant to have real Chinese food.

The restaurant is worth a try.We tried:Xiao Long Bao: they weren't piping hot just warm so kinda disappointing at the time but it was soft and filled with juice so it was good.Green onion pancake: not bad but needs a bit more flavour. Siu mai: really enjoyed these with the shrimp on top.Pulled pork bao: quite small baos and just decent flavour.Cow mein: was not bad but again needed some extra flavour to make it greatBraised pork belly over rice: again needed something to put it into great territory.",4.0,3.0,66,2017-01-07,43.647369,-79.386763,"Dim Sum , Asian Fusion"
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,"From the outside, it doesn't look like a very big place, but once you walk in, you'll see that it's very spacious inside.Everything looks pretty clean. Washrooms are clean. They've even got small trays of grass in the washrooms which is something you don't see often. Some of the decor is kind of interesting to say the least...* * *We came with a group of 8, and received 5 menus. Well, other chinese places usually just give you 2 menus for a group of 8 so this isn't so bad. It's also a pretty expensive-looking menu compared to sheets of laminated paper with string bindings.Our server briefly walked us through the menu.All sorts of dishes that you would expect at a chinese restaurant: veggie, meats, noodle soups, fried rice/noodle. There are some dimsum dishes as well if you'd like to try some of those on the side.At the back of the menu there are lunch combos that come with white rice, spring roll, and a salad. You can substitute the rice for brown rice, fried rice, or chow mein for an extra $1.5 different bubble teas are available. For dessert you can order passion fruit custard, fried sesame balls, or tang yuan.* * *You don't get free tea. It comes as a drink order for $2.50.However, they give you this massive thermos with a tea bag, which is good for 3 or 4 people. The servers will check up on you from time to time, seeing if you would like re-fills on any beverages. Not sure if they charge extra for re-fills.* * *I ordered the ""Crystal pork belly"" lunch combo, black milk tea with tapioca, and fried sesame balls. The pork belly dish comes with 5 pieces of pork belly inside an edible bowl along with the combo items. It was very tender and juicy, and the soy sauce/sugar flavor wasn't too overpowering. The bubble tea was just ok. It comes in a mug and is about the size of a large cup from other bubble tea places.I liked the fried sesame balls. The inside was quite chewy, with a somewhat crisp exterior.It's a nice place to go if you're looking for a chinese restaurant in downtown core.",4.0,4.0,66,2016-11-18,43.647369,-79.386763,"Dim Sum , Asian Fusion"

Lee Chen Asian Bistro,"As far as Americanized Asian food goes, Lee Chen isn't bad.I was part of a large group at lunch, so I decided to just order from the ""Business Lunch"" menu. A quick perusal quickly brought me to the often-reliable General Tso Chicken (""stir fried w/onion & red chilies in a tangy spicy sauce"").A short time later, the food arrived. The presentation is certainly unique, as the restaurant serves the main dish in a bowl made out of a crispy wonton wrapper (ie the bowl is edible!) The dish also comes with a bowl of rice, a salad, and a spring roll (which was oddly served almost 10 minutes after I received the platter).The food is okay. It comes with a whole mess of red chilies, which are too spicy to eat. But the problem is, the dish is otherwise totally lacking in spice. It's actually pretty bland, to be frank. The small portion only adds insult to injury, but when coupled with the other items on the plate, it's a good amount of food. (The tasteless salad was pretty disastrous, admittedly, but the spring roll was good.)I guess for a quick lunch Lee Chen is fine, but I can't imagine ever returning when there are so many other options in the area.",4.0,3.0,66,2017-04-27,43.647369,-79.386763,"Dim Sum , Asian Fusion"

The Queen And Beaver Public House,"""Sure, Ivan. We can meet at the Queen and Beaver for lunch today"". I said thinking it was probably like one of the firkins. It is definitely not one of the firkins!Classy Victorian atmosphere with some authentic pub charm. I actually felt great just walking in. Ended up going straight upstairs to a wonderful couch and chair seating balanced perfectly between home comfort and out in public wearing a suit and tie. The servers were all very 5 star restaurant professional and warm at the same time. And it is one of those great places where you can show up in a suit and tie or jeans and a t-shirt and feel right at home. Oh and they love their football (soccer for the North Americans) so just fantastic all around. I had the lamb curry and my friend had the daily quiche and a pheasant and ham open face sandwich. Everything looked great and the curry was spicy and excellent. I was very happy that it had no dairy and the server was very careful to make sure it did not. I finished the entire large portion. And my friend happily finished off both of his smaller dishes (which were not so small after all). Price wise it is above a pub and below a classy sit down. My curry was $20.   I enjoyed the Queen and Beaver experience very much and will definitely keep it on file for business or casual lunches or dinners in the future and you should too!",4.0,4.0,319,2017-12-06,43.657443,-79.383357,"Pubs , British"
The Queen And Beaver Public House,"I'm torn about the rating I've given this restaurant. The service was great and the restaurant had a coolness to it with the use of Brittanic kitsch decor. We were attracted to the restaurant after seeing sardines on the online menu. We figured that anyone who serves sardines is ballsy and deserves to be explored. Alas, no sardines were on the menu when we came.Hence the rating conundrum. If you like British cuisine (someone called it ""pub food""), then this is the place for you...and you'd probably give the place five stars. Although the specials sounded fantastic (a veal chop is one I remember), we opted for menu items that we wouldn't find at a typical everyday chop house- pork cheek with white beans and the sweet bread (can't remember the other things that we ordered). Not sure what happened to the white beans but we don't remember them on our plate.So, if British food is your thing, check this place out.",4.0,3.0,319,2017-11-25,43.657443,-79.383357,"Pubs , British"
The Queen And Beaver Public House,"Solid British-style pub with two levels - a more formal dining room on the first floor and far more casual, London-like pub on the second. Like true British pubs, this place isn't solely about the booze - although it does have a good selection of local craft brews. It also has a good offering of solid food that rotates from time to time. For me, a Scotch egg was exactly like I'd had in London, while an entrée of crusted salmon was filling and satisfying.Service at the bar was fairly helpful too, and the overall atmosphere and accessibility of the second floor compared to the ground floor was like day and night.

Just before deciding to go somewhere else, the host offered to save us a table and put our names down. I was really impressed with the service overall here and totally appreciated the host being able to accommodate us. The food was especially delicious! I definitely recommend the duck leg with croquette and curry sauce. Such a satisfying dish... the croquette was nice and crispy on the outside, the curry sauce complemented the duck nicely, and the meat was tender and I could pull it right off the bone. For dessert, I chose to try their homemade salted caramel ice cream. It was the perfect finish to a lovely meal. Thank you so much for accommodating us! An absolutely wonderful meal.

The Queen And Beaver Public House,"I love this place. I was recently in Toronto for the second time and couldn't wait to come back to the upstairs bar. The atmosphere is so comfortable and very relaxing which I enjoy compared to the rest of downtown. It's a British-style pub and that's very obvious with the decor, menu, and even the staff. The bartenders are extremely friendly and happy to have a conversation and to answer any question you might have about the menu. This time around, I enjoyed a Pimms Cup (very refreshing) and a lager (also refreshing). I asked the bartender what would be the better choice between the Fish and Chips and the Shepard's pie and he told me the Fish and Chips were the best you could have outside of England. I wasn't going to say no to that. He was absolutely right. Would highly recommend this dish if you're considering. We came back a second time to the upstairs lounge and decided to try the Hamburgers (they don't serve the full menu upstairs until after 5 I believe). While I enjoyed the Fish and Chips more, this was also an excellent choice. The fries were delicious too. I can't say enough about this place and if you find yourself on this side of downtown, I'd highly recommend stopping by.",4.0,5.0,319,2017-09-18,43.657443,-79.383357,"Pubs , British"
The Queen And Beaver Public House,"This place has been on my list for a few years now - yes, you read right - a few years. A colleague of mine had described it as 'one of the best english pubs in the city'.We went at about 6 pm on a Sunday and we're seated right away at a nice table. The waiter was extremely polite and helpful and the service was excellent! The order: I got the roast dinner which had the roast cooked perfectly, so tender and well seasoned. It came with a delicious Yorkshire pudding, roasted veggies (green beans, carrots, beats, parsnips and potatoes) all doused in a delicious gravy ($28). My wife had the fish and chips - it was one large piece of haddock with a bowl of chips that were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The haddock was well seasoned and had a really nice crunch to the batter. It came with tartar sauce and a really interesting and fun tasting house ketchup with caraway seeds. There was the Heinz ketchup and malt vinegar as well. ($19)The mains were both DELICIOUS and I don't think I could pick a favourite. We were just about to leave when I remembered some other Yelpers talking about the sticky toffee pudding. Oooooooh yes yes yes yes. It was so rich and warm paired with a scoop of in house made ice cream. Oh god it was good. We shared this - I recommended sharing this one as it is quite rich. They didn't have Guinness but offered a junction brewery stout that my wife said tasted like Guinness with espresso (in a good way). Overall.... great service with an excellent meal.

The Queen And Beaver Public House,"This is such a gem in the heart of downtown. The Queen and Beaver is a genuine replica of a proper classic British pub, not a watered-down franchised attempt at it.So believe me when I say that this isn't your typical bar with cheap booze and bad food.Located on Elm St. (a side street just north east of Bay and Dundas), this pub offer small cozy rooms, a front patio and an upper level patio.This is high end food so it will cost you a bit - but it will be worth it.I think the management made a very good choice in breaking down the menu based on the time of the day you visit.The menu changes throughout the day: you will have a brunch, hors d'oeuvres, lunch and supper menu. Also, I really love the idea that each menu, has few options you can choose from that will help you to select what you want to eat within minutes.Wherever there's a short menu I have noticed in all my experiences eating out, that the food is not only fresher, but it's also faster for the chef to cook and to be served (depending how busy a place is) and allows the restaurant to changes some of the items throughout the seasons making each of your visit more interesting because you can expect to find different dishes from time to timeSome of the items though, are a classic and they always be in the menu because it would be almost a crime if you won't have being a pub. I'm talking about dishes like fish and chips or Shepherd's pie. Well my friends, for the old fav pub fare, these items will never change and will be always there.My last visit here, we had their fish and chips, grilled feather steak & tewkesbury mustard, 2 lbs of PEI Mussels steamed in wheat beer, fennel & cream and scotch eggs. All the food came at the same time, within 20 mins from ordering. It was well cooked and of good portions.The drinks? Well, the selection is very good even thought I would like to see more of a 50/50 distribution of choices: a bit more classic English/Scottish beer (like Fuller's, Spitfire, Courage best bitter, Belhaven, or even McEwan's). While the local selection is very good, I think I would remove from the menu the following beers not because they are not good (actually they are), but because they are not local or British (the Queen and Beaver is a British pub in Toronto!):- McAuslan Brewery (Montreal, Quebec)- Sierra Navada, California, USAIn each visit, I found the service to be very good: people working here are very nice, attentive and make you feel comfortable. You can even crack a joke and they will ""follow"" you. Like I said in the opening of the review, The Queen and Beaver is cozy, beautiful pub centrally located that offers an authentic great English pub fare along with a great selection of drinks handled by a capable staff. This is a great spot for a few drinks when you want an intimate atmosphere; or one of those place where you can come for a drink alone with a book, with an old friend for a good chat or even with a group of people.

It's a great space, almost like someone's attic transformed into a large living room with a friendly bartender. We spent several hours there, having drinks, moving to dinner, watching the game and catching up. Our waitress was excellent, getting the feel of the group and largely leaving us alone to our own devices. I had the Bangers and Mash which was hearty and well seasoned.

I ordered their fish and chips and despite not being a huge fan of this iconic British dish, i LOVED it. The large filet of white fish was fried to a perfect flakiness. My favourite part was by far the batter: the lightness of the batter just made me crave for more batter on the fish, which is unheard of. It was just that good! The large piece of fish came with a side of chips, lightly seasoned with salt as well as a homemade ketchup and a homemade tartare sauce (once again, amazing and not heavy at all).Prices for cocktails are slightly above average, ranging between $10 and $15, beers as well.

After going over the menu, my friend decided to get their haddock and chips, a well known traditional food in United Kingdom. And I had my mind set on the salmon and watercress pesto wellington. After around 30-40 mins, our food finally arrived! (Thank god we had beer  while the wait) The haddock was beautifully done, crispy outside juicy inside. Loved their fries on the side as well.

My husband and I were starving and the restaurant was only offering its pub menu at the time, but we thought the choices would be adequate. After reading other Yelp reviews ahead of time, we first went upstairs to sit, but it was very busy, so we decided to go back downstairs to sit. We sat at the downstairs bar, which was empty besides the servers and us at the time. Personally, I found the quieter downstairs area much nicer than upstairs. The servers were also very pleasant. I had the mushroom pithivier, which came out looking like a slice of cake with some salad. The pithivier consisted of lots of layers of thinly sliced potato, a layer of mushroom and some melted cheese, and a layer of puff pastry. It was tasty, but overpriced at $22. My husband's full-size mussels dish was $21 in comparison, which seemed much more reasonable. It was very odd my vegetarian dish cost more than his did, especially when he had seafood, which can be a little pricey. I gobbled up the pithivier and salad greens in no time, and helped myself to some of the fries that also came with my husband's order. Maybe other dishes are more fairly priced, but the pithivier was the only meatless option that wasn't an appetizer/snack. As charming as the atmosphere was, we were underwhelmed by our first Toronto meal, and left feeling like we'd overpaid.",4.0,3.0,319,2017-03-22,43.657443,-79.383357,"Pubs , British"
The Queen And Beaver Public House,The Queen and Beaver became my favorite haunt during a two-night stay in Toronto. I ended up coming here THREE times - once for breakfast and twice for late-night drinks. The food is deliciously authentic and I loved the chill vibes of the upstairs lounge and terrace seating. I'm surprised this establishment hasn't been swarmed by hipsters yet. If I lived in Toronto I'd be a frequent patron.

Soco Kitchen and Bar,"Taste: 3Service: 4Value: 3Presentation: 4Overall: 3.5 rounded up to 4Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. Trying out the steak and frites today. My coworker told me they serve godlike fries, possibly her favourite fries of all time. My dish comes with the soco fries so I'm excited to try them.Wow the portion sizes were huge! At least my coworkers' dishes were. I had my 7oz steak but my plate had a lot of fries on it. Trying out the steak, immediately I could tell that it would be disappointing. It wasn't cooked well at all and didn't even taste like steak. But moving onto the feature (lol?), these soco fries were crispy with garlic, parmesan, chopped herbs and caper aioli sprinkled on top. And if that wasn't enough for you, they provide you with a creamy garlic sauce to dip your fries in mmmmmmm! I personally prefer my fries slightly crispier, but I would stand by my coworker's claim that these are the best fries given that. Regardless though, the flavour packed into these fries were utterly addicting. Disclaimer: if you are a vampire I am not responsible for any injury as a result of trying these delicious fries.The service was pretty good throughout our meal. Food came relatively quickly and waiter came periodically to give us refill on water and ask for refills of beer. No complaints there.Now in terms of the value, $26 for steak and fries is quite cheap by Toronto's standards. So, I wasn't extremely surprised by the quality of the steak when it arrived. The portion sizes were huge though and I was quite stuffed. On the other hand, if you only want to try their fries, it's only $7 for an order which is a little bit on the pricier side but well justifies the price in my opinion.In conclusion, don't let the fact that this restaurant is located in a hotel discourage you. I had a great meal here and would be excited to come back for their fries every so often. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier.

Soco Kitchen and Bar,"Soco Kitchen and Bar is a small restaurant with a sports bar feel on the ground floor of the Delta hotel in the Toronto financial district. I've been here a few times now, half for business lunches and half on my own. I've always found it easy to get a table for one or a group of four. For larger groups, it's best to call ahead to reserve.My first visit was a team lunch the past summer. I had a black cod dish that I thought would be similar to what you'd get at a Japanese restaurant. It was not. I was also disappointed with the flavor.Recently, I decided to give Soco another try because it was freezing outside and I didn't want food court food. I was interested in pasta, so I ordered the duck bolognese. It was fantastic, and I ordered it again on repeat visits. You can taste that the pappardelle pasta is freshly made. The ground duck is savory and delicious. I couldn't tell that it was duck. It includes a scoop of cold ricotta, which goes so well with the pasta. Getting a taste of ricotta, pasta, and ground duck in every bite is pure heaven.On one of my last visits, I also ordered the mushroom soup. It had a very earthy flavor to it. At the bottom was a sliver of portobello mushroom and two quarters of a button or cremini mushroom. The soup is garnished with freshly ground black peppercorns. I enjoyed it.",3.0,4.0,130,2018-01-26,43.642653,-79.383847,"Bars , Canadian (New)"

Soco Kitchen and Bar,"There is a lot to like about SOCO. Normally I tend to stay away from restaurants that are adjacent to hotels since they usually overcharge for mediocre food, but I am glad to say SOCO does not fit into that mould.We came here on a Wednesday night and the place was packed and lively, which speaks volumes in itself. The interior here is modern and very much fits with the business casual crowds that streams here for post-work food and drinks.Executive chef Keith Pears (winner of Chopped Canada!), and sous chef Micheal Hawryluk are doing a fantastic job with the menu here, as is pastry chef Engin Tiryaki. The food here has minor creative elements to it that adds to the dish while keeping them familiar and approachable.We had a sampling of various dishes for the night, some highlights include:- Grilled Striploin with twice baked potato, watercress salad and mushroom ketchup (great dish for $34)- Duck confit (Absolutely delicious)- Prawn tagliatelle (hearty pasta that would please anyone)- Delta whiskey caramel chocolate cake (so good that I didn't want to share!)- Apple bites (another fantastic dessert)Service throughout the night was at a reasonable pace for a very busy restaurant.Overall, I find the pricing here very reasonable considering the quality and taste of the food, and I find it extremely comparable with other downtown Toronto restaurants.

Soco Kitchen and Bar,"Stellar service and great food made this an all round excellent dining experience. A came here with a girlfriend who was visiting from the east coast. We decided to split an appetizer, the calamari - sooo good! It was grilled to perfection. We both enjoyed it. For entrees, we wanted to share so I ordered to the duck confit (at the recommendation of our server, Evan) and she ordered the bouillabaisse. We were both huge fans of the duck! I'm not typically a duck fan so that was a great surprise. The skin was crunchy and the meat very moist, not fatty at all. The bouillabaisse was our least fav dish. While the Arctic char was prepared beautifully and the other seafood cooked nicely, the sauce left nothing to be desired. It felt like it was missing a kick so to speak. All and all though, it was a terrific dining experience. I would go back for sure. I highly recommend you try the calamari and/or duck.

The service was great, the rooftop itself has a gorgeous, unique view of the surrounding area, and the couch/cabana seating is nice and spaced out. It is probably the most spacious roof tops one could linger on. They could probably toss a few goats up there and a donkey for good measure.Definitely a sophisticated, older more mature crowd at the event I went to. I can't speak to what the usual sort of patrons would be, but I am guessing overall a classy place to go chill.

Soco Kitchen and Bar,"Sorry, no pictures this time. We were too hungry to take pictures before eating. If you want to skip the details, I'll first say the food is good, the service is average, but it's a little overpriced.I wouldn't really recommend this place for dinner, but for appetizers definitely. To share, we ordered the 5 cheese Mac and cheese, garlic fries, calamari, meatballs, and Brussels sprouts. The Mac and cheese was decent, fries were crisp and the meatballs were average. The calamari was a bit disappointing. It wasn't fried, but cooked and served with this chick pea and tomato paste. The Brussels sprouts however, were amazing. Much better than I thought. The outer layer tastes like kale chips, and it's served with what I can only assume is mayonnaise.The dinner options were much more limited, I just opted for a burger while my friends ordered pastas and steaks. Again, I wouldn't recommend going for dinner. While the food did taste good, it was overpriced for what you were getting. In addition, service was slow and it took a long time to get our food. Also, I was a bit off put by the fact that for groups of 8+ they automatically add a tip of 18% AFTER tax (we were informed halfway through service).I would come back, but probably only for the Brussels sprouts and fries.",3.0,3.0,130,2017-10-29,43.642653,-79.383847,"Bars , Canadian (New)"

It was pretty big, had about 8 slices - you can finish it if you're really hungry or take the rest home (although I don't recommend it as there is some balsamic vinegar that makes the flatbread soggy if left uneaten for a long time). Would have given 3 stars but the service was absolutely terrible. There is a mandatory gratuity for groups over 8 people.

The Arancini had mushrooms and melted cheese inside, with a crisp outer shell. They were delicious, 4 for $10. The mac n cheese, also delicious, made with fresh delicious cheese and a special blend of herbs was only $5 for a small bowl, easily shared between two people. For the mains we kept it simple. Got the SOCO burger, which has smoked bacon and a delicious jam type ketchup. Paired with skinny fries (comparable to McDonalds cut, sans all the sodium). They came with a garlic, caper aioli dipping sauce to die for! Def worth a try. The burger itself was very fresh, made from minced meat, perhaps hand made? It would crumble as I was eating it.

Soco Kitchen and Bar,"I came here on a Saturday evening for a friend's birthday.  Soco is located inside the Delta Toronto hotel on Lower Simcoe but the street entrance is on the Brenmer Blvd side.  Being part of the building of 75 Simcoe and being the main restaurant in the hotel you can also access the restaurant from the hotel lobby.Soco has a couple seating areas, one facing Brenmer, an outdoor section which is seasonal and the main dining area which consists of the bar, lounge area with long couch seating as well as low and high top tables.  We were seating adjacent to the lounge area with attached tables and although the seats were pretty much touching one another, the seating was very comfortable and the chairs are wide so that it created ""buffer"" space simply by being as wide as they were.  The tables were large enough for all our drinks and the wide variety of starters we had coming our way one after another while Alex our server had our drinks well taken care of.  At one point I had just finished my drink and Alex came by like a ninja and asked me if I'd like another.  I was so surprised I almost had trouble saying yes.The variety of starters we sampled were all very good.  The cheese and crostini was first with a variety of soft and hard cheeses it was a nice sized starter for sharing.  Next came the Mezze which was another share plate which consisted of a smoked pepper and ricotta dip and a spicy chickpea hummus with a generous bowl of olives and a side of warm flat bread.  The hummus tasted great and wasn't too spicy.  The pepper and ricotta dip although it had a tiny kick it also was not hot and overly spicy but rather a very nice definitive taste.  The charcuterie had a nice variety of salami and mustard seed and toast.  While the toast was good I preferred the warm flatbread that came with the dips.My wife had wanted to try the corn chowder because it's one of her favorite soups.  The bowl came empty with a few kernels of popcorn in the bowl with some cilantro leaves and the soup was poured from a decanter into the bowl in front of her.  The soup had an amazing taste of mildly sweet corn but with the smallest of late spice kick of jalapeno peppers.  This dish was not too hot for my wife and she normally cannot handle hot at all and it was perfect for her.  The soup is more of a thinner consistency but the taste is great.  There are small cubes of chorizo to add another flavor to the mix of soup as well so it's sweet and savory with a hint of spice to finish.  Amazing flavor for the corn chowder soup...My wife had ordered the lobster tagliatelle as her main but because she ate so many starters she basically barely touched it.  I tasted it and it was rich with that lobster while the pasta dish itself is not something I have very often considering I don't eat lobster that often.  It now is today's lunch for me.  For my main I went with the steak, medium rare.  I enjoy a good steak from time to time and this was cooked medium rare as requested, not overcooked and a good size.  The potatoes that accompanied the fine cut had a chimichurri sauce but I had wished it had more.  It was very light to the point I didn't get too much of a taste of it.  The mustard and herb butter compound on the steak added another level of taste to the steak.  As it melted it added a nice tang to the meat that wasn't too lubricated but rather nice with the potatoes and asparagus as well.   On the side I couldn't resist ordering the 5 cheese mac and cheese and adding the braised beef option to it.  The mac and cheese came in a what looked to be about a 2 cup sized bowl topped with bread crumbs.  On the menu this mac and cheese dish is listed as a side and it's also listed as the 2015 and 2016 Toronto Mac & Cheese best of festival champion.  I'm sorry to say I think those descriptions raised the bar for my expectations in that I was expecting to be blown away and I just was not.  The mac and cheese for me seemed rather runny and a touch sweet.  I prefer savory and rich mac and cheese over this offering.  The braised beef added a dimension of change of texture and flavor of course but not enough to counter the sweetness of the sauce.  While it was nice to try I wouldn't recommend it to those expecting a saltier, richer and more savory mac and cheese.  Overall the presentation, quality and service of Soco is very good, not quite mind blowing 5* but definitely better than average for their variety and tastes.  Nothing seemed overly bold but nothing was sadly tame either.  The service we received was exceptional as the staff couldn't seem to do enough for us.",3.0,4.0,130,2016-11-07,43.642653,-79.383847,"Bars , Canadian (New)"

We shared the Meze platter, which came with pita with hummus as well as some smoky cheese dip, plus some olives. This was pretty tasty. I also had some of my cousin's burger and it was tasty which makes me think you should just stick with the food here, NOT their drinks (even though 'bar' is in their name).

Campo,"3.5 stars A definite nice local spot in the west end of the Toronto.  I would say that most people dont realize a good restaurant is here as there's very little near it other than Toronto urban suburbs.  The locals definitely know about it as it was pretty packed on a random Thursday evening at 8 pm.This quaint place focuses on a small and refined Italian menu that only has 1 or 2 dishes per type (salad, appetizer, primi pasta, and entree).  I do recommend to grab a reservation as the restaurant is equally as small.  There are maybe 10 to 14 tables with most being 2 seating only.  I would say that you are definitely snug here... If there is a loud couple, you will hear them ... A LOT.  If anything, I would say its a big draw back.  The acoustics make this more of a loud bar like atmosphere instead of a romantic intimate space.  We had one couple that just made it near impossible to have a conversation.  We were across the restaurant from them.  I cannot imagine what it is like to sit only 6 inches away from them.  Arugula salad - Possibly the best dish of the night.  Flavourful and lightly dressed that balances the nice natural sweetness of the peaches.  I liked the addition of the crunchy almonds that give it a nice nutty note and a good texture to the crisp lettuce.  4/5Cauliflower soup - Their daily offering was a cauliflower soup with a bit of smoked fish added.  The smoked fish was a nice touch and really help elevate the flavour overall... otherwise it would have been pretty bland.  3.5/5Gnocchi - I've had a few excellent gnocchi in Italy recently and this gnocchi was executed well.  Bite sized fluffy and light without being too chewy or doughy.  I really enjoyed the dumplings.  The sauce is a bright gleaming red but it was a bit too light on actual flavour.  I would have loved a bit more spice to it.  3.5/5Meatball & Polenta - Meaty and large in portion, this is a hefty dish.  It looks deceivingly light but the meatballs are dense and larger than a golfball.  It feels more like a small burger patty than anything.  Though generous in nature, I found the meatball touch dry and chewier.  The polenta was very smooth and creamy... definitely could have used more of the tomato sauce to give is a flavour lift. 3.5/5Tiramisu - A very interesting take as it does an open tiramisu where the savoiardi cookies were left relatively untouched and unsoaked between the filling.  It had a nice balance between the crunchy cookie and the creamy filling and a good kick of coffee to flavour it.  It wasn't large so it be a nice ending to the meal.  3.5/5For the price, I did find it on the more expensive side and approaching the same prices I found in the best places in Toronto.  It didnt hit the same tastes or flavours as those places.  Though everything here is good, I wouldnt necessarily trek back here for a return visit.",4.0,3.0,37,2017-09-25,43.655118,-79.486959,"Spanish , Italian"
Campo,"Interesting place on the west end. Came here for dinner and we ordered a the Arugula Salad and a Seafood Pasta. I believe they change their menu often because I don't see some of the dish in review pictures. Arugula Salad is soooo good. Definitely one of the best salads I've ever had. However, the pasta was under cooked and was quite hard. I had to ask the chef to take it back and cook a bit more. Overall I think for the price I was paying, I might not go back.",4.0,3.0,37,2017-09-22,43.655118,-79.486959,"Spanish , Italian"
Campo,"Carefully thought out menus, perfectly balanced dishes and a wonderful staff make this a true gem in Bloor West. The restaurant is quaint and tastefully decorated, feeling more like a European find than a west Toronto eatery The Italian and Spanish style dishes are paired with a fantastic selection of reds, whites, unique beers and beautifully crafted cocktails. The dishes are well portioned and thoughtfully plated. We decided to go outside of our box and order the toasted country bread: Sobrasada, manchego cheese and topped with a white anchovy. The saltiness of the anchovy worked perfectly with the Sobrasada, definitely worth the try! Do not dare to skip the dessert. The salted caramel pudding was unreal, and the tiramisu was a great way to top off a wonderful night out!",4.0,5.0,37,2017-09-23,43.655118,-79.486959,"Spanish , Italian"

It was almost pure bourbon which I don't mind, but it wasn't the best old fashioned I've ever had. My wife's wine was good too.We probably won't be back for dinner but I suggest checking it out.

We got the toast and cauliflower salad to start- incredible, followed by the seafood and chorizo pasta and one of the specials, a beef cheek spaghetti-- absolutely delicious.

Campo,"Even though Campo is dangerously close to my house, I had been avoiding it for awhile, not sure if it had improved from its predecessor, Camp.  A friend suggested to try it for a catch up dinner and I was over all impressed.We made reservations for 7:15pm and were seated right away at a table for two in the cozy dining room.  From the daily menu, we chose to start off with appetizers - roasted cauliflower salad ($13), lobster and shrimp salad ($15) and selection of olives ($4).  We also ordered  glasses of the red and white house wines ($10).   The cauliflower salad was amazing...a generous portion dressed in an addictive vinaigrette, and very timely as my Facebook feed that day had been littered with posts about $5 heads of cauliflower. Lobster and shrimp salad also very fresh and tasty.  I was pretty stuffed after the 2 salad so we decided to split a main - daily fish with white beans and kale ($27).  Fish was nicely cooked with a crispy skin and the beans/kale were an appropriate accompaniment.We thought about skipping dessert but glad we didn't when we dug into salted caramel budino ($6).  Heavenly caramel pudding with whipped cream and crispy peanuts.  Almost considered ordering a portion to myself.Service throughout dinner was very attentive with appropriate water glass filling.  I was still reeling from our horrible service at Ruby Watcho the week previous so it was great to be gently brought back to a great dining experience with kind service.Looking forward to coming back to Campo for a brunch in the near future.",4.0,4.0,37,2016-01-25,43.655118,-79.486959,"Spanish , Italian"
Campo,Ate there Saturday night - 8:30pm reservation - ate at the bar. Very friendly staff - busy vibe - small restaurant. Bright fun atmosphere. Food - ordered the orecchiette - with shrimp and chorizo. You'd expect that the pasta might have some shrimp and chorizo in it? This restaurant should be embarrassed by what they served - deeply embarrassed. It was as if they took 1 small shrimp and 1 slice of chorizo - and then diced them up into tiny little pieces. It was barely noticeable. Never have I ordered a shrimp and chorizo pasta with such a skimpy cheap portion of ingredients! Bland - boring - bad.My friend ordered the salmon. It was overdone. Over cooked. The place gets good reviews and maybe it was an off night. But it was a disappointment.,4.0,2.0,37,2016-05-09,43.655118,-79.486959,"Spanish , Italian"

Campo,"Campo is that great local spot that has managed (for good or bad) to fly under the radar. The reason for this is likely due to its obscure location between Bloor and Annette Streets on Jane.If you have never been here, you should. Main entrees are priced in the 19-29$ range; appetizers are in the 8-15$ range.The menu is small. It features a couple of very delicious salads, a chicken-liver spread that is very good, and basically a chicken dish, lamb gnocchi, strip loin, and a fish dish. My table enjoyed the strip loin and the gnocchi. They were superb.The restaurant is small, so reservations are probably needed on weekends. They do have bar and table seating with a couple of draught beers and an ample wine selection.The only real miss here is the service. It is basically good, though somewhat frantic. While this can be overlooked, they miss opportunities to do things like offer to take your coat, offer fresh pepper or Parmesan at your table, automatically bring bread/water, or introduce you to the chef/owner in hopes of building a ""we'll be back regularly"" kind of clientele. They are small enough to make everyone feel like a very special guest, yet come up just a bit short in this regard.",4.0,4.0,37,2015-03-16,43.655118,-79.486959,"Spanish , Italian"

We were in lying one of two tables seated and it was still impressively slow service. The little annoying things like bringing a dessert menu but never coming back to actually ask for our order from it. Coming to fill water glasses and only filling one person's. The food seemed pretty overpriced for what it was. The salad was great, but my gnocchi was half decent, and half really undercooked and basically dough. A nice fresh tomato sauce, but again, pretty pricey for what it is.

The Wren,"It was a regular Wednesday night in the big city. After going for drinks, my friend and I were hungry. This place was on social media and we were both curious. We drove down the Danforth and spent about 20 minutes going back and forth looking for parking. There was ZERO on-street parking available. We drove down to the nearest green p lost which was kinda far. It was about a 15 minute walk. We walked in to a very small bumping restaurant, bar stools were taken by upbeat folks and the back was loud and busy. We waited about 20 minutes for a table, while waiting we ordered a drink at the bar. Bar service was good. My only compliant was it was very squished. Finally we got called to our table. A squished seat in between 2 other couples on a picnic bench. We ordered the Guac and Chips which were average. My friend and I were here to try the Uncle Buck Burger; charred beef burger, with onions rings, pickles, thousand island dressing, bbq sauce and bacon. Sounds great right? It looked and sounded delicious. I was down! The fries were also delicious; crispy the way I like it. My only compliant about the burger is the meat lacked some flavour and it was too charred for my liking. The toppings worked well. What I didn't like is my overall experience; the seating, the small space, the no parking. Keep Eating, Angela",4.0,3.0,150,2018-01-20,43.68241,-79.32805,"Bars , American (Traditional)"
The Wren,Weird little place... Entering the place at about 3:50 on a Sunday afternoon my girlfriend and I were met with a blank stare from the barman before he coughed out a greeting that included the kitchen was closed from 3-4 but should be opening soon. We sat and waited on service hoping to at least have a drink while we waited on food... We waited and watched as the barman read the paper and completely ignored us. Finally we went to the bar and ordered for ourselves. At 4 I guess there was a shift change and a waitress came by to take our food order... Another deer in the headlights gaze... Figuring we weren't going to stay long we ordered some buffalo cauliflower to pick at while we finished our drinks... Arrived pretty quickly but mushy and overcooked.

The Wren,"Every time I've been to The Wren it's been for either a tap takeover or part of a pub/bar crawl.  I recently found myself there for yet another tap takeover, so I figure it's about time I reviewed the venue.  The Wren is small and not particularly upscale (except for the washroom).  It does, however, boast both a great beer selection and great food.  It's also in a convenient location, being not too far east of Greenwood subway station and also nearby a number of other bars, etc.As I've only been to the venue for the aforementioned special Events, it's always been or became quite crowded while I was there but I can't recall service - either at the bar or tables - having ever been quite negatively impacted as a result.  Due to its size, I don't recommend The Wren for large(r) Groups unless you can snag at least 1 of the picnic tables in the center of their seating area.  The noise level, predictably does become quite high when the place is pretty crowded.I definitely recommend The Wren if you haven't been and find yourself in the neighbourhood.",4.0,5.0,150,2017-03-08,43.68241,-79.32805,"Bars , American (Traditional)"

The Wren,"I wanted to really like The Wren, I really did. But I gotta say, in between the mouthwatering beer offerings, the much raved grub, and the beaten-to-death laminated food menu, service can be.. uh.. spotty.Always popular, always packed is a common theme for this Danforth diner since it opened. And it was even featured on ""You Gotta Eat Here"" on the Canadian Food Network. It's only now that I have gotten a chance to come and snag a seat and see for myself why I gotta eat here.But I gotta say, it seems the level of service afforded to you depends where you sit. Of course you are unmissable sitting at the bar. It's when you are at the front window when staff attention drops to nearly zero. Amongst the chaos of an average Friday evening, where people do queue up inside for an open table, they actually thought for more than 10 minutes I was waiting for other people, no wonder I was menu-less for so long! It wasn't just me struggling for a server--a couple beside me took a few tries to snag someone so they can get some food finally. Maybe they need to zone out their space, I dunno--several staff were playing host, it was all over the place.The 'Uncle Buck Burger' ($16) I settled for was stacked with a large beer battered onion ring, which had this interesting smoky caramel flavour to it. A bitty bit of Thousand Islands dressing added, it was not very effective. It was alright, not as mindexpanding as anticipated but bit of a beast to eat, and comes with some very crispy crisp fries.The Wren has a varied patron base of different age groups reflective of one big part of the Danforth community... and maybe a few greasy foodies thrown in there somewhere. They may have a reputation for interesting grilled comfort foods, but still needs to work on handling a busy night effectively, lest I feel like a true poltergeist.{TTC: around the corner from Greenwood subway station}",4.0,3.0,150,2017-05-02,43.68241,-79.32805,"Bars , American (Traditional)"
The Wren,"The various burger offerings at The Wren seem to be constantly highlighted on Instagram, so it was just a matter of time before I found myself sitting down for a meal.(Ironically, I didn't even order a burger.)We arrived just before noon on a Saturday and the place was already bustling. After sitting down at one of the last free tables, I perused the menu and quickly decided to order the Brisket Hash (""shredded beef brisket, potato, onion, and seasonal vegetables. Served with warm cornbread & two sunny side up eggs"").It's a good dish, although it saddens me to say that it was not served hot. It was barely room temperature when I received it, and this continues to be one of my biggest pet peeves at restaurants. (Seriously, how difficult is it to serve a hot meal hot?)Anyway, the food is otherwise very tasty. The hash is quite flavorful and packed with tasty elements, although the beef brisket itself was a little on the sparse side. (I quite enjoyed the innovation of using french fries in place of potatoes, which gave the whole thing a kind of poutine-like feel.) The cornbread is decent, especially for Toronto. (I don't think I've ever had cornbread in the city that even comes close to the stuff you get in the States.)I should also mention that the service was fairly subpar, as my dining companion's water glass sat empty for more than half the meal.",4.0,3.0,150,2017-05-28,43.68241,-79.32805,"Bars , American (Traditional)"
The Wren,Good little spot.  We were there on a very cold night.  We arrived with a party of 4 and were told there was room in the middle of one of the bench seats.  We opted to wait the promised 10 - 15 minutes.  We were offered drinks and started to wait.  More and more groups showed up and it got very busy in the waiting area.  There was a table at the back of the restaurant that we asked about after we'd waited 20 minutes and  were told it was for groups of 5 or more... we were 4. After a long wait we got our table right beside the big table at the back.  The big table sat empty as we ate our dinner.  The food was good pub food and it was a cozy spot.  I was personally really frustrated with the wait and would have been more frustrated if a group of 5 had shown up to be seated before us after waiting the half hour plus for a table.  I would not rush back to the The Wren as I did my think it was anything special.,4.0,3.0,150,2018-01-12,43.68241,-79.32805,"Bars , American (Traditional)"

The Wren,"Finding myself on a rarely made trip to the east end, I decided to make a stop in to the Wren as this place has been intriguing me for a while.One thing that was surprising on arrival is how small the room actually is. Pictures online make it seem bigger, so I was a bit surprised to arriving around 6pm and the place already being full with a waiting list for a table. Luckily there was room at the bar for me to saddle up alongside.This place was on my radar as it's been known for it's craft beer selection, and on that front it did not disappoint at all. They had about a dozen craft options including options from great Ontario brewers such as Indie Ale House, GLB, Bellwoods, Side Launch, and Redline to name a few. Beers range in 12, 14, or 16 oz pours depending on what you fancy.Foodwise, I ordered the Uncle Buck Burger which is their premium burger topped with a friend onion ring and some bacon and white cheddar cheese amongst other things. On first look, I thought this was going to be the best burger I've had in ages. It had plate appeal, juicy meat and some decent looking fries on the side. It was a good burger, but admittedly I'm not sure if it was the thousand island dressing (which I normally am down with), but something just seemed a bit off in its flavour. It was still enjoyable, but fell a bit short which is the sole reason I've got to stick with a 4 star review.But the place is quaint and cute and the service is friendly.

I ordered the Great Lakes pickeral and had the apple terrine for dessert.The birch and sunchoke ice cream was PHENOMENAL and would return just for that! Service was amazing as well.

Canoe,"My first time at Canoe was two years ago and I was a big fan of the view but not the food. More recently, I came for winterlicious 2018 and thought the food was much better than it was two years ago. I started with the poached salmon which was surprisingly large in portion and went really well with the mustard. My friend had their foie gras and I thought it went nicely with the berry sauce. I then had the beef short rib and thought that was good but not exceptional. For dessert, I had the poached pear, which came with a spicy sauce. It was good but wish I had gotten the trifle instead. They were really busy but service could be better. Our mains took a really long time to get to us and we saw others that came in before us get served first. We also found an eyelash in the food and they dealt with it professionally.",4.0,4.0,552,2018-01-28,43.646954,-79.382159,Canadian (New)
Canoe,"Made a reservation but still had to wait maybe 10 to 15 minutes for a table, despite being after the lunch rush. A bit pricey for lunch, but it's expected for a dining experience of this caliber.Service: Waiter was fairly attentive, although it took a while to take our orders. Was seated near a window, as requested when I made my reservation. View would definitely be nicer during the summer months. The waiter/waitress that brought each dish would explain what I was eating, a very nice touch!Food: This was definitely more than just food, it was a dining experience. The complimentary in-house made bread with tomato puree humus was very fresh, as the bread was still warm. The maple cured salmon + fogo island crab appetizer was very rich, with the taste of creamy avocado and salmon tartare, but only very small portion of crab. The braised tamarack lamb was so tender it could be cut with a fork, although it was a little on the salty side. Each dish was also plated very beautifully, almost like artwork.Overall: Amazing dining experience with a view, but make a reservation before-hand and kindly ask for a table with a view. Also, coat check is done before walking into the dining area.",4.0,4.0,552,2018-01-14,43.646954,-79.382159,Canadian (New)
Canoe,"Note that I didn't actually eat at Canoe but this is my experience making a reservation for Winterlicious 2018. Canoe may be the one restaurant that I constantly get raving recommendations on their exquisite food, but unfortunately my first encounter with them was extremely unpleasant. I called to make a reservation, and was content if I couldn't get a table because I know how popular Canoe is. However the receptionist on the phone was either unprofessional, unhelpful, or hates her job. It was like pulling teeth when I tried to get information from her, and she did not sounded like she cared or tried to offer any solutions to solve a problem. I also didn't get a reservation at another Winterlicious restaurant, but the receptionist there was welcoming, made sure I was informed, and tried to provide a solution to my problem. It seems like people that visit Canoe during their usual occasions receive great services, and not so much when it comes to Winterlicious/Summerlicious. If that is the case, Canoe, you would be much better off not participating in these events and save the time of your customers from going through these horrible experiences. If my first encounter with a restaurant already leaves such a bad taste afterwards, I am very reserved on whether I would be visiting this place at all, regardless of how exquisite their food is.",4.0,1.0,552,2018-01-11,43.646954,-79.382159,Canadian (New)

Canoe,"Based on Summerlicious, I found my new special occasion spot. Beautifully decorated with a huge sitting space and an amazing view of Toronto, this place serves contemporary food.However, service could be better. They start with bread and hummus (they called roasted chickpea something), and they will refill it if you ask for.  Drinks selection was pretty good, particularly cocktails.Funnel Pickled salad to start with, was a perfect combination of fresh crisp veggies, sweet and sourness. For mains I ordered Risoni Risotto, they were delicious, perfectly cooked. For desserts, I and my hubby shared a Summer berry crumble & Flourless chocolate cake, both were delicious with generous portions. The ambience is really romantic and the view from 54th floor is gorgeous.My husband ordered Foie Gras Parfait for starters, Ontario braised lamb shoulder for mains. He loved both of them, mains, in particular, the juicy tender lamb with distinctive flavours, well cooked.The only thing we were not impressed was, service, proper attention was not paid to us, we had to call our server many times for water or cutlery, we would have preferred a little more interactive server.But Yeah, I am visiting them again, may be we get a better server this time.We parked at 145 king, a reasonable parking nearby.",4.0,4.0,552,2017-08-02,43.646954,-79.382159,Canadian (New)
Canoe,Came here for summerlicious.  Was another great experience.  I got the smoke salmon salad as appetizer and it's so far the best dish I have had this summerlicious.  The salmon was soft and tasted good.  The veggies and sauces added many different flavours to the dish and went well with the salmon. For main I got the tuna dish. Overall I thought the dish was average.  The tuna was more over cooked than I would like.  Also it had a strong fishy taste too it. The other components to the dish was good but nothing stood out.For dessert I got the berry crumble.  I liked the crumbles and there was a good amount of berries.  Didn't like the liquid was in the bottom of the jar. After mixing the liquid with the crumble the dish started looking unappetizing.,4.0,4.0,552,2017-07-21,43.646954,-79.382159,Canadian (New)
Canoe,"Licking my fingers just reminiscing about the buttery Quebec foie gras that I just had for dinner at Canoe Summerlicious 2017. The yuzu, ginger crumble and stone fruit were the perfect accompaniment to this sublime and unique dish.As always, Canoe Restaurant is top notch, fantastic and possibly one of the best restaurants in Canada.  It totally deserves all its critical acclaims and merits.Canoe always has been my IT destination for licious despite the reservations are so hard to make (dialing 300 times or being on hold for one hour) but it was totally worth it in the end. I highly recommend to go there if you have never experience this excellent restaurant before.The restaurant provides top notch professional service and high quality dishes  using  Canadian local ingredients.

Canoe,"3.5/5 Disclaimer: Solely based off the Summerlicious dinner menu. This is my first summerlicious experience so was surprised when I managed to land a reservation (for two). Came around 6 pm and was seated without any issues. Its too bad we didn't get a window seat because the view is truly phenomenal. As for the food, it was decent but I expected to be blown away given the prestige of Canoe. The fois gras (app) was my favourite of the set, with the caramel and ginger crumble giving a nice light touch. The strip loin (main) was cooked perfectly (med rare) but lacked flavor. The cheek was a tad dry but at least the side vegetables tasted alright if that's anything. The mint chocolate torte (dessert) looked way too sweet for my liking, but it actually tasted alright. Wish the portions were a bit bigger overall. Definitely picture worthy, wish it was more food worthy.

Canoe,"I have mixed feelings about Canoe. It's the darling of the Financial District; a ""must-go-to-if-you-haven't"" and as such a common choice for business meetings, team dinners, etc. for those on Bay Street and in the vicinity.The first time I went to Canoe it was for Summerlicious (dinner). I would not recommend this having recently gone for a (regular) lunch and had a far superior experience. Perhaps it was my choices (duck terrine appetizer, steak as a main, and I believe cheesecake-esque dessert) but nothing apart from the dessert was particularly memorable. The terrine was a bit dry and the steak somewhat rubbery and more fatty than I'd expect. Dessert was great - light, picturesque, sweet but not overly so.Lunch a few weeks ago was an entirely different story - I ordered a pasta special (it was tagliatelle with a lamb ragu). Superb - absolutely wonderful. Such rich flavours, and a goat cheese layer on top that paired beautifully with the meat and pasta. It was all so warm and melted together like strings of notes in perfect harmony. Dessert was, again, fantastic - I got the hazelnut torte which came with a few component pieces (a stick of torte which was chocolatey and nutty and altogether quite nice, a meringue of sorts that I can't say I loved but still found very creative and inventive). It was great and I'd recommend it easily.Overall - I found this can be a bit of a hit or miss, but when it's a hit, it's really something memorable. Also - great view!",4.0,3.0,552,2017-11-12,43.646954,-79.382159,Canadian (New)
Canoe,"I had a lovely birthday dinner at Canoe. My boyfriend had mentioned it was my birthday when making the reservation and we had a fantastic table looking our over the lake. The servers and the manager all said happy birthday to me, which was also a nice touch. I really liked the ambiance of the restaurant - upscale but very comfortable, and fairly quiet so good for conversation. I felt more relaxed as soon as I sat down. The food ranged from good to amazing. The salad we had to start (green bean with pea shoots and watercress) was one of the best salads I've had in a restaurant. The combination of ingredients and flavours was very unique, and it was perfectly dressed. We also shared the smoked arctic char which I thought was just okay (not a ton of flavour, and a tiny portion). Our mains were excellent - I had pickerel and my boyfriend had pork. My dish had a large piece of fish and the sides were well-chosen, made for a good combination of flavours and textures. We also shared a side of broccoli rabe and japanese asparagus which was decent. For dessert we shared the butter tart which was delicious (and happy birthday was written on the plate in chocolate, another nice touch). Overall, we had a great meal and good service. I'm leaving off a star only because at the price point of the restaurant, I was hoping to be blown away by every dish which wasn't quite the case.

We made a reservation a month ahead of time to guarantee a window table.  As soon as you walk in, you are greeted by extremely friendly servers and hostesses. We looked online ahead of time to see the menu, so we ordered before the kitchens closed. The atmosphere was amazing and the view was stunning. The place itself is really nice and fancy. Everyone wore suits and dresses in the evening. The food came within 10-15 minutes, decently fast, but in my opinion all of their menu is extremely overpriced. My boyfriend ordered the Ontario beef rib eye, and I ordered the northern woods mushroom soup with a side of pan roasted carrots. The steak was tasty, as were the carrots, but the soup was just strange to me. It's texture is very gritty and not very soup like, I did not enjoy it because of that.

Canoe,"I've been to Canoe several times but this is my first review of this restaurant.  I've always came at lunch and I remember the food being excellent.  My bestie had her wedding at Canoe and I have to say it was the best wedding food I've ever had at any weddings I've been to.  If you're looking for a wedding venue book Canoe.  Also my bestie told me the cost was reasonable compared to other venues downtown.  My review this time around is for my birthday dinner.  Canoe is located downtown at the TD plaza on the 54th floor.  The views are amazing of the Toronto skyline.   When you walk in you can have your coat checked.  Our main server was a little cold and unfriendly. But the other staff from the front desk, greeter, coat check staff,  water refill staff to the food servers were all extremely friendly throughout the restaurant so it offset our main server's grumpiness so I'm still giving them a 5 star anyways.   When the food was brought out the food servers took their time explaining what each item was on the plate.  The presentation was top notch. We started off with the complimentary fresh bread with hummus dip. So good! For starters we got the mushroom soup which was a little bland but still good.  I guess it a good thing it's not too salty.  Then for our entrees we both got  the smoked duck dish.  I had mine done medium my bestie got hers medium raw which is how it's served.   I usually get medium well and it was perfect.  If it's too well done the meat becomes tough and dry.   For dessert I had the chocolate + Nancy mint dish. So so good and perfect portions because we were full but still wanted to try the desserts there.  Overall I was extremely happy with my meal. One of the best Birthday meals I've had for my Birthday month.  It's quite pricy, our bill came  to close to $200 for 2 people and we didn't even order alcohol! So if you drink it would be a lot more.  Coming here for a special occasion is a great treat!",4.0,5.0,552,2017-12-06,43.646954,-79.382159,Canadian (New)

Canoe,"Came for lunch during Winterlicious 2017.When it comes to Canoe, unless you're here for business or it's just another regular place by your standards, you'll probably be going tourist-mode, pressed up against the windows looking down on the world below you and into the horizon. Of course, with a camera.Or perhaps that is just something I do, given that the other diners were well-dressed and I'm pretty much out-of-place. But it is winterlicious, you're likely to attract uncultured commoners such as myself that typically prefer to grab a lunch special from chinatown.Everything is well-maintained. Kitchen looks really clean. Washrooms are top-notch, though they don't have any hand-dryers. Instead they opted for paper towels..We were seated at the west corner facing the CN tower, so there were a lot of viewing options, whether it's out into the lake on the south side, or west towards Mississauga. Because it was daytime, and snowstorm was forecasted throughout the day, we had the opportunity to observe how the distant cities looked when there's a huge snowstorm falling down on them. It was quite a sight, and something you wouldn't be able to see at night.Each dish comes with a wine pairing, if you would like to go that route.All of the dishes I ordered were great. From the foie gras, to the chuck flat, to the chocolate fondant. The beef was so tender that you could literally pick pieces apart with chopsticks.Service was good. Waiter walked over often to check up on things like water and feedback on dishes. Allowed me to challenge the dessert with chopsticks by limiting my choice of utensils. I don't know if this would be considered unacceptable, but for me it was all good.I don't know whether winterlicious reflects regular service, or how amazing the food really is for those with more experienced palates (given that I see a lot of less than stellar reviews on the food), but for me it's pretty much up there.",4.0,5.0,552,2017-01-31,43.646954,-79.382159,Canadian (New)
Dagu Rice Noodle,We love Dagu! The decor is simple and comfortable. The staff is friendly and speedy too! What we love most is the price and what you get.

Dagu Rice Noodle,"VENUE/AMBIANCE (5)Well-lit, modern restaurant with small tables and bar seating great for pairs and small groups. No dedicated parking - street parking and paid lots nearby. Clean and tidy when we arrived on a weeknight at 6:15 pm. SERVICE (4)Waiting for a table is somewhat a negative experience. It's been a cold winter and their lines often extend outside. However, the staff refuse to take group size or give out numbers to guests waiting in line outside of the restaurant. Only the few people who manage to squeeze into the small enclosure are given numbers. It's pretty inconvenient for larger groups. The waitress who served our table was great though - polite and friendly when she took our order and when she served our meal. FOOD (4)I ordered the Original Crossing the Bridge Rice Noodle (9.49). This includes 10 toppings, 3 slices of beef, unlimited noodles, and a boiling stone bowl of soup. Soup base was delicious - deep and flavorful but not salty. The bowl kept the soup hot,  through my first and even second bowl of noodle. There's enough toppings to accompany two bowls of noodles, but those with bigger appetites (or males) might want to order additional meat/protein. Noodles were chewy and well textured; they didn't get soggy while I ate. QUALITY/VALUE (4)For 9.49, this was reasonable for the location and amount of food served. Extra protein is 2.99, which makes the meal significantly more expensive. Other soup bases also cost a little more. For the original flavor, it's worth it.

The broth, while healthy, needed a lot of seasoning (felt like I was slurping noodles out of hot water lol). Yes, original crossing the bridge noodle is the one you wanna get if you like blogging or instagramming, but everything was underwhelming outside of presentation. Not to mention, I did not feel like I got my money's worth from such small topping portions. Don't think I would return on my own tbh.

Dagu Rice Noodle,"After discovering Yunan/Crossing Bridge Noodle Soup this year, I have been on a Chinese noodle exploration for the last 6 months.  I was thus highly anticipating the downtown opening of Dagu, a popular chain in China.  My boyfriend had visited the Markham branch and he had nothing but positive things to say about the food.  When we visited this downtown branch, my boyfriend concluded that it's almost as good as the branch up north.  The only real difference would be the quality of the sides, which are saltier and smaller in portion size at the downtown location compared to what you would find at the Markham one.  Fortunately, the flavour, content, and portion-size of the noodle soups are pretty much identical, so you're not losing much unless you really want to have sides on the periphery. We've been to Fudao, another popular vendor of Yunan/Crossing Bridge Noodle Soup.  Fudao pales in comparison to Dagu.  Fudao's noodles are so soft that they could feel soggy and their broths are bland, whereas Dagu's broths are rich in flavour and filled with chewy, firm noodles. The one trump card Fudao holds, however, is their price point.  Eating at Fudao will save you 2-3 dollars more, but remember it's at the cost of food quality.Pros:- Servers are fluent in English and Mandarin- Broths are rich in flavour- Wait times are minimal - Unlimited noodles - Noodles are firm and plentiful- Booths are spacious and you can easily fit 6 people in them- Clean- Noodle soups stay hot for an extremely long time - Walking distance from Eaton CentreCons:- Very little protein in the broths- Sides are saltier and small in portion size- Drinks are well over-priced- Stone bowls are 150 degrees celcius in temperature, so be mindful for children and company that is animated/clumsy- More expensive than other Crossing Bridge/Yunan Noodle Soup vendors",3.0,4.0,57,2017-12-08,43.655398,-79.38429,"Chinese , Noodles"
Dagu Rice Noodle,"We have been meaning to try out this new place for a while but each time we drove by there was a lineup outside so we would go to our usual favourite in the area, Sansotei. Today we got there early. Roughly 4:45. Still had to wait about ten minutes but inside. The guy at the door was very nice and gave us a menu to look at while we waited. The place is nice and bright and has a funky vibe. I did feel like I was in Melbourne's Asian restaurant heaven for a bit. The music is loud but not intrusive. And the whole place is buzzing with wait staff delivering hot bowls of goodness. We sat down and Cindy explained how the menu works. The top four soups are already filled with all of the ingredients and made when they come to you. The rest below you put in the ingredients yourself. We opted for the ready made ones and I had the pork bone while my wife had the fish one that they recommend.  Both were really good. Although a huge warning. And they warn you as well. THE BOWL IS CRAZY HOT!!!!!!!!!!Both of us had at least one touch of scalding on our hands so please be careful. We also had a tofu appetizer which was great. The noodles were good. Not my favourite but good. And the soups were very rich and not overly salty. And each had a quail egg, some ham like squares, cabbage, woodear mushrooms and corn pieces. I think I preferred my wife's choice. It actually reminded me of soups my aunt makes in Poland. A little sour but so rich and delicious and with a little heat.  So great on a cold day!  We really liked our food and will likely come back.

Dagu Rice Noodle,"3.5 StarsVisited ~7pm on Saturday right after Black Friday and stood in line for what seems like 30mins. It's definitely not worth the wait but overall was satisfied with our noodle soup and sides. The server was helpful w/ the menu, ""crossing bridge"" means the noodle and ingredients are separate from the soup and you add it all in yourself vs. the regular which has it all prepared inside. The waitress recommended tomato or the spicy sour crossing bridge noodle soup but she's from Szechuan so her taste profile may skew on the heavier spicier side. She also recommends adding shrimp which I say is not worth the effort since the shrimp isn't peeled! I actually enjoyed the simple broth from the braised pork bone instead since the delicate taste of braising the bones are more apparent, unlike the tomato version where the tomato overwhelms it. Ordered - w/ ** marked for recommendations - Signature Braised Bone in Pork Rice Noodle Soup  **Recommend over tomato version though very skimpy on the protein so you might want to add meat. The soup broth here really sets itself apart from other places. There's a reason why it's called signature! - Tomato Flavoured Crossing Bridge Noodle Soup with Beef Slices + added shrimp - Tomato kind of cover the taste of the braised broth and only ~3 pieces of shrimp are provided and needs to peeled - Deep fried Pumpkin w/ red bean paste - **Recommend chewy and absolutely delicious- Egg Tofu - Interesting texture reminds me of a mix of a mushroom and tofu with a vinegary sesame sauce- Deep fried Durian pastry - It's okay it doesn't seem like they added sugar as it's less sweet than I expected for dessert - Salty crispy chicken - Good no complaints here",3.0,3.0,57,2017-12-01,43.655398,-79.38429,"Chinese , Noodles"
Dagu Rice Noodle,"I'm a converted fan. The first time I tried their noodles, it was good but there wasn't a huge wow factor. I really didn't think I would come back but now, I find myself craving the warmth and comfort of their refreshing broth and noodles. It just really hits the spot for me without making me feel lethargic after a hot meal.I always get the signature pork bone soup - it's rich enough in flavour for me without being overly salty. The bowl comes out steaming hot but it doesn't retain heat so it's best to put the noodles in ASAP to cook it for a bit longer.I don't eat too much meat in my diet normally so the amount on the bone and other ingredients (ham, quail egg, bamboo shoots, red sausage, etc.) in the bowl was perfect for me. Though I can see how some people would not be satisfied with the amount of protein they provide. But honestly, how is that any different from other noodle places that give you two slices of beef for the same price? There's a reason why you can choose add-ons. Their sides are also amazing - I'd recommend the crispy chicken (a.k.a. popcorn chicken) and sliced beef and ox tongue in Szechuan chili sauce!If you're hesitant about the 3 star rating, keep in mind that for all Chinese restaurants on Yelp - that would be equivalent to 4 stars for the food if you ignore all the people bitching about the service. I haven't had a bad experience myself in the 4 times I've come here - quick to seat us, quick to take orders, quick to come out with food, and didn't take forever getting us the bill and change. They're a busy restaurant so yeah, it would take some effort to flag them down but I haven't seen any of the servers being rude to people. So if you're not sensitive to service at asian restaurants, definitely give this place a try!",3.0,4.0,57,2018-01-09,43.655398,-79.38429,"Chinese , Noodles"
Dagu Rice Noodle,"Despite hearing many people talk about the long lines, I didn't actually have to wait in line. I came maybe 30mins after they opened and not many people were there yet. That being said, it seemed I got in right before the lunch time rush (thank goodness). Poor server was running around to evey table , so I didn't blame her for not being overly friendly. I felt that she was quite efficient albeit a little aggressive when putting the dishes down on the table. That didn't really bother me at all though.Their menu consists of rice noodle soups. Being a noodle lover, that was the perfect thing for me. I got the spicy and sour crossing the bridge noodle soup. Tbh I was hesitant at first--it's always a hit or miss when it comes to sour soups but it tasted great! More on the sour side but not over the top.I think it would've been better if it was a littler spicier but I was overall satisfied with the taste. The dish comes with several toppings, and unless you want extra meat or something, it's fine as it is. You put the toppings in yourself, they come separate from the soup since they don't want to overcook it. The noodles were just the right texture for me (soft but very slightly chewy). AND YOU GET UNLIMITED NOODLE REFILLS. If you're like me, who doesn't drink much soup, adding extra noods in is a great bonus. Price-wise I do think it's fair. They give you a variety of toppings that stores normally don't give and the soup stays hot the whole time. Also very worth the money if you get additional noodle refills. Yummy and filling!Overall, I recommend this to noodle lovers or just on a cold winter day!",3.0,4.0,57,2017-11-27,43.655398,-79.38429,"Chinese , Noodles"
Dagu Rice Noodle,"I can see why this place has only ""okay"" reviews. I ordered the rice noodle soup with braised bone beef + shrimp for $2.99 more. My bill ended up being just shy of $20. The broth was decently good and basic, beef was deliciously tender, and there were only 3 unpeeled shrimp. Personally, this meal is worth $10 max. I know it's unlimited noodles but I felt satisfied with just one. My friend ordered the soup with mushroom. The menu called it crossing the bridge. It seems like the additional ingredients (tofu, bamboo etc) is on the side and you have to put it in the soup yourself (Whereas my soup already had it). There's a line outside during peak hours.

Dagu Rice Noodle,"Not sure why this place has 3 stars but I think it deserves 4. We dropped by on Saturday around 1pm and waited for approx. 20 minutes. They give you a number and you have to wait on location to be called. I've had friends wait over an hour so don't come here if you're in a rush. SERVICE:The service was pretty quick (maybe they have hired more staff recently) when we asked for extra noodles (unlimited by the way) and took away our empty plates promptly. FOOD: We got both a spicy and a tomato crossing the bridge rice noodle soup. They were both very flavourful and we didn't find them dull as other reviewers suggested. So far, I like this place over some of the other restaurants that offer a similar noodle + toppings concept. We also tried a strawberry yakult drink at $4.50 - while it was refreshing, half of it was basically foam so I wouldn't order it again.AMBIANCE:The restaurant is clean and nicely designed.

Dagu Rice Noodle,"Dropped by this place for a hot bowl of noodle soup. Reading the reviews we were looking forward to our meal. We both had the pork bone noodle soup with the addition of beef. It came out in a large cast iron pot and was extremely HOT. For an Asian restaurant I found the broth tasty without being overly salty.  In the broth were two large pork bones, each with a good amount of meat, as well as small quail egg. Noodles had the right amount of texture and came in a separate bowl. There is free refills on noodles which was good as one bowl wasn't quite enough. Service helpful, establishment clean. All in all a comforting meal at a reasonable price.",3.0,4.0,57,2017-12-30,43.655398,-79.38429,"Chinese , Noodles"
Dagu Rice Noodle,"When we got here, there was a short line outside the restaurant. Small rant: The system to seat people is quite inefficient. They only jot down your name and party size for groups that are in the indoor waiting area (fits about 6ppl). Anyone after that, they are not interested in your group size and you are to wait outside until there is few enough people before you so you fit that tiny space. So essentially if there is a party of 6 before you and lots of unconnected 2 people tables, you ain't getting seated as a party of 2. Nonetheless, we went early at 6, so the wait was only 15mins.Having been to similar noodle chains uptown, I was happy to see more soup base options at Dagu. They are priced ~$2 more than I'm used to, but could be just a dt price. Similar Yunan style noodle setup: You pick soup, comes with 10 raw misc. toppings you cook in the boiling soup. Noodle itself is bottomless.Food came within 5mins of ordering. I had the mushroom soup and I was very impressed. Mushrooms were fragrant, there was good quantity and variety (enoki, button mushrooms, ouster mushrooms etc). Toppings were basic hot pot offerings but the soup really elevated the whole experience. I also like how the soup did not taste sour from pickled veggies, which is something I often dislike in Yunan style noodles.Overall, service was prompt, beautiful noodle dish, I would love to come back for more.",3.0,4.0,57,2018-01-12,43.655398,-79.38429,"Chinese , Noodles"

Dagu Rice Noodle,"Short summary: Extra dishes wasted on toppings they can just add in to the bowl before serving. My friend and I were debating between this place and Lan Zhou Ramen but since this place was new and the line wasn't bad, we came here on a Monday late evening around 8:30. Friend tried to come here before but the line was way too long so we both had pretty high expectations to see what the hype was about. Food:Friend ordered the signature rice noodle soup with braised bone-in pork while I got the original crossing the bridge rice noodle with beef slices.The soup taste was slightly different between these two, but my friend's came with all the side toppings on a lot of little dishes before the food, while mine had all the same toppings but it was just put in the soup before it came out to our table....we're still not sure what the point of this is. Maybe all the extra dishes are supposed to wow people presentation wise? Not worth it. You can get refills on the noodles but not on these toppings.

English food names are not self explanatory as well so I would recommend looking up choices on Instagram for visuals. We came here on a Tues night with no lineup but it was packed. Suggest going early (630pm for dinner) to avoid the crowds. Would have given this place 5 stars but the server forgot to bring out the bowl of noodles after we received our soup base + condiments. After waiting a few mins we had to ask for the noodles. Other than that, the service was attentive afterwards.

I mean I didn't even get a  tray with all kinds of sides, they put all sides into the soup already. And the soup was not that sizzling hot. Both the soup and the chicken drum tasted salty but not tasty. Huge chunks of pork in soup. I wasn't expecting that. I am pretty sure I prefer to eat at deer garden or fudao. 20 bucks is expensive for the awful food quality and service.

Dagu Rice Noodle,"I find it strange - that the early Yelp reviews were so negative about Dagu and yet during dinnertime the line up to get in is over 25 person deep.   Trusting my eyes, I gave it a try. Food:Specializing in rice noodles, there is a choice of different soups along with additional items (like beef slices, lamb, shrimp, etc). I ordered the Tomato flavoured crossing the bridge noodles with extra slices of beef. All your ingredients are provided separately.  You then place it in a bowl of boiling tomato flavoured soup. The beauty of this place is that you control how cooked and the intensity of your soup flavouring. Tip: Don't just throw everything in at the same time. That is a rookie mistake!  Raw meat first (or later if you like it more Red), then cold meats, then sauce, then noodles, then preserved veggies. Lastly you put in any fresh veggies. This provides the proper texture - your soup noodle will turn out excellent!  Mine was tangy and the noodles were al dente. Decor: Fairly clean and comfortable. Place is still brand new. Service:  I was not expecting Ritz Carlton. Still I was pleasantly surprised that my servers were polite.  I asked for a water when I ordered and got it right away. Overall: the line up is justified. This is a good place for some unique tasting noodle soup in downtown Toronto. Another solid 4+. Tip#2: get there before 5pm. The line grows exponentially thereafter.",3.0,4.0,57,2017-10-24,43.655398,-79.38429,"Chinese , Noodles"

We were greeted at the door with smiles, the host took our jackets and we sat at our table. The whole restaurant is very very small, it maybe seats 20 people. We had the Crème Brûlée which was amazing, exactly the way it should be. Creamy Creme at the bottom and the top had a perfect crust. Next up... WARNING... The Apple Tarte with Calvados Sabayon. FUCKING PERFECT. This came much later as it takes about 25 minutes to cook. The pastry itself is perfect, buttery and crisp. The thin apples are then topped with the Sabayon which is a custardy sauce that has a bit of liquor. The Combination of flavours is overwhelming.

Chabrol Restaurant,"My boyfriend took me here for dinner during the weekend. He mentioned that he booked a table one month prior so I'd highly recommend booking well in advance! Chabrol is a boutique-sized restaurant. It seats 5 tables of 2 and a bar of approximately 10 people. We were lucky to be seated away from the group of 2's or else everyone would basically eavesdrop each others' conversations haha. Overall, I think Chabrol is a great impress-your-date place. Unfortunately, the quality of the food wasn't as good as I expected.DRINKS:* Domaine Merlin Chardonnay 2014 - Macon La Roche Vineuse (mine)* Pinot Noir (his)* RIESLING-POACHED FOIE GRAS with black currant and salsify (2/5)Ok.. I LOVE foie gras. I had very high hopes for this fancy sounding riesling-poached foie gras! Unfortunately, it was rather.. stinky(?) I really didn't like this. 2 points are given for the nicely displayed pieces of bread and salsify haha. Great for Instagram.* TARTINE OF RABBIT with braised endive (3.5/5)We felt a little guilty for ordering rabbit meat but the meat was delicious...!! It's a simple appetizer to cleanse your palettes before the mains. Even though this dish had a lot of bread, it wasn't overwhelming. I'd recommend sharing this dish between two people.* ""TTORO"" (4/5)This was delicious - I'd recommend this soup. It tastes like a squash soup with fresh seafood. Seafood included fish, mussels and shrimps. The fish was delicious! The soup was not overly thick so it didn't make us feel bloated afterwards. * MUSCOVY DUCK with barigoule of artichokes, chestnuts, fennel and pearl onions (2/5)It's a boiled duck with watered-down flavour. What stood out to me the most were the chestnuts in the dish. Otherwise, the whole dish was quite bland in taste. The duck meat was way too soggy. I wouldn't recommend ordering this.DESSERTS:* APPLE TARTE with calvados sabayon (4/5)Our server highly recommended the apple tarte for desserts. Good recommendation! The apples were still crispy, which paired nicely with the soft pastry for the tarte. The sauce they poured on top was creamy and light.

Chabrol Restaurant,"A wonderful 4.5 star experience ... service is very good and elevated this from a 4 to a 4.5Chabrol is a small dining gem in Toronto.  It's menu, like its space, is small but extremely well thought out & curated and very well executed. Service here has the perfect balance of being friendly and refined.  Chabrol is not an easy reservation to get ... it is popular but also there's only 5 tables of 2 and a few seats at the bar.  It is a tiny spot in Yorkville where you'll be amazed at the chef's ""kitchen"".  It is the size of a closet and yet some of the most wonderful big flavours come from it. We arrived and walked through their patio courtyard area which houses some 4 person tables.  It had been raining hard that day and though it was covered, watch for the little puddles!  We were warmly greeted by what seemed to be the sous chef who is outside the restaurant in a temporary bar area.  Quickly we were shown to our seat and possibly the most cheerful wait staff attended to our table. I can understand previous comments about how it is possibly too intimate.  You are within inches of your neighbouring table and your table is very small.  It can barely hold two dinner plates, a side dish, and an entree plate.  Much negotiating with the dinner ware was needed.We decided to split all the items to enjoy the various flavours and in some ways, I shouldn't have!  I really did want to keep the Ttoro to myself!  We did order the Ttoro (Basque seafood stew), Braised Lamb, Escarole Gratin, and finished with wonderful Apple tarte.Ttoro - This Basque stew was quite amazing on flavour.  It is a stew based on fish, tomato, shellfish, and normally a paprika of some sort.  Perhaps my mind was slipping but I thought I heard the staff describe saffron being added and no mention of paprika.  The fish and shellfish is added last minute to poach just before serving.  The broth is delicious... they give you in house made crust bread (pain de campagne?) to scoop every last drip of the wonderful soup and trust me, you'd want to lick the plate.  It is a vibrant bold spiced flavour.  It wasnt overwhelming on the shellfish but I was surprised how the white fish, mussel, and shrimp took little of the broth flavour.  I wouldn't call them tasteless but they just didnt any noted flavour.  The mussels were quite small... about a half the size of the ones we had at Kiin.  The shrimp was a touch bordering towards rubbery.  The fish was a touch too dry/firm instead of moist and delicate.  The broth is a 5+/5 but the seafood was ok.  So overall 4/5Braised Lamb - Another solid dish ... the lamb didn't need any knife to cut through it.  It was incredibly tender.  An interesting thing about the lamb, it wasn't remotely gamey or had the typical strong 'lamb' flavour.  It was well complimented by the fennel and asparagus.  The fennel had that licorice note but instead of making everything taste like black licorice ... it added a nice earthy herbal note.  The overall flavour was muted and comforting... this is a dish I would welcome on a cold day.  Well done but comparing to the Ttoro, it just haven't the same 'wow' flavour profile. 4/5Escarole gratin - This eclipsed the braised lamb completely when they were served together.  Thinly sliced celeriac is treated like a potato and layered with escarole, savoury, cheese, and bread crumbs to top.  This was soo good.  Crunchy flavourful breadcrumbs covered the creamy cheese and tender pieces of celeriac to create a better and more flavourful version of potato dauphinoise.  It is quite a generous plating of this side dish.  5/5Apple Tarte - It is rare for me to say the must order dish is dessert but in this case, this apple tarte deserves that recognition.  Buttery flakey pastry that puffs around a tower of thinly slice and tender apples  then enveloped and drowned in an amazing sabayon that is perfectly sweet and notes of cider popping out.  This is one of the better desserts I've had all year and I've possibly had too much.  You can see the chef use a double bain marie and put some serious work in whipping the yolks, cider, and sugar to get that incredible creamy texture that can easily fool you to thinking its cream.  5/5Overall, this is a wonderful fine dining experience with the service possibly overshadowing some of the food. It's not often you find a good balance between refined & thoughtful service and kicking out the pretentious attitude of some finer dining places.  The Apple Tarte is truly amazing though!",4.0,4.0,53,2017-07-04,43.671049,-79.391714,French

We ended up packing them to go because the portion was quite large. I'm giving Chabrol a really high rating because their service is so friendly and wonderful! Their staff is chatty, always smiling, and attentive to your needs. I dropped by on my birthday and they gave me dessert with a little candle on top. Usually after your meal the restaurant will serve you a mint or a candy, and at Chabrol they gave handmade lemon... cookies? I'm not sure how to describe them.

The wine is good but seems to be priced a bit high for what you get. Lots of French options. The beer is good, too, and they have Belgian Trappist beers available. The food seems hit or miss. I liked the Papillote of Whitefish. The presentation was awesome--they open the bag and pour butter on it at the table. Solid dish. Unfortunately I can't say the same for the Braised Lamb with Fennel. The lamb wasn't what I expected for braised lamb--it seemed almost boiled. The flavours were somewhat bland and very mediocre compared to other lamb dishes I've had in Toronto and around the world. I definitely wouldn't come back for that. Overall, a pretty good spot. If I had ordered the fish instead of the lamb for myself I probably would've given it 5, but the lamb dish was disappointing. The decor is gorgeous, the service is friendly.

The beauty of Chabrol is that the ingredients are such high quality and everything is cooked to bring out the natural flavors.

The restaurant is small, but it has an incredible patio for the summer. This place is pricey - but more than worth it, for special occasions this has to be one of my favorite places, the food, service and ambiance are all incredible.While my many experiences have been incredible, my one complaint would be for booking parties, I looked into renting the venue for a special occasion, which they were very helpful about. However to rent the venue there is a down payment of 5000$ - which does not include any of the food or the wine which we obviously would be getting. Although the establishment is in York ville, which is always going to be very expensive, a payment of 5000$ before food and drinks is a bit ridiculous. For a party it would roughly be around 15 000$.

Apple tart is very good and fun to eat. Very tiny restaurant, which makes for a unique and intimate experience - neat to be so close to food preparation behind the counter, and to be in one single room with other patrons - but can also be distracting, as you're sitting very close to other tables.

For desert we shared the creme brûlée and apple tart. All dishes were exceptionally good. If I had to choose one desert to try I would do the apple tart.

FAT Lamb Kouzina,"Extraordinary.  I'm from Montreal and pretty much can't eat Greek food in Toronto overall.  I've had some that is half decent compared to Mtl Greek but haven't had a ""good"" meal out here.  Well last night I had a GREAT Greek meal out here!From great people who obviously love what they do.  Simple, fresh, homemade (tziziki and pita) and their lamb was noooooo f'n joke at ALL.  Some of the best lamb I've ever eaten anywhere and easily some of the best Greek food, and I'm tempted to say the best, that I've had in my life.  Top notch. I feel bad giving the review because I don't want them to change what they do at all and expansion sometimes does that.  But food this good deserves to be shared so I can't be a selfish a-hole about it.  Thus, the 5 star review.If you care about the care put into your food, then put this food into your mouth.If quality is important to you, then show yours - go to Fat Lamb Kouzina.If you're a foodie, (you can even ask Judy) eating here is your duty.Now.... do you see?Great staff, food, and atmosphere.  Small, cozy, and super real.  Super, natural, maybe supernatural.I got so sidetracked by the food I forgot to mention how engaging the staff are.  Really good guys who really love what they do.  This is a passion for them and it shows.",4.0,5.0,50,2018-01-12,43.672551,-79.387868,"Greek , Cooking Classes , Caterers"

We planned to eat in and I didn't think I would finish my gyro so I got it to go. Wow was I wrong.. I finished the whole thing. Everything was delicious and very fresh tasting.

FAT Lamb Kouzina,"When you go to a place named Fat Lamb Kouzina, it's only appropriate to order lamb, right? I love lamb and I love gyros but I didn't see it on the menu. No problem, my server said I could get that but they only serve gyros on a pita. Hmmm, I didn't want a sandwich. No problem, I could get lamb gyros with potatoes, and a salad. Yay!I paid for my food and sat at one of three window seats looking out onto Yonge Street. They only have one table, a rather large one, with shared seating. The smell of the food was making me hungrier.A young lady brought my order to me. Hmmm, two (takeout) boxes? Okay, everything is served in takeout boxes but I'm still a bit puzzled. One box had lamb with potatoes and tzatziki and the other box had lamb with salad and tzatziki. Did I order two dishes? Is that why it cost $19?The salad was very good, well dressed and tasty. I was, however, a bit disappointed with the lamb and tzatziki. I found them both to be lacking flavour. The lamb needed more seasoning and the tzatziki needed more garlic.Darn, I really wanted to like this place with its cool name.",4.0,3.0,50,2017-08-04,43.672551,-79.387868,"Greek , Cooking Classes , Caterers"
FAT Lamb Kouzina,"I had been passing this little restaurant for a month before I decided to check it out. After the gym one afternoon I decided to order take out and eat it at home. My order included a pork wrap, and a slice of cheese pie. As I always do, I asked for no onions for the wrap, and had to wait for the pie because they were sold out. They were sold out of a lot of things at 2:30pm on a Saturday. Once ready, my food was packaged in a brown paper bag which turned out to be a bad idea. Once I got home - 20 minutes away, the juice in the wrap had leaked through the bag on to my pants, the wrap was soggy, there were onions in my wrap and the $7 cheese pie was pretty small and not filling. In sum, I had to throw out the wrap because I can't eat onions, the pie was overpriced for what you got, and the packaging resulted in a soggy mess. My advice: stay in rather than get it to go, and check your order carefully (if asked to omit an ingredient) before taking a bite or taking it to go. Cost:Slice of cheese pie $7Wrap $12P.S.

FAT Lamb Kouzina,"I'M STILL SALIVATING JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW FANTASTIC THIS MEAL WAS.Having opened just about 8 weeks ago, this cute little home-run restaurant is located conveniently along Yonge street within the Yorkville neighbourhood.I came with a few friends and inquired about which menu item was the best seller. I was informed it was the Pork Gyro so I ordered one and MY OH MY, DID IT NOT DISAPPOINT. When it arrived, it was picture perfect and accordingly so, it tasted absolutely delicious. In fact, this was by far THE most delicious gyro I've ever had - succulent, flavourful pulled pork atop an amazingly crisp yet fluffy pita, paired with fresh tomatoes, onions, dill, and sour cream. YUM! The total was $12, which is more expensive than what regular restaurants would charge but it was 100% well-spent. They were fairly generous with the pork and it was overall a filling portion.

FAT Lamb Kouzina,"This fine establishment is proof that yelp works, well for me anyways. If it had not been for my fellow yelp community, shout out to dilys ,I'm embarrassed to say I never would have tried this place, or probably even hear about it. How fortunate I was to be a yelper after eating here. My first impression of the restaurant was a little negative,if I'm being honest. I'm so used to getting rice served with everything that at first when I was told the lamb and potatoes isn't served on a bed of rice, I was pretty disappointed. That disappointed dissipated with the first bite of that tender lamb. It was literally cooked to perfection. I have never tasted meat, lamb meat none the less, that was so moist and full of flavour, that didn't cost 100$. Lamb has a tendency of being dry and has that gamey taste; NOT HERE. I'm still in shock at how amazing this meal was. Potatoes are pleasantly flavoured and paired with a hearty amount of homemade tzatziki sauce. For only 2$ more I got a house made pita bread, which yes you guessed it, was also incredible. I'm seriously looking forward to coming back here again, maybe try the moussaka.

FAT Lamb Kouzina,"First off, the flavours... Divine!  The food was tasty, well-seasoned, and just plain delicious.  They've truly put in a lot of effort into perfecting their dishes.  Service was lovely. Welcoming and grateful.  You could tell the customers are top priority.  So why not five stars?  The portion sizes seemed kind of small for the price you pay.  I had a lamb special served in a small-ish box for $15.  There was tender and flavourful lamb, a few potato wedges, and a dollop of tzatziki.  If the prices were brought down by about 10-15%, it would seem more reasonable for the amount of food currently being served. Otherwise, add more potatoes.  Put in a little salad.  Give a bit more to bulk up the serving.  Perhaps if the food was served in a different container, the presentation of quantity might be perceived differently as well.  I'm just offering some constructive feedback, that's all.  I would like to emphasize the owners seem like lovely people who are cooking with heart and soul.

FAT Lamb Kouzina,"Tip:  If possible, try to come earlier on in the day as they run out of items.I came an hour before closing and there were only gyros (lamb or beef) and salad left.  And there was a line-up!  Pitas, as per review and website, were definitely homemade, so that definitely sets Fat Lamb apart from other pita competitors.I must mention that this place is not a cheapie place.  They had run out of pork gyro, so offered lamb ($15) at the entree price, but replaced the orzo with pita.  Lamb was very tender and filling.  Pork/beef gyros are $12.  Granted, lamb is a more expensive meat and there was a good amount of it.  So just brace yourself if you think it's going to be quick-pita pit type pricing.Village Salad was $12, looked gorgeous with all the colours, rip tomatoes were bright red, but it came in smallish-square takeout box.There is a bit of a wait for the food which is home cooking, but expect sitdown prices.  There is bar seating at the window (3 seats) + at the order counter (3 seats) + a large table in the centre, which half of it is unusable because patrons would be lining up on the other side.",4.0,4.0,50,2017-05-28,43.672551,-79.387868,"Greek , Cooking Classes , Caterers"

FAT Lamb Kouzina,Fat Lamb Kouzina is an awesome neighborhood spot in Yorkville to grab a quick bite!They are only open for lunch at the moment and close down around 5pm. I got pulled pork wrapped in pita bread and it was so good!The portion was pretty big and there's a generous amount of pork wrapped up in the fluffy homemade pita bread. It's definitely comfort food with oil dripping through the wrap. But that's what made it so delicious! The owner was telling us about how they travelled through Greece to cook with the grandmas.

FAT Lamb Kouzina,I finally got to try Fat Lamb Kouzina this week for lunch.  It's located just south of Davenport on Yonge. It's a quick 2 minute walk from Yonge and Bloor Subway Station. It's a great small space that puts out amazing food. There is some window seats to people watch while you have lunch and there is also a communal table in the middle of the restaurant. I have read a lot of amazing things about this restaurant. They are all TRUE!  They blew me away with the quality of their food. I love Lamb so I went with the Herb Roasted Lamb with Roast Potato and Tzatziki. I decided to grab a homemade pita bread to go with my lunch. I always need some pita when I have Tzatziki! My mouth is watering thinking about this lunch. The lamb was cooked to perfection! It was very tender melt in your mouth. It was moist and juicy. Perfection! The roast potatoes are perfectly done.  The Tzatziki on top is a generous portion.  This food is cooked like you would at home. It's was if my mom had made this dish. They really strive on making the food just as they would at home. You can really tell that they take the time to make sure everything is top notch and cooked to perfection. I cannot say enough good things about Fat Lamb Kouzina. I will definitely be back.

La Bella Managua,"A solid 4*s.  Knocked off a star for food taking approx. 30mins to arrive to table after ordering.Arrived just before 3pm, ordered within 5-10mins, drinks came 15mins after that (yes, including water), and food came within the 30min mark of ordering.  I think this is a tad too long to wait.  Water should've arrived shortly after ordering, not 15mins after that.Other than food taking its time to arrive to the table, servers did check-in with our table at least 3Xs.  So that is a good sign!We ordered their version of Mojito ($8.50), ""Tacos"", & Pollo a la Parillia.  Mojito was pretty good, although it wasn't as alcohol-y, but with more fizz - Club Soda, I think.  Still, I think this would be refreshing especially when the weather gets warmer!""Tacos"" ($10) - Think taquitos, without cheese, then a coleslaw with some sour cream and ketchup zigzagged all over the dish.  They could've done without the ketchup as the coleslaw was already sour.  This dish was good, but again, not what I expected when I read ""tacos"".Pollo a la Parillia (~$16) - basically 2 flat pieces of grilled chicken over rice and peas, some pieces of plantains, with a tomato/avo/sweet pepper salad.  Portions of the rice + salad were generous.  The chicken pieces were thin and on the smaller side.  Dish was good for 1.5 person.  ***Entrées, imo, were totally shareable esp. IF you also order an app.  On its own, you still maybe a bit hungry afterwards.***Most of the patrons appeared to be Spanish speaking, so that gives me an indication that the spot is pretty authentic.  Not a cheapie spot though, expect to spend ~$15-20pp, without any alcoholic drinks.I'd go back, but NOT on an empty stomach!!!",4.0,4.0,163,2018-01-28,43.662231,-79.42499,"Latin American , Nicaraguan"

The service was a little slow, but it may have been due to it being a busy night. We ordered the drinks, ceviche, and for the mains had the rack of lamb, camarones (tiger shrimp) and a vegetarian platter. The food came out in good time. To start of, the drinks were very delicious, but the ceviche was not the best I have had. There wasn't much fish in it. I had the lamb and it was cooked perfectly and the gravy was great. My friends had the tiger shrimp and the bandeja tipica (with fried cheese) and they seemed to like their meals as well.

La Bella Managua,"Attitude does not make for a successful business. I have previously dined here before and even brought friends to celebrate my birthday there. However, on this particular day I decided to bring in another person to show them what the culture was all about. We walked in. No one greeted us and we decided to sit down. There was a group of young kids there ( guessing college students). I realized after awhile that the girl at that table full of students was the daughter of one of the waitresses. And so she had brought her friends to chill there during a weekday early afternoon. What bothered me about this wasn't that they were young kids but that they made it a point to listen into my conversation in another language and talk about it to each other. The second they noticed that I was aware they turned completely red and were embarrassed. So if you are going to allow your daughter to chill at your work establishment with her friends, make sure they respect the actual paying patrons that are sharing that space and not snickering about others in a rude manner. Back to the waitress. She took our order and since we were the only ones there I figured it wouldn't take long. Well I was wrong it did take long and we had to keep looking up to see if they forgot about us.  Well the food finally arrived. I ordered the carne asada and the other plate ordered was the catch of the day red snapper. Well as we ate it I noticed that my meat was on the hard side. And the red snapper was very dry even for a fried fish. When the waitress came over to see how our food was we told her the red snapper was too dry.Well it seemed like the waitress was offended by it and said "" what do you mean it's dry ? It's fried fish, that's how it is"". Believe me we order fried fish in several restaurants and it's not dry inside. So the waitress disagreed and left us. She could have at least acknowledged our comment and taken it as a constructive criticism. But instead she left rudely. I think she was so offended that she told another waitress to finish with us while she sat at a table near the back and sulked. The waitress took forever to get us our bill and instead of asking if she will be needing to bring the debit machine she left us for another 5-7 min waiting. So we looked around and raised our hand to the ex waitress of ours who was still just sitting there and she rudely says loudly "" yah! She's coming!""  at which the other waitress realized she was supposed to come to us. When the ex waitress did this there was another man who also worked there sitting at another table and I clearly heard him say in another language ""do they understand ?"" Because he clearly wanted to say something in Spanish but she told him we did understand so he remained silent. Our replacement waitress did not smile, barely spoke and was worse than a robot. This rude attitude was uncalled for and has tarnished all my other experiences of this place. But when I think about it, the service was never stellar to begin with, I just like places that remind me of Latin America. We were not being rude about the fish being dry. If you ask us how our meal is and we are paying, we will be honest. I didn't even get to say how dry my meat was.   Imagine how she would of been if I had told her that ? .... Needless to say do not come here expecting super friendly smiles and interactions. Just come here if you want to experience some sort of Latin American food with sour faces. It's unfortunate that I had to write this review but I only give one star to places that lack in personal customer service skills. Even if they had been super friendly but the food was terrible would they have received at least a three star.

My food came with a sweet sauce and my friends came with a spicy onion sauce. I've never had Nicaraguan food before so this was a great introduction.

La Bella Managua,"Although the entrees run a little pricey, you get a lot for your money. I ordered the carne asada which was $14.50 and could have easily fed two people (or half could have been packed up for lunch the next day). As it was, it was too delicious so I ate it all! The steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned to a drool-worthy level. The meal also came with a coleslaw type salad, rice, slices of avocado, beans, and a choice of sweetened or green plantain. I also ordered the national drink of Nicaragua which I thought was a nice item to have on the menu for people curious about the culture and its cuisine. It was very sour at first, but once I got used to it, I liked it. The service was courteous, though a little slow and they don't check up on you often. Sometimes this is nice though! They were not snooty when members of the group couldn't pronounce some of the names of the dishes. The restaurant is on the small side, but there were plenty of empty tables when I arrived at around 6 pm on a weeknight. The spot grew busier as we were there, so I got the impression that it's a well-known and well-liked spot. By the time we left, multiple groups were waiting for tables. The music was pleasant, appropriate to the setting, and not too loud. The ambiance is casual/cozy/homey, and a good spot for dinner on a winter night, but try not to sit too close to the door as when it opens you get a cold blast. Would definitely recommend this restaurant. It was a great introduction to Nicaraguan cuisine!",4.0,4.0,163,2017-12-19,43.662231,-79.42499,"Latin American , Nicaraguan"

I found the whole thing to be fresh, tasty and it gave me a great experience of authentic Nicaraguan cuisine.

La Bella Managua,"Where do I begin... The moment my friends and I sat down we were asked, ""so boys and girls, did you guys just finish your last day of school?"" We genuinely thought she was joking until she went on about it. It was definitely not a professional way to treat your clientele, even if we age well for our age.  When we ordered, I clearly ordered the roasted chicken but when the orders came she claimed that I ordered the other chicken dish. I wouldn't be as upset if she kept insisting I ordered the chicken dish and kept redirecting the blame to my colleague beside me when I pointed to what I wanted and read the dish name TWO TIMES IN BOTH LANGUAGES ON THE MENU. The staff offered a very low level of integrity throughout the service. After we all paid (with the 15% tip they slap on top), they were badgering us and harassing us about whether we paid or not. The chicken dish that I accepted in the end was okay. However my friends who ordered the boneless steak dish found their meat to tough, dry and rather bland. The ceviche was okay but definitely not noteworthy for the price you pay for it. If this is how they want to treat young professionals, I say go for it and we will take our buisness elsewhere while you wait on your baby boomers to die off. Considering the substandard quality of food and God awful service, I definitely would not recommend this restaurant to ANYONE despite the good reviews.

When I come back (which I definitely will) I would love to try their Carne Asada, and their tacos as it looked mouth watering when I saw other people ordering it.  The only downfall was our first server, as she was very dry, didn't seem friendly and gave the impression she did not want to be there.  We asked her for suggestions as to what we should get as it was our first time and she just gave us a dry and quick response.  She basically just wanted to get our order and gtfo lol.  Halfway through our dinner we did get another server who was super friendly and accomodating, thank goodness!I will still give this place a 5 star as the food overtook that one server's bitterness and everyone else working there was super friendly!Thank you La Bella Managua for feeding me my first Nicaraguan food and making me love it!",4.0,5.0,163,2017-05-24,43.662231,-79.42499,"Latin American , Nicaraguan"

Soft, melting in your mouth kind of fish while the ceviche was rich, citrusy and so greatness! I think my favorite part of this restaurant was the quality of food, the portion size, for such a reasonable price. I mean granted mine was half salad, but it was FILLING. I mean REALLY filling. You definitely get your money's worth. Service was decent, and for a Tuesday night, it was semi full house. Always a good sign. Highly recommend ordering the ceviche mixed, and the pez dorado dish.

DaiLo,"Dailo loosely means 'big brother' in Cantonese, and is a term of endearment to show respect and love to an elder. They serve New Asian Cuisine that is predominantly Chinese fare but with French influences.We started off with a couple of cocktails. Mine was akin to an old fashioned, and Jenn's was a bit on the fruitier side. Both were quite good, though a bit strong. Shortly after our drinks, we were given a couple of Amuse Bouches.The amuse bouche was similar to the toppings of their crispy octopus tacos, topped with some sambal aioli and fresh peppers. It was delightful and a great start.Their crispy octopus tacos come with red braised pork belly, sambal aioli, on a jicama shell. This was probably my favourite thing of the night. The pork belly melted in my mouth, and all the flavours worked very well together. I could have done with another one of these!Next was their torched tamari glazed beef carpaccio. This was their Olliffe's rib cap, sliced thinly and served with a herb salad, nuoc mam, and topped with some prawn cracker. This dish is similar to a beef tataki. Tender pieces of beef went well with the salad. It was really refreshing and great to eat.  Next were their two different kinds of wontons/dumplings. They had a Hakka brown wonton, which was a pork/shrimp wonton, served with toasted sesame oil, their house made xo sauce, and an almond crumble. And their seasonal dumpling, served with local and fresh peas in a fragrant and delicious broth.  Chef Nick Liu has Hakka roots, growing up the son of Hakka parents. Both of these were delicious comfort foods and great to eat.The next dish was an eggplant dish that came with lightly breaded eggplant, served with spring onions, fresh cherry tomatoes, and topped with an inhouse aioli. A very light dish with perfectly cooked eggplant.  Lastly was the truffled fried rice that came with their 90 day-dry aged rib eye that comes with bok choy, radish, pickled mushrooms, black bean bagna cauda. These two dishes came together and the truffled fried rice really complemented the flavours from the beef.For a little sweetness at the end, they gave us a little bit of ginger sorbet, which was light, not too sweet, and a great way to end the meal.Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Dailo. The food was great, and the service was even better. Our server came and asked us what we liked and didn't liked so they could cater their tasting menu to our liking. There was a good variety of dishes, and I felt like it went a long way.

DaiLo,"DaiLo gets 3 stars for good ambience, great service and delicious cocktails. So what happened to the other 2 stars? Taste of the food and the price.  For $97, all we got was 2 cocktails, an order of wontons, beef carpaccio and charred Napa cabbage.  For $11, we got 6 pork and shrimp wontons that tasted just ok. The beef carpaccio was the best tasting dish. I love that it was loaded so many different herbs such as mints, cilantro, fried garlic and shrimp chips but the fish sauce was a bit too much making it a bit too salty. Getting to the most disappointing dish of the night, charred Napa cabbage.  For $15, we got 1/10 of a cabbage served with mayo!  I know it's Asian fusion food but mayo?!!?  Needless to say, it wasn't my cup of tea.  Perhaps, we picked the wrong dishes but then again, we were told we can't go wrong with any of the items in the menu.",4.0,3.0,180,2017-10-27,43.655808,-79.409905,"Chinese , Asian Fusion"

It is either done really well or really poorly.  This is why I am happy to report that DaiLo's fusion cuisine is done really well. The food was creative and inspired and prepared with finesse. We visited this restaurant as a group and decided to do a chef tasting menu. This is a great way to truly sample the various dishes at DaiLo. While all of the dishes were excellent, there were a few highlights, amongst them are: (1) the ""Big Mac"" bao, (2) the whole fried trout, and (3) beef plate.  The dishes were well presented, flavourful and fresh.

DaiLo,"/BOTTOM LINE: Chinese ""fusion"" done right. A great place to come if you want elevated Chinese classics, a cool space, and yummy cocktails./THE SPACE:Beautiful! There are lovely murals along the wall. One side of the restaurant is tables and the other side houses ""booths"". Bar in the back. /THE FOOD:I loved every bite of it. We ordered 6 dishes + dessert for two people, and we were more than full. Our waitress was thoughtful with letting us know how many dishes we should order, which was refreshing since I feel like I get ""upsold"" a lot and end up ordering too much food.- Fried winter melon with pork belly: So delicious, and reminded me of my childhood the minute I bit into it, as my weekday dinners were often winter melon soup. - Pumpkin dumplings - Very much like a wonton, but with creamy pumpkin inside and a sweet glaze (white rabbit candy!)- Truffle fried rice - $20+ fried rice should be delicious and Dailo delivered. Hints of (But not overdone) truffle, crunchy rice bits, and the homemade XO sauce were key.- General Tso sweetbreads - A refreshing take on a classic takeout dish. The sauce was a little salty, but I think it's just staying true to what general tso's chicken always is.Two specials:- Yu choy with fried garlic scapes/kimchi butter -- yummy, but kind of oily. The fried stuff was covered in tempura batter, which was great.- Singaporean oyster omelet - I love how the specials reflect the chef's recent travels. Amped up take on singaporean omelet with FRIED OYSTERS (?!?) on top. Overall, a fantastic restaurant. We had a lot of Chinese food while visiting Toronto but this stood out from the rest.

DaiLo,"DaiLo was an excellent culinary experience in a stylish setting.It doesn't look like anything special from the outside, but you'll understand my excitement once you walk in. The walls have beautiful, distressed Asian-style murals. The gold screens scattered around the dining room for privacy just barely glint in the low light. The skylight by the bar makes it glow like a gem at the heart of a cave. While this is all overly dramatic, it's also true. The food was excellent. My companion and I ordered the chef's tasting, which ended up being about 8 courses. They were glad to accommodate her dietary restrictions while serving me the planned tasting for the night, which was classy. They didn't compromise, either: all of her dishes were delicious. The portions were very large and exceeded my expectations - we couldn't finish everything. The service was good, but not quite as good as everything else. Our waiter was around a fair bit, but was hard to find a few times and we were made to wait to order drinks and to get the check.Overall, I highly recommend going to DaiLo and trying as much different food as you can.

DaiLo,"What to try:If you have the money, try the chefs table! For $65, you get to try 10 different items from their menu. And you get a flavour of almost every type of meat. But if you don't, I'd suggest the 90 day dry aged rib eye (look at my pics - rib eye?!? And it's medium rare?! Spells delicious!), the char Sui pork loin (very tasty if you like the char Sui sauce honey glazed kind of deal!) and the fried watermelon (because it's unique!)What to expect: place is generally very busy. Because of the poor acoustics of the place, it becomes really noisy and you are yelling most of the time or else good luck getting your message through to someone across the table! May not be the best place for a romantic intimate dinner if that's the case!Last tips: I say for chefs table, best to go with one or two ppl. When you go with more ppl, because it's a shareable platter instead of everyone getting their own separately, the portion sizes can get fuzzy. May feel like you got the same for two ppl at times but they say they try to top it up by giving more per platter and adding one or two more entrees with more ppl added to the party.

So I'm not going to recommend a specific dish, just put your trust in the chef's choice and prepare to have your head blown off. If you've travelled around Asia, you'll especially love dailo. So many flavours from all over Asia throughout the meal. It was like taking a trip through my favourite Asian memories, with a bit of Ontario blended in. I was entertaining a business colleague from Shanghai, China on his first trip to Canada and even he was blown away. And that says a lot, because he's a big foodie back home.

It felt like they tried way too hard to mix a bunch of ""Asian"" ingredients in interesting ways, but it just didn't work. Flavors felt very messy.  They used a lot of green onions and sesame oil and soy sauce, throwing in ""asian"" stuff like steamed egg or Chinese doughnuts.

In fact, most were just mediocre. A friend and I were in the area, contemplating where to eat since there are so many amazing restaurants within 10 min walk. I suggested DaiLo after hearing about it and seeing it everything. Downstairs was full so we opt for the snack bar - plus it was pretty late and I wasn't feeling a full meal.We ordered the Crispy Duck Wings, Big Mac Bao (?), Wontons, and a platter. Food overall was too salty, I had my water refilled a million times. Each dish was ""displayed"" neatly and thoughtfully, but for me, taste over everything else when it comes to food. The wings had too many things going on, plus too much salt, like it couldn't make up its mind. There was also too much sauce and barely any meat. Bao honestly tasted like Big Mac - pretty sick, but by no means it was delicious. I'd rather go to McD for an actual Big Mac. Maybe DaiLo's style doesn't match up with mine..Wontons and the platter (which i think also included the wontons) were just average.

DaiLo,"Everything about this restaurant is perfection! The food, the ambience, the service. Perfect for a date, a casual hangout or even  a small group party. They serve mostly tapas style food,  with the exception of a couple of bigger sized dishes. Between my date and I, we had 3 tapas sized,  and 1 regular sized dishes and we were stuffed! Here's what we had:1) Ponzu Beef Carpaccio - holy smokes this was so delicious. The combination of the yuzu soy caramel sauce,scallion,fried garlic and the dwarf peach (surprisingly) was amazing! 2) Miso Salt Cod Brendade - this is actually my favourite item on the menu so far. I can't describe how tasty it was, but the creamy texture of the Brendade combined with the crispy basil and the out of this world flavor from the salt cod - let's just say we had to ask for extra bread pieces. Ps my date is French and he approved! 3) seared Napa Cabbage - this was my least favourite of the items we ordered. Mind you, my date saw the word raclette and immediately ordered (did I mention he's French). Nothing really special with this dish, if you're not the biggest fan of cabbage and the raclette was almost absent4) Bulgogi glazed lamb neck -  eventhough we were so full, I'm glad we ordered this. It was absolutely a treat! The meat was tender enough you can pick them with your chopstick. It's served with a side of pear salad which was the perfect addition. The sweetness matched well with the puree and the lamb.  In addition to the food, what I think is really great about this restaurant is the service. Everyone were super helpful and friendly and there wasn't a time when I felt like ""oh, it's been awhile since we ordered"".

DaiLo,"I love their cocktails at this place! Delicious and inventive. The menu is a little challenging to understand at first. Without squeezing too much of your brain juice and help from the servers (they're awesome here by the way) you'll be on your way in no time in knowing what you'll want to try once they break it own effortlessly for you.This time round I tried the Singapore curry cauliflower . The portion came in larger than what I had expected. The taste was not too spicy and had a good amount of sauce. The char siew pork loin came with nice pairing of Asian pear mustard sauce with radish slaw and steamed buns. I would also recommend to try their sticky rice, something simple, but will done. Beware, do not over order as it's very filling.",4.0,4.0,180,2016-11-24,43.655808,-79.409905,"Chinese , Asian Fusion"
DaiLo,"Modern twist to Asian food in a warm antique setting!We were walking along College looking a quick bite prior to our show at 8PM - we passed by a couple of places when the sign outside caught our attention - ""Dailo and Lopan"". My initial thought was there must be typo but then my Chinese knowledge kicked in and brought a quick smile to my face as it was a neat word play. We didn't have reservations but said lets give it try which was the beginning of a great food adventure :)As we entered, a friendly host greeted and told us she could squeeze us in for a table of 2 beside the bar. The coat check was great as you didn't have lug around your jackets. Inside, the interior was dark wood flooring with neat box seats on side and open seating on the other. I loved the old fashioned wall paper which gave me a feel of 1920s Shanghai but updated. We sat by the bar on a high top table which had retro black and white photos on the wall. Our server was super friendly while offering free sparking or flat water.After explaining the menu, we were pleasantly surprised to hear that it was a ""tapas"" style menu with small plates and mains to share. So, on to the food:Starters:Hakka brown wontons - don't like the small bowl fool you in thinking it is just another dumpling. The wontons are coated in a gravy-like sauce that had a great pop in the mouth. Couldn't just eat one or two or even three :)Miso Salt Cod Brandade - initially we weren't quite sure what to expect as we thought this was going to like anchovies served on toasted bread but it was a wonderful dish. It was probably our favourite dish - anchovies + salt cod blended in to mashed potatoes topped with little fried fish. The dip went amazing with the traditional chinese bread! Scallops with vermicelli - this was one of the specials of the day where it was scallops in the shell topped with a seasoned vermicelli. Yummy!Main:Char siu pork lion - this was my 2nd favourite dish and server had a perfect description for it which was a deconstruced char siu bao :). The dish is served with two hot steamed buns which you then make up your own bao with the radish, pork lion and sauce. My first bite - wow - nice smokey and sweet flavours :). I've seen other places used pork belly (which is a bit too fat for me) so the pork lion had the right meat on it. Winner!Banana leaf grilled mackeral - our last dish was also the special which was a whole mackeral wrapped in a banana leaf and grilled to perfection. It is a whole fish so you need to be careful on bones but the fish was cooked exactly to ""fall off the bone"" with a spicy sauce. It was served with a side of coconut scented rice and salad. Definitely tasty!In all, we were super happy to have stumbled on Dailo and we'll definitely come back to try the tasting menu and dessert!",4.0,5.0,180,2016-11-21,43.655808,-79.409905,"Chinese , Asian Fusion"
DaiLo,"Enjoyed a new experience last night at DaiLo. Went with another couple and tried out the Chef's choice which is $55 per person (I believe the price has now gone up to $65 pp). Which is fairly pricey, but it's so worth it. The service is impeccable. The staff are so friendly and helpful. My partner has an allergy to crustaceans and the chef took that into account and created separate dishes for him.We had the Octopus tacos, Fried Watermelon, Pumpkin Dumplings, Hakka Wontons, Singapore Curry Cauliflower, Truffle Fried Brown Rice, Bulgogi Glazed Lamb Neck and the Jellyfish Slaw. I may have forgotten some of the dishes (oops!). It was one of the few times I didn't take pictures of a meal, despite the excellent presentation of food -- I WAS BEING PRESENT!Some of the food was much better than other dishes, but overall it was a hit. Our dining companions have been to DaiLo before and done the Chef's menu before as well. They love this place, and I can see why. The drinks are spot on too! I do think that $65 is a bit steep. But if you've got money to blow, and want a new experience, definitely check this place out. You get to taste a big chunk of the menu with the Chef's menu, which is a very nice way to explore the brand.",4.0,4.0,180,2017-03-22,43.655808,-79.409905,"Chinese , Asian Fusion"

The crust looked crispy but when I bite into it, it was doughy and almost underdone. There was very little ingredients on the pizza and dough to ingredient ration was seriously off.

Levetto,"Tip: check into the restaurant on Yelp for a free dessert! I ordered the pomodoro pasta which was a simple tomato sauce pasta cooked with olive oil and garlic. Flavour wise I thought it wasn't boring, which sometimes happens with simple tomato pastas, and quite tasty. The pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce coated the soaghetti noodles nicely. I think it's definitely worth trying for it's simple but rich flavour. Given the price you are paying for (~$9 for the dish) you're receiving a pretty big portion.I also used the Yelp check in function and got free dessert! Friends and I ordered most of the offered desserts and I tried the white chocolate tiramisu and coconut cake. The tiramisu was very underwhelming, presentation and taste wise. Maybe because I was expecting a traditional tiramisu layered dessert but this was just lady fingers stacked onto each other with some cream. I'm not complaining as it was free dessert, but if you were to pay for it I don't think it'd be worth it. The coconut cake on the other hand was delicious! It is a very dense, moist, and strong coconut flavoured cake. A bit heavy, but good to share with others. I'd recommend this!",4.0,4.0,201,2017-04-20,43.641743,-79.422051,"Italian , Pizza , Salad"
Levetto,"The food here is truly excellent. So delicious and a party to your tastebuds. The service is a bit slow (thankfully, we weren't in a hurry), but their friendliness and courtesy when they were actually around was appreciated. Overall, despite a few kinks, we really enjoyed our visit to this location. First, parking. There's a Green P located just west of the restaurant, and on a weekday, parking is $1.50 for every half hour before 7:00 PM. After 7:00 PM, the flat rate is $5.00. There's also lots of street parking available around the restaurant (if you can find a spot).Second, the food. Remember to 'check in' in the Yelp app - you get a free dessert! We ordered the Soppressata (Spicy) in half size ($7.00), the Carbonara ($12.50). We also ordered the Warm Brown Butter & Coconut Semolina Cake (free with the Yelp app). Overall, very tasty. The pizza had a wonderful kick, and although the bacon wasn't very crispy, the carbonara was delicious and hearty (heavy on the cheese). The coconut cake was quite decent, but a lot denser than I expected it to be - it's not fluffy at all, and the coconut flavours really stand out. Still, a pretty good meal!I guess our only issue was the service. They don't check on you very often, and we were confused about whether this is a self-serve restaurant, or a wait-service type restaurant (we still don't know - it was very confusing). We were waiting around 20 minutes to order until we gave up and went to the counter to order (we didn't know if we had to order ourselves, or wait for staff to come take our order). We also had to bring our own plates up to the counter ourselves - we weren't sure if we had to or not but did so anyway since no one came to take them. We were walked to our table when we first came in and introduced to a server, so we assumed it was a wait-service type experience. But, the rest of the evening felt very self-serve, and we weren't checked on during our meal at all. Not sure if it's supposed to be that way? Note: we were the only patrons in the restaurant.Anyway, service confusion aside, the staff themselves were very warm and courteous when they were around. And the food is definitely worth coming back for. A great casual spot for Italian fare - a solid 4 for the food.",4.0,4.0,201,2016-11-29,43.641743,-79.422051,"Italian , Pizza , Salad"

So many options were mentioned to me but being in T.O and aware that nice Italian food was probably all around, they had me at ""pasta"" (especially if it's homemade!). I'm not a big red sauce person so I ordered the Trecce, which was tasty. It wasn't super heavy or greasy and still had a healthy feel to it because of this. Anything with sundried tomatoes & goat cheese, you can count me in! It also had garlic infused olive oil, chili flake and arugula. The goat cheese helped pull it together and the sundried tomato gave it that flavor. Maybe not my favorite pasta bowl of all times but I still enjoyed it, and we ordered our food to go. Nice location. Small restaurant space but still enough to sit and eat. Next time I'd like to try their pizza! We were able to got free dessert with Yelp check-in, so that was a pleasant surprise!

The bacon gives it a smoky flavour, so definitely be back to try more of their pizzas.Bucatini - I love bucatini, and this one delivered. You can taste the difference of home made pasta versus store bought. The bucatini was cooked al dente, and the sauce was great. We couldn't ask for more, or perhaps...maybe guanciale :p but nonetheless a thumbs up!We also got their brown butter coconut cake on the house because we checked in on Yelp.

Free parking lot located behind the place which was very convenient. All the dishes we had (which was literally half of the menu) tasted great, not one bad dish I'd avoid, which was impressive! However, would like to note that their ""large plates"" are still actually very small and should be shared with no more than 3-4 people. Because of this, one might find it to be a bit pricier than expected, but nothing outrageously expensive. Our party was quite hungry and had to order a lot of repeat dishes so everyone could try a little bit. Tapas are more of an Asian vibe, and my favourite dishes were the grilled calamari and lamb curry spring roll, but honestly you can't go wrong with anything on their menu.

I could not resist to finish the whole plate by myself and which almost get into a fight with my partner.The appetizer gave us a good impression on their food and made us thrilled and excited for our main dishes. When my partner's Argentina style steak arrived, I was shocked by the price tag and meat selection they decided. It did not deliver the same quality with their $25 price tag. I hope they can change another style of meat or part, otherwise, it kills people satisfaction  instantly, especially when they earn high rating.Pad Thai, in general is blend and nothing in there really amazed me. My partner and I also did a little feedback for ourselves, we think probably we had a bit overhead expectation on a 4.5 star rating restaurant and in which it causes us feeling disappointed after all.

Mai Bistro,"First time at this place, and I felt like I have discovered a gem! The ambience is very cozy and sort of stylish, at least they try. It is very clean.Two of us on a summer Tuesday evening, and we ordered four small tapas, one large tapa (pad thai) and the viet pork tacos. All dishes taste fresh. The salad was so crispy, calamari comparable to top notch Italian restaurants. I also really enjoyed the organic options, since that was associated with a wellness initiative. I am currently waiting for the pad Thai as I am writing this review and already to rate 5 star just for the amazing service and taste. Tapas came one by one with almost no pause in between, which is impressive. It is a shame that this amazing restaurant only had a few customers, maybe it is the area (families not many single people that eat out often), maybe it's the timing being Tuesday night. I like this place better than susur lee's restaurants. Not only is the menu more inspired, but the price is also much more reasonable.  Thumbs up.",4.0,5.0,62,2016-05-24,43.649003,-79.528554,"Asian Fusion , Latin American , Tapas/Small Plates"

Lake Inez,"Ugghghghghg Lake Inez. Like, how are you this constantly delicious and WONDERFUL!?I was here again (second time, though frankly it should be my 222nd time) to celebrate the upcoming wedding of my BFF (that was also kinda the reason we first went there as well, actually). Anyhoo, I had some requests, as you often do before a small bachelorette type thing, and the staff were so friggin' wonderful and awesome. So before I even stepped foot inside, and opened my mouth to shove food in it, I was reminded about how great this place is. The service is solid and exceptional!So the food - SO GOOD. Not a single bad dish. Everything was ridiculously delicious. We ordered:Japanese Deviled Eggs - so good, and I even hate roe, but I super did not care, it was DELICIOUS.Honey Garlic Adobo Wings - I could live off these for months. Sticky, sweet perfection.Summer Corn Fritter - I've been super into corn lately, and this was really, really, really good.Housemade Spam ""Oshizushi"" - I think this was my favourite of the night. Everything was glorious, the flavours, the textures, all of it.Spicy Charred Broccoli - Superb, and it made me feel like I was being healthy. Winning combo!Salmon ""Sinigang"" - OMG the coconut polenta! SHUT UP AND GET IN MY MOUTH. The salmon was great too. BUT THE POLENTA.Sichuan-Style Lamb Pappardelle - Really good, but maybe the least loved of all the dishes. I mean we ate it all and it was delicious, but we didn't scrape all the bits from the plate into our mouths. Mushroom Pasta thing - ugh, so cheesy and good and creamy and mushroom-y and delicious.Roti - it was fine. Everyone else was all OMG THE ROTIIII, but I was all, meh it's tasty!We also drank the Nicholas Pearce 2015 Brut, which was lovely! And the Southbrook orange wine, which was really weird and interesting!Anyhoo, it was delicious, and I need to go back to eat there 507 more times. At least.

Lake Inez,"I really wanted to like this place considering I'm Filipino and was hoping the dishes would do it justice. It seems like such a popping place from the parties they host with an interesting flair, however I tried booking a table for 2 for a special birthday and then the night of - they didn't have my name on the list. It was funny in a sense because on the one hand, prior to that day I had a ""weird"" feeling come over me that I should probably call them to reconfirm my reservation. But on the other hand, I was like nahh let me give them the benefit of the doubt.. Why would I need to call?? The lesson - Never discredit your gut instinct because they never included my name for that night. Anyway, upon recognizing their error, they apologized, sat us down as soon as possible, and served us 2 glasses of champagne for free or something of that nature, I can't remember the drink. We ordered a bunch of food, that we both felt missed the spot when it came to having that Filipino flavour we were hoping to taste so I was a little bummed about that. The tables are very close by so it's not a very intimate setting, other than the dimmest light setting possible. The crowd is loud during peak times so talking to each other is kind of challenging if you're not used to projection. Needless to say, my throat was hurting at the end of the ordeal due to shouting on different levels I'm not used to and left unsatisfied from the food. I will give them a thumbs up for having some hearty, marinated meats that fall easily off the bone, but alas my search for unique but comforting Filipino dishes are still out there, other than a few dime a dozen joints in Toronto.",4.0,3.0,49,2018-01-27,43.672387,-79.320682,"Bars , Asian Fusion"
Lake Inez,"This is a 3.5 review not 3.This spot is tucked away in a far off land I like to call east, east side Toronto.  I had been dying to go and very happy I made the trek. It's a solid three for me for several reasons.  Although the food was good of the dishes that astounded me it was not what I anticipated for the cuisines influence. The chicken and duck liver mousse was incredible. Absolutely would order again. Flavour profile on point. Smooth, delicious yet not too rich. Paired well with the filipino bread of pandesal.  Another stand out was the sunchoke skewers. Usually not a big of fan of these but I am a believer if they could taste this good. Another fave was the roasted squash salad. An interesting combination of roasted acorn, pumpkin seed pesto, thai dressing and arugula. It had this spicy zing to it. Hard to explain but I almost would say this was a tie for my favourite dish.The pork skewers I have today were disappointing. It made my eyeballs roll back from something in the marinade that was excessive. It was the one dish I was completely looking forward and let me down the most.They ran out of the ingredients for the drink I had wanted so I settled for the Thai Gin Fizz. I couldn't finish it. Maybe it was the lime leaf infusion then more lime on top of it. Didn't seem to balance for me and somewhat turned me off drinking it. The ginger in it was fine but we definitely found it off.I will say super knowledgeable server. She knew her beer and the technicalities behind them to impress someone like me that knows nothing.Would I go back? Not sure.

Lake Inez,"Lake Inez was recommended to me and reviews were great, so we decided to come here with some friends.Food was flavourful but definitely overpriced.  The menu is limited with shared small and large plates.  With a group of six, we ended up ordering majority of the dishes (8 dishes in total).  Ambiance was very trendy, loud and many young adults.  The Asian decor and art gave the place a lot of character.  Service was mediocre and somewhat slow.  The waitress we had was not very attentive and she had forgotten to return to take our order at the beginning. She also didn't seem very informed about the menu. As for the food, I thought some of the dishes were very good, but I was still left a bit disappointed considering the amount paid. Some of the highlighted dishes were: Pork skewers, chicken wings, brussels sprouts, and ricotta donuts for dessert.  Striploin was good but too fatty which left very little meat; and the liver mousse was tasty, but the layer of fat was still hardened on top. Unfortunately, I likely will not return. There's potential for this place to improve on their dishes and service, but until then, will try elsewhere for Asian Fusion.",4.0,3.0,49,2018-01-07,43.672387,-79.320682,"Bars , Asian Fusion"

It was a fusion, yes, but it was so unique that I wish the serving size was bigger. The only downfall is the wait time was very long and the serving portion is too small. My most favorite part was the Ube Cheesecake. LIKE WOW. Words cannot explain that this is the best cheesecake I've ever tasted.

Lake Inez,"A small group of us came here on a Tuesday night and had a marvelous experience with the dishes. Since this restaurant is located in Little Indian community, one would wonder about the concept and the style of the dishes served here. Even though the person who organized this dinner had already given us a brief idea of what dining experience would be like, most of us were still questioning about the type of dishes that were listed on the menu, curious expectation were definitely set on most of our minds.Even the decor inside made the restaurant seem different why being set in the middle of the Indian and similar stores nearby.Our group sat at a spacious and cozy booth which gave some of us a good view of the ""lack of"" street life on Gerrad Street.And once our server with the character worth taking note of gave us the food and drinks menus, it did take awhile for some of us to decide on our choices. Many of the dishes involved different Asian cooking methods and some of them were familiar items that were given a different style of preparing them.A lot of the menu items sounded tempting so four people out of the group decided to share the $45 tasting menu while the rest of us order individual plates.For myself I picked the Dry-Aged Beef Lumpia, Chicken Liver Mousse accompanied by triangles of toasted Challah Bread and pairing of grilled Beef Short Ribs with the Malaysian Style Roti. I had been craving for most of these dishes so I wanted to see what the takes on all these items were.The filling for the Lumpias were delicately wrapped in wonton wrappers and came with a dip of Banana Ketchup, something that I didn't want to try when I used to live in the Philippines but that day it was a good chance to see what it tasted like and it was also made in-house. The presentation for the Chicken Liver Mousse was interesting because it came in a small mason jar and a thin layer of fat sealing it made it look like a scented candle. The mousse and the Challah bread were also accompanied by a clementine marmalade and a Szechuan chili oil. Combining all four of these items together resulted in an interesting combination of flavors. I do wish that the flavor of the chicken liver had been stronger in the mousse because the flavor of the marmalade overpowered it. But it was fun alternating between slathering the three items onto the Challah bread getting a slightly different taste each time. The short ribs looked similarly prepared in the Korean style of cooking Bulgogi or Galbi but the presentation for the dish was very impressive. Each portion of the short ribs came placed on the mashed kimchi which looked like a spicy sweet potato mash. The visual point of the presentation was a hefty bunch of Butter Lettuce leaves on the side. And the two plates that came out looked like decoration that are fixed on a Picture Hat, that graces the heads of women in picture on those magazines like Royalty and Majesty. And for people who have experience Korean BBQ dining, you simple ate the ribs by wrapping them up in the lettuce leaves with a bit of the accompanying condiments. The entire dish was just heavenly.Everyone in the group loved what they ate... until it was time for dessert and things took on a funny turn. The group who had the tasting menu also got to try the two desserts that were part of the courses: the Lemon Chiffon cake made with the Calamansi curd and the Coconut Meringue. Someone else also had the Lemon Chiffon cake and it was nice to see some specks of lime peel on the ""broken shards"" of meringue that garnished the cake pieces. The sorbet was served like a sundae with about four different toppings:caramelized bananas, pineapple chunks, roasted peanuts and chopped dried durian flesh. Most in the group tasted the cakes without much fuss. They either liked it or weren't so sure about the lemony flavors in the cakes and meringue. But it was the Coconut Sorbet that were got everyone taste buds shooting off on several different scales! While most of the other dishes were consumed alone by each person who ordered them, the Sorbet ended up being passed around the table so everyone could get a taste of it. It seemed that the flavors in the toppings sort of clashed instead of mingling well each other to result in one collective enhancing flavor. But the one thing that almost everyone agreed on was that the anticipated coconut flavor was absent from the sorbet and noone could really detect where the durian had ended up. So it was this dessert that got everyone just deconstructing and analyzing every flavor component in the entire dish. If it hadn't been for the lack of coconut flavor from the sorbet, this dessert would have probably saved itself from becoming an amusing disappointment.Our Server must have been chuckling inside while he was listening to the several feedbacks about the sorbet alone.I'd still go back to Lake Inez to share different plates with friends :-)",4.0,4.0,49,2017-01-30,43.672387,-79.320682,"Bars , Asian Fusion"

Our favourites were the BBQ pork skewers and the beef short ribs. Both of them were very tender and juicy - highly recommend. The rest of the dishes were good but nothing exceptional for the price.

Great flavours, a solid Tom yum. Chicken was tender too! Definitely filling enough for lunch, especially because you are supposed to drink the soup! But by the time I was done eating all the chicken and noodles, I was already too full to drink all of the soup!  Dinner - royal thai platter is a must for appetizer, really enjoyed trying the four different kinds of Thai dumplings, all uniquely flavoured! For mains, we shared the khao yum, gaeng boombai , and kua hang gai. My favourite was the gaeng boombai which is short rib beef in something like curry. The beef falls off the bone and the sauce was amazing. We ordered some rice berry (sort of like purple rice) on the side, and those were some super awesome tasting rice, like I can eat it alone. I didn't really like the taste of kua hang gai, but that's just my personal taste. Overall great dinner!

They are little dumplings with each having a distinct taste and flavour! We also ordered the beef curry and the tofu with mushrooms. We ended up ordering a side of sticky rice and roti to go with the curry. Each dish was spectacular! I feel like these dishes are not as common in other Thai restaurants.

Kiin,"Came here on a weeknight without a reservation for a table for 4. Luckily, the timing was early enough that the restaurant can accommodate us to get seated around 5:30-6:00pm and we were able to keep the table until almost 7:30pm before their reserved guests arrive. Location: This is a familiar location where some of you may have seen that it was where Khao San Road used to be. The doorway is on the side but you walk into a completely different layout of the same space. Atmosphere: love the decor! Great vibe to this place. They took the time to make the place really a nice mix with vintage/modern feel. Love the tiling around the walls (those hexagonal wall tiles) and little details such as the halfway-painted black light bulbs on the ceiling that my friend and I noticed. Wonder if that's why this place is still so dim even with all those light fixtures on the ceiling. I must say, it is really loud in here once the place is busy -- Although I was sitting in a cozy table of 4-- I felt like I couldn't hear what was said by my friend across from me. The space between each table /group was perfect. It wasn't too cramped but I must say that this place isn't very big. It is not going to be as easy a few large party groups. Perfect for smaller tables though. Service: Friendly service and attentive staff. They changed our plates when our mains came (probably because she overheard that I made a comment about my friend's DIRTY PLATE for jokes). But that kind of attentiveness definitely merits my appreciation. They were great to share some of their food recommendations since our whole group was first to try this place. Food: 2 pages of food options. Honestly, I thought I'd had more selection for their dinner menu. I was actually craving your typical thai noodles and rice for dinner. However, I guess I should have looked up the dinner menu before coming to a surprise for our meal. This place is known to be a shared experience. We were able to order several small dishes and mains to be split with our group. Starters: Royal Thai app- colourful and cute arrangements of peanut infused small bite size apps. I'm a big fan of plating and décor. It is a bonus if the plate looks pretty and appealing!The bite size items came in pairs -- obviously for a group of 4 , they recommended that we order 2 of those plates, but we were happy just to order 1 plate to try for starters. I think it was OK and fun to try a taste and appreciate the plating to start off our night -- but I'll pass next time because each bite was semi sweet/salty peanut infused taste and if you eat it in the order they recommended, you eat the fried dumpling at the end! Still very happy I tried it though!Pomello salad - my mom makes this type of salad pretty often and so I have a very familiar taste when I eat this. If you have never had it, it is a mix of shredded pomello, crushed peanuts, some chilli flakes/sauce and the key ingredients are the special thai sauce (which is both sweet and sour flavours). They served this on a bed of lettuce and the waiter said we can eat the salad as a wrap or just eat it separately! I enjoyed this refreshing salad very much because I don't often order this at restaurants. THe flavours were also unique since it had incorporated lemon grass and coconut flakes. ALSO-- LOTS OF shrimp were in this salad to enjoy. Pork jowl- THIS WAS GOOD GOOD! The waitress described the flavours correctly. It has a bit of a smoky flavour to it. If you haven't had pork jowl before --- it is the portion of the pig's neck -- always a fan of eating and cooking this type of meat. It has a good chewy yet tender type of texture. But this dish had so much good spices and seasonings that make it just a little spicy, strong onion taste and a hit of smoky flavour. It is recommended by the chef to alternate with the thai kale served with this dish as well. If eating the thai kale on its own, my friend described the taste as ""raw broccoli"". But I dunked my kale into the sauce of the dish and mixed it with the onions and peppers to get all the flavours for my plain veggie wrap!Khao Yum - Lots of tables ordered this big bowl of colourful and finely chopped ingredients! They mixed it for you at the table. This was fun to watch them mix as their pour all their sauce at your table. I really didn't know what I was eating (not your typical rice dish). It was not served hot either but a nice mix of textures in your mouth when you share. Definitely the portion was large enough to share with 4 people. I would say it would be too much for 2 people to share since you want to make sure you leave room to try the other dishes. My FAV -- Curry braised beef with ROTI side order - THIS was sooo good!The beef was braised for 12 hours they say to make it fall off the bone and just full of flavour. The curry was so delish! The roti was perfect for me since it was very light, flaking and stayed crispy. Will not need to order the pandan or matoo thai tea!",4.0,4.0,93,2017-11-17,43.647622,-79.3921,Thai
Kiin,"If you're a Thai Food lover, you would be familiar with the husband and wife team Chef Nuit & Jeff Regular's empire of Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto namely Sukhothai, Pai, Sabai Sabai and the new restaurant Kiin.Kiin which means 'eat' in Thai occupies where Khao San Road is situated before. Upon entering the restaurant, you will be greeted in Thai by a very nice and friendly host.  You can already tell this is no ordinary Thai restaurant judging by how the interior looks. The place itself is so lush and gorgeous with marbled floors, glass shutters and gold accents everywhere. It also looks more spacious as compared to when it was Khao San Road.The lunch menu is very limited which consist only of three choices in different categories such as Snack, Soup, Salad, Rice, Noodle, Curry.I decided to try a noodle dish, Pad See Ew to see if they taste authentic - and damn right it is! They got it right with the sauce, perfect balance of salty and sour. It has also has a wonderful chargrilled flavour from a result of continuous high heat cooking. And the Sen Yai noodles - so fresh and chewy. I just wish they would give you more of the noodles as the dish has more veggies and chicken than noodles.My SO ordered the Tom Yum Gai with Konjac Noodles. Konjac Noodles if you're not familiar is also known as the 'Wonder Noodle' because it has no starch so it's no fat, low carb, low cal and gluten free. Be warned that they don't ask you for the spiciness level and it is a little bit spicy. But boy it was good! The broth has all the exotic Thai flavours and the chicken was so tender.  This is comparable or even better to the Thai street foods we ate in Bangkok.If you also like Pandan, you should try their Pandan Ice Tea. It's not sweet but with the addition of pandan leaves, this drink is so fragrant and I really enjoyed it. Although it's pricier compared to other Thai resto, the portions are huge and they don't skimp on the ingredients. Plus if you want quality food, the price doesn't really matter.Once again, the Regular's have proven that when it comes to authentic Thai food nothing beats them. You don't even have to travel to Thailand to eat authentic Thai food since Toronto has the best Thai restaurants! I will surely come back here to try their dinner menu and also to recommend this restaurant to friends and families.",4.0,4.0,93,2017-11-07,43.647622,-79.3921,Thai
Kiin,"This was my second visit to Kiin, but this time was for lunch. I decided to order the khao kha moo, not really knowing what it was. It was delicious. The ingredients seem very much inspired by some of the Chinese food I've tried in the past. I mean, just look at those impeccable yu choy! The braised pork was incredible. It was so soft and tender. The five spice broth on top of the rice was delicious. I'm glad that they give you additional broth in a cup because I just poured it all over. The dish comes with pickled mustard greens that I didn't like that much and the sour sauce was very spicy.I tried the pandan iced tea in the past, so this time I wanted to try something different and ordered the matoom iced tea. It's described as nutty, honey, sweet. It was definitely an interesting flavor. I found it to have a hint of menthol-like flavor. Of the two, I enjoyed the pandan much more.",4.0,4.0,93,2017-10-29,43.647622,-79.3921,Thai
Kiin,"A very different experience for Thai food. The restaurant is small and cozy. I loved all the decor and thought that our waitress was very good with recommending dishes for the table. Overall, I enjoyed the fact that all the flavours here were very refined. We ordered the following:-Root vegetable chips with tom yum spice - recommended appetizer and honestly, if you're a fan of Tom yum, you'll like this a lot, there was a variety of different vegetables (taro, squash, etc) -Mussels - I am a big fan of mussels and honestly, this was right up my alley with the lemongrass flavour-Chuchee Tofu and Mushroom - I loved the flavour of the curry which we paired with some naan but the tofu and mushroom was just a big bunch on mush in my opinion- Gaeng  Boombai Nua (beef short rib) - I don't really remember how I felt about this dish to be honest but the meat was tender and off the bone.Overall, the dining experience was nice but I found the place quite pricey and portions weren't huge. We found ourselves having to order some rice and two naan side dishes to use with the main dishes.",4.0,3.0,93,2017-09-24,43.647622,-79.3921,Thai
Kiin,Great friendly staff! Called to made reservations in the past & they are very good at calling customers back if they missed the call! Favorite was the beef curry - meat fell off the bone & the roti is a must get! Roti is flaky and fresh to order. Lobster tom yum was not great however - didn't taste the sour and spicy tom yum and it was overly salty. Overall good experience though!,4.0,4.0,93,2017-12-19,43.647622,-79.3921,Thai

BECAUSE I ENDED UP BOOKING THE ONE IN NEW YORK. so please BOOK ON YELP Anyways, the food was so good. The aesthetic is extremely on point and really really beautiful. Every single dish is carefully hand crafted. From their royal dumpling platter with natural colours and exuberant flavour ranging from sweet to savoury to their extra tender Gaeng boombai naeng, every plate was perfect. The service here is polite, friendly and attentive. They give great recommendations and are very genuine and take great care of you.

Kiin,"Think of Kiin as an new Thai experience to be savored versus the typical carb-heavy food run to your neighborhood Thai joint. The attention to detail is in every aspect, from their amazing food, excellent service, and aesthetic atmosphere. The space isn't big, which means less seats but it's been lovingly decorated in shades of gold, pink and green. Everything is meant to be beautiful and detailed, which sums up to a an amazing dining experience.The food reflects their aesthetic. Their Royal Dumpling Platter is an excellent example of their dedication to detail. Each dumpling had it's own distinct flavor and texture, and there was obviously alot of thought and attention placed on making each one, even when each one could all be devoured in a bite or two. The Pork Jowl dish was cooked perfectly, so the meat was on that fine line of being chewy, crisp and soft all at the same time. It was my favorite dish of the night based solely on texture and flavor. Lastly, the Salted sea bream was a new way to experience fish. We watched them laborously debone the fish and it was presented to us with the little pockets of lettuce and toppings to eat with. It was light, fresh and full of contrasting textures and flavors.A new level of Thai dining!",4.0,5.0,93,2017-09-15,43.647622,-79.3921,Thai
Kiin,"Lunch menu is very limited, with your choice of either a build-your-own soup noodle or choose from about 3 rice or other noodle dishes. I picked the Khao Moo Grob, which the menu described as crispy pork with jasmine rice and roasted pork gravy. It also came with a side of a dark vinegar sauce, which wasn't mentioned on the menu but wasn't unwelcome nonetheless. But the pork? Dryest pork you could ever get. It was so dry it was difficult to chew and even harder to swallow (it literally clung on for dear life to the sides of my throat and I made a silent prayer not to accidentally choke-cough it out into my boss's face). Gulping down the matoom (quince iced tea) fared no better for me - it's probably purely personal preference, but I didn't enjoy the taste, which reminded me of freezer-burned ice. On the other hand, I had a taste of one of the noodle soups and it was fine. If you're still curious to try Kiin, I'd suggest going only if you're not in a rush - as Kiin is still in soft-opening mode, service is extremely slow (waited 30 mins for lunch). There are a lot of kinks at Kiin...here's hoping they work them out.",4.0,2.0,93,2017-07-06,43.647622,-79.3921,Thai
Kiin,"Great place for meeting friends. Very nice deco and definitely not your ordinary Thai place! Highly recommend the grilled fish, lettuce wraps and everything else. A recommendation: make a reservation.

Kiin,"I visited Kiin's lunch service on a Wednesday. I was able to get a seat at the bar without wait. The menu is pretty simple; you build your own noodle soup, or pick among the rice dishes. I ordered a Ma Naew (spicy, sour and peanut soup) with Sen Buk, BBQ pork. The service was friendly and the waitress gave me some good recommendation. It was a little wait for my noodle soup to arrive, but I could tell the reason because they made the soup and noodle fresh. The wait was totally worth it because the Ma Naew soup was very aromatic and well balanced between the spicy and sour flavourful. I drank it all at the end. The BBQ pork was tender and juicy. The lady next to me ordered the Yen Tao Fo with Sen Yai (flat rice noodle) was so aromatic and looked very tasty. I will order it next time. In conclusion, Chef Nuit never disappoints. Although the price point ($14) is a little high for a bowl of noodle soup, the quality is worth that price point. And the restaurant decor is so beautiful and classy. It will be a perfect for lunch / dinner dates.",4.0,4.0,93,2017-07-07,43.647622,-79.3921,Thai
Kiin,"Kiin is not your average Thai cuisine - it is wonderfully more upscale and the dishes are definitely much more high end than the typical Thai offerings elsewhere.When I heard Kiin was opened by the same people who run Pai, Sabai Sabai and Sukothai, I had really high expectation as those are some of my favourite places. I was not disappointed!For my first visit, I started my meal with a delightful Royal Thai platter, consisting of 4 delicious and delicate looking Thai dumplings. The platter starts with dumplings on the sweeter side and you work your way to the savoury one. Even though some would say it is quite small for a $12 dish, I thought it was perfectly reasonable considering how great it tasted and how much work it must have taken to make these delicate morsels.The pork jowl was another wonderful and tasty dish - I simply love the meat texture, and the flavour was incredible. Thai kale stalks are provided on ice as a palate cleanser between bites, and they were wonderfully crunchy. Yum!My first meal was so good, I decided to go back with some friends a week later! We ordered some bigger dishes this time. Most notable was the Khao Yum, which probably is one of the most pretty salads you'll see. It's got different coloured jasmine rice mixed with lemongrass, long beans, coriander, lime leaves, pomelo, sprouts, edible flowers and tamarind-soy sauce. A great sharing dish!The Yum Tua Plu (wing bean salad with chili shrimp paste) was wonderful also, and I love the crunchiness of the wine bean.The braised short rib was fall off the bone tender and the sauce was super tasty. I would highly recommend it as well.The only miss for us was the sea salt-crusted sea bream. Even though the fish itself was cooked perfectly (not dry), we thought it was a bit gimmicky and most of the flavour was from the provided Kale leave and sauce mix. A bit pricey at $32 IMO.Overall, I really loved Kiin and I look forward to seeing what other dishes they might come up with next if they ever refresh their menu.",4.0,4.0,93,2017-07-13,43.647622,-79.3921,Thai
Kiin,"This is such a beautiful place that does some lovely, beautiful and delicious dishes. My friend and I were lucky enough to walk in and get a table on a Friday night, around 6:15. The service here was excellent, as we felt well-attended to the entire time. All of the staff were very friendly and took the time to describe each of the dishes that were presented to us.We ordered presumably their most popular and/or visually appealing dishes. The Roy Thai platter included four beautifully presented dumplings of varying colours, each with their own unique flavour profiles. I enjoyed the first two (you are supposed to eat them in a specific order) slightly sweet dumplings the most.The roasted pork jowl was very, very flavourful but perhaps on the touch heavy side. On the one hand, I actually enjoyed the slight bit of heat the dish had - it was not too overwhelming for me. On the other, I did find the dish to be a bit too salty.The khao yum was our final dish of the night, which featured colourful, naturally dyed piles of rice mixed with lots of vegetables, sprouts, edible flowers and leaves, etc. and presented in a large gold wok. Although the portion seems large, I would caution that it's not actually as filling as you would expect, given the overwhelming ratio of veg to rice.I also got a pandan iced tea which was again visually stunning with layers of colours. Cocktails seemed a bit pricy.Definitely a really unique Thai dining experience, as the items on the menu are rarely found elsewhere. I love the opulence of the ""Royal Thai"" dining style and felt like a queen the entire time - I thoroughly enjoyed every second and would love to come back!",4.0,4.0,93,2017-08-29,43.647622,-79.3921,Thai
Kiin,"Royal appetizer was our favourite thing to order. Not ideal for sharing because you get four tiny but delicious assorted pieces. Our favourite piece was the small wonton. I wanted 100 more after! We also ordered the Mieng Pla (Sea salt-crusted whole sea bream with Thai garlic, Thai basil, finger mint, peanut, ginger, shallot, and lime in Thai kale leaves) - This dish was light and refreshing. Nothing was wrong but it missed the spot for me. It wasn't my cup of tea. Sometimes your bite can be quite salty. But our favourite main was the savoury Gaeng  Boombai Nua (Braised AAA Wellington County beef short rib with tamarind, field cucumber, and pearl onions). When it comes to our mains, savoury is the way to go. It was tender and fall off the bone. Even the way it looked with a giant bone looked majestic! The place was beautifully decorated.

Kiin,"4.5 star ... incredible new restaurant with definite potential to be a 5 star Wonderful elevated Thai cuisine ... this is a place to enjoy a different variation of the country's vast offering.  I haven't had many dishes from central Thai or made with royal Thai recipes so this was a great way to experience it without a 15 hour flight.The restaurant is small but it is really well done... The frontage is a bold and beautiful wooden mosaic that captures your attention.  Inside is lots of beautiful light coloured surfaces with bright natural sun.  It is a refined restaurant.  Not stuffy or pretentious... upscale casual perhaps?  There are not many big tables... only one where you can sit maybe 8.  The rest are small tables and the bar can fill about another 10 at most.  We were seated at the bar for our dinner and I dont mind it as you can see how they make their wonderful drinks.  My only complaint about the space... the bar stools... no backs!  Not that it is needed but it would be nice. We were greeted and shown to our seating immediately ... zero wait.  One thing I noticed, there were many many people turned away.  Reservations are a must here!  The bar is managed by 2 people and they were our waiters.  They were incredibly knowledgeable of every dish and seemed to have eaten every one at least once to know exactly what the offering is like.  Please note... this isnt your lunch special $8.99 ketchup Pad Thai place.  This is refined Thai cuisine with lovely nuanced flavours that let you enjoy a lot of fresh ingredients that are well prepared.  One thing to note, it is still a soft open... which surprised me a bit.  Instead of expanding the dinner menu to more seafood preparations (lobster and crab supposedly) and more desserts (only a fruit platter for now), they are going to do a lunch first and be comfortable with that.The staff recommended one small plate and one larger per person to share... the entire menu is meant for sharing except the Royal Platter with the 4 dumplings.  We had 2 orders of the Royal Thai Platter, Mussels, Pork Jowl small plate, and the larger salt baked Sea Bream.  I feel this was just a tad too much food but I had a moderate appetite.  Royal Thai Platter - Incredible presentation.  Gorgeous colours are a feast for the eyes.  If you're familiar with dim sum, they're similar with thin wrappings steamed or fried.  The big difference is size... these Thai dumpling are about half the size of normal dim sum items.  Quite petite but they pack a punch of wonderful flavours.  The first is a pineapple with a savoury, salty, and sour pickled vegetables.  My favourite was next which is the purple one... roasted coconut hits your tongue and then you taste the peanut, onion, pickled vegetables, and a roasted rice flavour.  We learned this purple dumpling can be ordered by itself for 6 dumplings itself for the same price of the 4 unique ones.  The last two had meat in them and were a nice contrast of flavours.  Delicate but still wonderful to try. 5/5Mussels - Another great presentation of the tower holding the mussels and then it's discarded shells.  It comes with an amazing but potent lemongrass and citrus chilli sauce.  I drizzled that on everything for the entire night!  The mussels were tender and soaked in all the broth.  It was very good. 5/5Pork Jowl - I found this one not to my liking... I know jowl is supposed to be a fatty cut but I found it too fatty and chewy (instead of tender) even though they already trimmed it and then render the fat out by grilling it.  It just wasn't my thing.  Others enjoyed it but for me, I could handle only one bite. 3/5Sea Bream - Another stunner... the whole salt baked Sea Bream was presented to you first before being deboned in the kitchen.  Word of caution, they dont get all the bones so be careful!  It arrived with an incredible platter of Thai Kale and leaves with vermicelli, basil, mint, and ginger plated all ready for the moist pieces of sea bream.  The sea bream had a very lovely soft delicate flavour that reminds me of a really nicely steamed fish.  If you want a bit more punch and heat, the platter comes with the spicy citrus sauce that gives you that heat that brings everything alive.  Overall, just a wonderful dish. 4.5/5At this point, I was quite full even though not eating any of the Pork Jowl.  It is much more than the other Chef Nuit offering (Sabai Sabai and Pai) but this is a completely different restaurant with a considerably more effort in each dish.  They do shine and the staff here is very attentive and welcoming.Overall, a big winner... one of my favourite Thai places in Toronto and even though I didnt like one dish, I'd be ready to come back and try another one in its place easily.  A definite 4.5 star place with room to be a top 5 star place.",4.0,4.0,93,2017-06-11,43.647622,-79.3921,Thai
Kiin,"The highly anticipated opening of Chef Nuit and Jeff Regular's latest restaurant, Kiin, is finally here! Kiin, Thai for ""eat"" will truly bring the taste of Thailand to Toronto. The duo behind Sabai Sabai, Pai and Sukhothai have shifted from their Northern Thai food focus to introduce a variety of traditional Thai dishes that can be found all over Thailand.  Chef Nuit  says that the menu draws from experiences she's had growing up and travelling across Thailand where food sharing is an important part of the culture.  A few of the dishes on the menu also take inspiration from Royal Thai cuisine which is pretty much extinct in Thailand.  However, Chef Nuit learned many of the techniques while in Thailand which attribute to very intricate, delicate and beautifully prepared dishes.The menu features a mix of local and imported ingredients, allowing guests to experience the different flavours of Thailand. Ingredients such as white turmeric, buffalo basil, wing beans and angled gourd are just a few of the unique additions to Chef Nuit's creations.My favourite dishes were the Royal Thai Platter, Wing Beans, Braised Short Rib and Sea Bream.  However, I really did enjoy every single dish I tried and was super impressed by the different flavours and presentation of the food. Not only is the food incredible, but the space at Kiin is beautifully designed and intimate, with a capacity of 35.  Whether you're here for lunch or dinner, you'll be truly amazed by every aspect of Kiin.Kiin will be open for lunch and dinner service and is located at 326 Adelaide Street West. Hours of operation are Monday to Friday from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm for lunch, Monday to Sunday from 5:00 pm to 11:00 pm for dinner.",4.0,5.0,93,2017-06-05,43.647622,-79.3921,Thai

It is a little on the pricey side but worth it!,4.0,5.0,17,2017-11-02,43.705676,-79.375444,Mediterranean

Mayrik,"Visited on a Saturday evening. We really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant and the service was great! The dumplings were incredible and the cocktails were also good but unfortunately the main meal was underwhelming. We had the chicken which was burnt and not well seasoned and the cauliflower and potatoes as sides (both were good but again, nothing special).We would return but only for appetizers and drinks.",4.0,3.0,17,2017-10-02,43.705676,-79.375444,Mediterranean
Mayrik,"It's been a long time since I enjoyed a meal so full heartedly or planned my immediate next visit. I had heard the food was good here, but always a skeptic I needed to eat to believe! And the hype is well earned! We had the Mante (Armenian meat dumplings) which could have been a meal unto itself. Delicious. The Fatoush salad was seasoned differently than expected but still yummy. The Mis (meat) was done well and serving was generous. Same for Hav (chicken) it's a half chicken so sharing a must. Didn't get dessert. Prices are fair for quality and serving - - will return. It's beyond busy on a Saturday night and so noise is high - but no complaints there. A must-visit!",4.0,5.0,17,2017-11-05,43.705676,-79.375444,Mediterranean
Mayrik,"Let me say at the outset I grew up on Lebanese food, so I am biased to flavours I'm accustomed too!   Mayrik is a very good restaurant! There are some standout components. First and foremost the service was fabulous! The consensus was that the bread and two of the dishes were really excellent. The fatoush and the roasted cauliflower , superb.. The baba ganoush had a wonderful texture but it had a sweetness to it  that we didn't love. Mante dumplings were tasty, but I was terribly disappointed to discover the kibbeh nayeh was made with beef and not lamb. The lamb chops were also OK but nothing I can't make myself at home. The wine being Armenian was foreign to me, it was fine but not for $60. Unfortunately not much else to choose from on the wine list. We also found a $200.00 total was a bit much. The overall environment is crisp, clean and comfortable. So I say give it a try, I know you will enjoy your meal and it may suit your palate perfectly!",4.0,3.0,17,2017-10-15,43.705676,-79.375444,Mediterranean

Yummy Korean Food Restaurant,"Finally! Found the perfect Korean restaurant. Greeted from the second we walked in. The place was very busy and was expecting a bit of a wait. Thankfully a table opened up immediately and was sat down quickly. The hostess very prompt in her service and ensured that we had both tea and water at the table. Ordered the pan fried veggie dumplings, tofu bibimbop and the pork bones soup. Without getting into too much detail, the portion size was huge and the flavours were spot on.

This is one of the few places that serve honey garlic potatoes, which I can get never get enough of! There is a jug of water that is placed on the table so that you don't have to constantly call over the waiter or waitress to refill your cup. The place is always reasonably busy, but there is always a seat available so you don't have to wait to be seated. I ordered the Chicken Katsu and the sesame sauce on top of the katsu was very refreshing. The portion is a bit big as they give you a lot of chicken.

Yummy Korean Food Restaurant,"Note before reading: I pretty much handle anything I touch with care (note I am a baker). I ordered take-out and I walked from the restaurant (boxes upright) all the way to Bathurst station. When I got to Yonge/Bloor station i was  but the bottom of the plastic bag. There goes 1/3 of the food - the sauce which mixed with rice is EVERYTHING. For $8 I probably shouldn't complain, so I'd rather make a kind suggestion to the restaurant. For your saucy-dishes, put the non-rice food into a soup container to preserve your food.Pretty disappointed. For a dollar more ($9+Tax) you can get 1.5x the size of this portion for the same meal at Sunrise house (south side of Bloor closer to PAT supermarket)You learn from your mistakes I guess. I just wanted to try this place for the first time cuz I heard it has the same food as my usual go-to korean restaurant, Sunrise but it was slightly cheaper.",4.0,1.0,169,2017-11-05,43.664625,-79.414083,Korean
Yummy Korean Food Restaurant,"What to try?They are known for their sweet and sour Korean fried chicken.The chicken was tasty and unlike Chinese sweet and sour chicken, the Korean version's sauce is lighter in colour and they added some spice powder but the dish is not spicy. Chicken are not fried like nuggets but rather as strips of chicken. The dish is pretty big so you can share with at least two ppl. If you order more food, rmb you hv side dishes too! I realized that each Korean restaurant makes their gamja tang or their porkbone soup a little bit differently. But the general ingredients are the same. I liked their porkbone soup too but it's different from other restaurants in that it did not come with potatoes. Still, a soup to have with a meal is always good!Last tip?Don't be afraid to order more side dishes again. It's okay to order another round of the side dishes if you really like it, but of course don't go overboard reordering the side dishes multiple times!",4.0,4.0,169,2017-07-29,43.664625,-79.414083,Korean

My favourite items to order are the bibimbap, sweet and sour chicken, chicken cutlet, potato pancake, and deep fried dumplings. Is that a long list? Yes. My point is that you honestly can't go wrong with this place, everything tastes amazing and none of my friends have ever had a single complaint. And also the side dishes are really good too!! Especially the potatoes and the small green pancakes, I'm getting hungry just thinking about this place.

Yummy Korean Food Restaurant,"A great Korean restaurant to curb any Korean food craving. Came here a little before 11 on a Sunday and they were already open. It smelled a little like bleach but I assumed it was because they were just getting ready in the morning. It dissipated and we stopped noticing it shortly after sitting down. We ordered the kalbi BBQ and the kimchi soup (#68). The service was very slow and it always took a while to get the waiters attention since she wasn't hanging out up front. The side dishes were all spot on and they served all the dishes that I love including bean sprouts, potatoes, kimchi and glass noodles. The new dish that I have never seen before is this green starchy pancake like dish that was so good. The kalbi was really fatty but had a good taste. The kimchi soup was a good taste and had a lot of ingredients inside including cuts of beef. They also served us hot barley tea when we asked for hot water which was really a nice surprise.

Seeing that Yummy has a menu out front with photos of all the plates and it was open, it was a winner. When we walked in we were seated right away. The menu has a ton of options to choose from. The best part being the photos of all the food. If your eyes are bigger than your stomach this is always a plus. I went with the vegetable dumpling soup. When our food came out they also brought out 5 mini plates of sides. The portions of the actual meals were huge! My soup was incredible! The sides were also very delicious. The best part was if you finished a side dish they'd just bring you more of it! Overall, the food was very inexpensive and incredibly delicious.

Yummy Korean Food Restaurant,"If you are looking for yummy kfood while on a budget, I totally recommend this place as a contender. Went on a Saturday night around 6-7pm and it was packed. Had to wait 10 minutes for a table and saw ppl waiting even longer after I arrived. I had the #56 - spicy bulgogi and squid on hot plate for $10.95, while my friend had the #66 - KamJa Tang, pork bone soup for $6.95. For my dish, I asked if it can be mild but I thought it was pretty spicy. It was good, but it was so salty and spicy that I basically gulped down 1 whole water jug. I would probably go for the regular bulgogi on hot plate next time. As for my friend, they wanted no spice as it was an option on menu. But beware if you order #66, staff said they cannot do no spice but mild at best. The pork bone soup was quite generous in portion though, had about 3-4 big pieces of meat and some potatoes. I tried a little and found the meat tender. The side dishes also had a lot in variety, offerings pancake, kimchi, radish kimchi, sweet potato, glass noddles, and cooked bean sprouts. I loved the pancake and sweet potato especially! Definitely would return considering the great price point, side dishes and portions.",4.0,4.0,169,2017-02-26,43.664625,-79.414083,Korean

Yummy Korean Food Restaurant,"(2.5*)I absolutely HATE the green in this restaurant because it kills my eyes and the server that night gave rally bad vibes but their gamjatang makes up for it for only $7. Upon entering me and my frend wanted to sit by one of the larger tables but the server was really rude about us choosing to do so saying ""No don't sit there that is table for 5"" and it's like 10:30 p.m. !?!??? I bet my entire life savings a group that big is NOT going to walk in and need those EXACT seats. Well whatever, but he didn't have to be so rude about it.We ordered Ribs, Gamjatang (Pork Bone Soup), and Rice Cake & Fish Cake Ramyun and our side dishes like never came out before our dishes like literaly EVERY KOREAN PLACE IVE BEEN TO does, except this one of course. So we were starving for a solid 20-25 minutes with only waterGamjatang (7/5)Damn this dish was a homerun because the broth was so flavourful and the meat literally fell off the bone as soon as I touched it with my chopsticks. This is a must get anytime of the day, anyday.Ribs (3/5)Kind of oily? It wasn't grilled I'm 100% sure because the last few bottom pieces were just KINDA DRIPPING with oil and there were no grill marks at all. Meh, decent flavour but would rather just go down the street towards christie station for better ribs.Rice cake & Fish cake Ramyun (1/5)THIS PLATE HAD LIKE 5 SLICES OF RICE CAKE AND 3 SLICES OF FISHCAKE ARE YOU JOKING. Only upside was that the ramyun was cooked perfectly thats it. This plate was actually a waste of money. If I wanted ramyun like this it would've costed be a solid dollar at CPAT.Verdict: Only ever coming back here for the gamjatang, after the two misses from the other two dishes and complaints from other reviews about how ordinairy the bibimbap is, not willing to risk the other fails they might have up their sleeve.

I felt bad for the server because she said her manager would deduct her pay if I didn't pay for the meal - despite it being the fault of the cook!

Yummy Korean Food Restaurant,"This place is definitely a good place to go for cheap Korean food. Its not the greatest, but for the convenience and price, food was pretty good. I ordered the tangsooyook and my husband ordered the nengmyun. The tangsooyook was ok in terms of flavour and meat to batter ratio. This dish is usually made with pork or beef, but here they make it with chicken. This is the first time I've had it with chicken and I wasn't a fan. A couple pieces were still a little raw inside and the flavour is just not the same. It tastes best with pork. Also, the batter was a little too soft for me. My husband's nengmyun which is the cold noodle was pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but just good.

The pancake was good but slightly too thin for my liking and was mostly kimchi and not very generous in seafood. The ramyun rice cake was 90% ramyun, and the rice cakes were in the sliced form instead of the tubes (is this how it is normally?). The sauce was also a bit too sweet for my liking. My plate of squid and beef was a bit too oily for my liking but tasted pretty good. It is worth mentioning that portions were HUGE and side dishes were a plenty.

My friends bibimbap was good according to her, and with all the little sides that come with it (e.g. potatos, kimchi, glass noodles) I find it's very worth the price.

I realize that the location and the restaurant's decor is likely why the prices are a bit inflated in comparison to any other Asian restaurant; so maybe come here if you're trying to impress someone.

The bao are very soft and lightly toasted. The bulgogi beef was delicious - I thought this was one of their best dishes, however I do think that #13 is pretty costly for 3 small sliders.2) Deep Fried Dumplings ($6)This was an average plate of fried dumplings. For a total of 6 dumplings, I thought this was VERY overpriced, I can purchase 2 packs of these dumplings from the grocery store and make these myself. The sauce added to the ""asian fusion"", but it wasn't exactly asian fusion in my opinion.3) Kimchi Ravioli ($9)There were four pieces of approximately 5cm by 6cm ravioli pieces. These ravioli pieces are gently breaded before being toasted. I thought this was a really interesting asian fusion dish, but the flavours didn't blend so well together for me.

The fried chicken was pretty good and tasted like popcorn chicken you order at Destiny's or other bubble tea joints. The egg waffle didn't have much egg-y flavor. I was very disappointed with the green tea egg waffle. It had a light flavor of matcha but that was very overpowered with the honey that was drizzled all over the waffle. It made it way too sweet and I only had a couple bites before I gave up on it. It also came with 2 tiny breakfast sausages and over easy eggs. Definitely not worth $14...maybe $7-8 max.

While our server was beyond amazing making sure we were well taken care of, the food was a bit lacking. The mac and cheese bulgogi was a little bland and not enough cheese so I felt like I was eating cooked noodles with seasoned beef. We ordered the poutine with a sunny side egg and it was enjoyable, but the fries it self was soggy and I just didn't find it special. The bulgogi sliders were the best part and if I find myself at Te again then I would definitely order it! The fried chicken was fried chicken, nothing special and nothing bad about it.

They apparently bake their own buns and the sliders  are topped with fried quail eggs and wasabi mayo.

Té,"Can't go wrong here. Glad I checked this place out!Came for afternoon drinks and snacks. Impressed with the value and quality of the food. Ordered the taiwanese chicken and unadultered bulgogi ssam. Very authentic taste!The ambiance was casual and laidback. It's a cute and modern establishment to hang out with your friends or go on a date- bonus if you get the booth right at the front!Service was good, the server was knowledgeable about the menu and recommended his top picks.

Té,"We stumbled upon this place randomly for dinner, it was a modern, hip asian fusion restaurant with loud music / atmosphere that serves alcohols and a ton of tapas that you can share with your homies. The service was pretty good, food came out really fast and our server was very patient in explaining their most popular dishes and what the restaurant was all about. All in all, it was an enjoyable experience and I would come back!We had the bulgogi sliders, deep fried dumplings and the toasted kimchi ravioli. The bulgogi sliders and kimchi ravioli were pretty good! Their whole menu has some really cool asian fusion items!",4.0,4.0,55,2017-09-10,43.64576,-79.419686,"Asian Fusion , Taiwanese , Korean"
Té,"This is my second time coming to Té and today I came with my husband and 2 kids (2 yr old and 5 month old). Yes we are that couple that inappropriately brings our kids to restaurants that we don't belong in because they're too hipster or upscale, but we desperately needed a date night! We were originally going to Odd Seoul but had to wait a while for a table so we strolled a few doors down to Té. Despite 2 young kids in tow, we were welcomed right in and seated immediately.Food: awesome, incredibly tasty and well priced. Our favourite was the bulgogi sliders- the meat was flavorful, quail egg was perfectly cooked, the wasabi mayo added a nice kick, and the house made buns were delectable with a hint of sweetness to it. Overall great balance of flavours. The Taiwanese fried chicken was also tasty- great spices, well seasoned and the skin was light and crispy. Service: impeccable, and the biggest reason I gave 5 stars. We were lucky to have Steven as our waiter as he welcomed us and our kids with open arms and never made us feel rushed. He was attentive, friendly, and went out of his way to make us feel comfortable, always making sure the kids had everything they needed. It wasn't busy tonight (Wednesday evening) so we got to chat a bit with him every time he came around which was really nice. Ambience: cool vibe, with a TV playing Sailormoon on one wall and a funky mural on the other wall. Music was great (old school tracks from my high school days!) and at a perfect volume to have a normal conversation. Overall had a perfect and wonderful evening at Té and hope to come back soon to try their weekend brunch!

Té,"I will start off by saying that in terms of the physical layout, location and waiter service I was more then pleased with those aspects when it came to Té. However (and it's the most important in my books!), I honestly think the price you pay for the portion sizes one receives is beyond ridiculously small and overpriced for this restaurant. I ended up ordering the poutine dish on the menu, and for what $10 bought me I have to say it was the smallest and least tastiest poutine I have ever eaten. That was a big disappoint in my opinion because it's not a hard dish to screw up in reality. My suggestions are either drop the dish or start making your portions larger in all seriousness. There were other food items my other friends ordered and we all agreed there were some items lacking (like why wouldn't you naturally serve a side with fried chicken?). I personally would never come back here as I feel like my money can be well better spent somewhere else...",4.0,2.0,55,2017-07-17,43.64576,-79.419686,"Asian Fusion , Taiwanese , Korean"

Té,Cute restaurant in ossington which serves Asian fusion food.  Food was okay nothing too special.  Service is nice but a little slow.,4.0,3.0,55,2017-07-16,43.64576,-79.419686,"Asian Fusion , Taiwanese , Korean"
Té,"When I looked at the menu, I was overwhelmed (in a good way) with all of the unique fusion food items! There was a gigantic list of various tapa-style dishes -- so that you could order a lot to share with one or more people -- and also a main course list that also contained food items that were just as unique as the tapa ones. I felt like I couldn't choose just a few but instead wanted to order and eat the entire menu! LOL. I was really impressed with the selection and variety (and creativity) of the dishes!We settled on several tapas to share, one main course, and their unique tea-inspired cocktails of course. The server was extremely accommodating, friendly, attentive, and catered to us the entire night. We felt the warm hospitality and greatly appreciated it!For my tea-inspired cocktail, I ordered the Mango Black Té which our server commented that it was one of the top picks as it contained the mini tapioca pearls. It also contained scotch whiskey, assam tea, mango syrup, teapot bitters, and dried mango.It was definitely a unique drink that tasted of alcohol and tea! There was the slight mango taste and I really liked the mini tapioca pearls. They were so tiny but chewy and bouncy. What I appreciated the most about this cocktail was that it wasn't watered down at all and it was rich in flavour -- something that I find a lot of cocktails lack and thus why I don't always order drinks during dinner.Before long, our food arrived! The first to arrive was the Salsa Set. This had two small bowls of fresh kimchi-spiked tomato salsa and guacamole with tortilla chips. The guacamole was substantial and contained ample mashed avocado in it. The kimchi-spiked tomato salsa was what made the Salsa Set so unique. It was very tasty!However, there were so many more tasty things to come. The next one was the Kimchi Deviled Eggs. These, in addition to the Salsa Set, were recommended to us. The Kimchi Deviled Eggs were hard-boiled eggs redressed in a kimchi paste, sesame and yolk mash, and topped with finely chopped bacon. Even just reading that description made my foodie senses tingle. I've never heard of deviled eggs served this way! And what do you know, these were delicious! The hard-boiled eggs were done just right; smooth and tender. The kimchi paste wasn't very strong in spiciness and I loved the finely chopped bacon on the top which gave it a very crunchy texture. I loved this tapa!The Toasted Kimchi Ravioli was a bonus from the kitchen from Grace to us to try. These were panko crusted jumbo ravioli squares filled with a kimchi-spiked ricotta, mozzarella and parmesan blend, and finished with a drizzle of honeyed wasabi pesto sauce. These were very unique and I thought that they tasted more of the ricotta and mozzarella cheese than kimchi. However, reading its description again, it doesn't really say there is kimchi actually inside the ravioli squares. It is simply kimchi-spiked! These were still quite good though. (Eat them while they are hot so it retains its shape before deflating.)The Braised Pork Crostini was a surprise favourite for the both of us. It contained chopped Taiwanese slow-cooked pork belly on toasted French baguette slices. There were four of these on the platter and it was best to eat it when it was served. The slow-cooked pork belly was so well seasoned and tender that it tasted like eating pate to me at one point -- I loved it. It was perfect and I didn't know that braised pork on crostini would taste so good!The Bulgogi Sliders came in four as well. These were thin slices of soy-marinated beef sirloin piled high on toasted mini sesame buns, each topped with a runny quail egg and wasabi mayo. These were adorable to eat and served open-faced. This left the preference to put in some spicy Korean sauce if you so desired (as I did later on using sauce from the Pizza Tteokbokki). I actually didn't taste the wasabi mayo in these sliders very much, and I found the sliders a little bland. However, upon adding some sauce to complement the beef, it was quite good!The Pizza Tteokbokki was served in a black pan and contained soft, Asian-style steamed rice dough balls sauteed with garlic, onion, and bell peppers smothered in a sweet chili tomato sauce and oven-baked with mozzarella. This was incredible and tasted like authentic Korean ttoekbokki! The rice dough balls were perfectly tender and chewy; not hard at all which is difficult to achieve sometimes. The mozzarella was incredibly cheesy and perfect with this Korean style ""pizza""! (I used the sauce from this pizza on the Bulgogi Sliders and it really enhanced the taste.) I absolutely love fried chicken, especially popcorn chicken or Japanese or Taiwanese fried chicken. Thus, when I saw that they had Dark Spiced Taiwanese Chicken, I absolutely had to try it. It comes in a two-piece or four-piece order. For us, since we were trying so many other tapas, the two-piece order was perfect. There was a thigh and a leg part that were served and",4.0,5.0,55,2016-11-03,43.64576,-79.419686,"Asian Fusion , Taiwanese , Korean"

Trattoria Taverniti,"If you are familiar with South Italian cooking you may think this place is great. There are some very positive reviews and thats what brought me here. First interaction was awesome; friendly waitress/hostess, nice cozy booth for 2, immediate menus and water service, nice. The waitress was the highlight of our dinner. I didn't get her name but she was the only one there, next to Nonna who was floating around the bar, serving customers Like my daughter said, ""you know a place is authentic when there's a Nonna behind the bar"". And authentic South Italian it is. The menu is full of comfort foods: pasta, pizza, and many things with red sauce. But there lies the first problem. The tomato sauce was very salty. Unfortunately I ordered the aranchini and polpette (rice balls and meatballs) and both dishes were heavily laden with sauce. Somewhat tasty but too salty. The seafood pasta noodles were cooked perfectly al dente but then slathered with the same salty red sauce. I read the pizzas were awesome and I would loved to have tried it. Maybe next time, although I'm not sure that will happen. There are so many great Italian places along College that I can think of several that I prefer. The interior is very small and the problem with that occurs when there's a couple of loud guys at the bar drinking and laughing it up with Nonna.

Food came out in a decent time.Food 2/5:For appetizer we had the guacamole and chips. The guacamole was okay. I prefer my avocado more chunky, but I did like the chips that came with it.We got a variety of different tacos: We ordered the shrimp, beef, and baha fish taco. The best by far was the baha fish taco. The piece of fish was cooked perfectly and the batter was nice and thin. I felt like the shrimp and beef taco was missing a bit of coleslaw or something that would make it stand out more. We also ordered the pulled pork quesadilla - which was my least favourite thing of the night. The pulled pork was salty and the cheese made the whole thing overly salty. I woudn't recommend ordering this. Stick to the tacos.The place has quite a number of seats and since we came on a weekday there were quite a few tables.

MEXITACO,"I really love Mexican food, so I had high hopes that this place would live up to the reputation. Plus I was really exited when I saw actual Mexican people working there. This must be authentic I thought. We collectively ordered many of the traditional items, tacos (of course), quezadilla, pico de gallo, horchata drink, hibiscus drink, and nachos. The tacos were disappointing, the meat was so dry, there was hardly any salsa on then or garnish. The quesadilla was small - nothing wrong with that - but it was so bland, no spices, no flavour. The food was missing the Mexican spice and taste I know and love, it was almost like the cooks were blind or had run out of all the ingredients and were serving food with barely nothing on it. I mentioned our bad experience to the server whom in turn mentioned it to the cook, who says that is how he does it!

MEXITACO,"After hearing great reviews about this restaurant, I decided to give it a try since I was in the neighbourhood.First thing to note would be that the parking situation is not ideal. There is no parking lot and you have to either park on a residential street and walk 5 minutes to the restaurant or park at the No Frills or McDonald's across the street and risk getting towed or ticketed.We visited on a Thursday night and the restaurant had a few tables occupied. We were given a menu and water promptly.After looking over the menu, we settled on a Tostada and 5 different tacos. Before the food arrived, the server came with two hot sauces and fresh lime to squeeze on the tacos. Both of the hot sauces were not very hot and it was hard to distinguish them from each other besides the colour.Shrimp Ceviche Tostada ($5.99)Fresh shrimp tossed in a citrus marinade with pico de gallo and two tiny slivers of avocado served on a crispy fried corn tortilla. This dish was quite bland and you could tell that it wasn't cured or marinaded long enough and was quickly tossed prior to serving, thus lacking flavour to be a real ceviche.Carne Asada Tacos (2 for $6.49)Marinade grilled beef, diced onion and cilantro. The beef was moist but lacked flavour, it seemed like it wasn't marinated but rather quickly seasoned.Chorizo Tacos (2 for $6.49)Chopped spicy sausage, diced onion and cilantro. These were the best tacos of the night as the chorizo were very flavourful and moist.Al Pastor Tacos (2 for $6.49)Adobo marinated grilled pork, grilled pineapple, diced onion and cilantro. Pork was bland and the pineapple didn't taste grilled and looked like it came straight from a can.After eating these 3 tacos, we quickly realized that they weren't easily distinguishable from each other as they all were drowned with the diced onion and cilantro. It would have been nice if they each had different garnishes and more flavour in the meat.We thought we'd give them another shot so we tried the Baja Tacos.Baja Fish Taco (1 for $5.49)Large piece of beer battered fish, pico de gallo, chipotle mayo and cilantro. These were quite tasty but the fish was not very crispy and it looked like the oil was a bit old as the batter on the fish was quite dark.Baja Calamari Taco (1 for $5.49)3 pieces of beer battered calamari, pico de gallo, chipotle mayo and cilantro. The calamari looked and tasted it came from frozen and were not home made. The batter fell off after biting a piece of calamari and tasted stale.Overall, the different tacos all tasted very similar to each other as the garnishes were all the same. This place would get a better review if different garnishes were used, the meats were marinated or seasoned more and the oil was fresher. One positive was that the food is quite cheap as the entire bill with tax came to about $40.",4.0,3.0,49,2018-01-20,43.708814,-79.295977,"Mexican , Cocktail Bars , Latin American"

MEXITACO,"It's hard to find good quality Mexican food in Toronto.  It's even harder to find a place that isn't downtown.  Well thankfully a good friend mentioned this place had moved and was now in the east end.  Blink and you might miss it but it's on the corner of Victoria Park and St Clair (right across the No Frills).  It's small inside but they pack in a lot of tables.  Went on a Friday night and the place was jumping jumping.  As the night wore on it just got busier (apparently around 8-9pm there is a show Friday nights).  We were finished eating by that time and stayed a bit to see if started but we ended up leaving as we didn't want to hog the table when others needed it.I wasn't super hungry so I ordered the beer battered shrimp tacos and the baha fish tacos (you get 2 of each).  They were delicious.  No greasy, not bland, just delicious.  The owners/staff are from what I have heard are Mexican.  So they know what they are cooking.  The atmosphere is lively, the service is friendly and the food is GREAT.  I will definitely add this as one of my regular rotations of deliciousness",4.0,4.0,49,2017-08-18,43.708814,-79.295977,"Mexican , Cocktail Bars , Latin American"
MEXITACO,"My coworkers and I came here for lunch on Friday and it was empty when we got there(12:30 ish). The servers are very nice and helpful, and importantly they were fast.However, I think the food was very overpriced.. two tacos are $5.99. And that's if you don't add any cheese or guacamole each for $1.99 EACH (what taco doesn't come with cheese already?...) I got the carne asada burrito with cheese (again $1.99 for that cheese). I was disappointed with what I got. It tastes worse than Burrito Boyz burritos.I did try my coworkers quesadilla, which was pretty good.

They give you two tortillas with this one because the fish is too big for the one. Other things I ordered and enjoyed:Shrimp Ceviche TostatasChorizo tacosEl Pastor tacosPrices are REALLY good. You get small tacos, but since the price is good, you can order a bunch and feel full.The service is fast, friendly, and attentive. They were great at splitting the bill with a huge group of people, and were organized. The restaurant is clean, but has that authentic divey feel that you want when you go to Mexican bar.

As for the restaurant's appearance, at first glance from the outside, it looks unfinished and a bit cheap (sorry), but upon entering you're pleasantly surprised with a rustic atmosphere with Mexican themed decor everywhere. Even their light fixtures were so unique and I just loved everything about this place. To order I got the camarones al pastor (I think that's what it's called) and my friend got the ground beef nachos which we both enjoyed. I'd have to say, however, the absolute best part of my meal was the churros for dessert! These were honestly the best churros I've ever tasted and I love that they're made fresh in-house everyday.

MEXITACO,"Sorry for your loss Bloorcourt Village but Mexitaco now belongs to us East Yorkers and Scarberians *evil laugh* Hubby and I caught them during their soft opening; so they're still finishing their decor and feeling out the neighborhood. I really appreciate that their platters are two tacos each which was more budget friendly for us while giving us more flexibility in ordering other menu items. Our favorites were the fish cerviche tostada (fresh and flavorful), tinga (deliciously smoky and spicy) and deep fried ice cream (delightful flavors and textures). Tortillas are not made in house but are made fresh and delivered daily.The owners and cooks are all from Mexico City. Family run: dad is head chef, mom is hostess and waits tables, and their son is the bartender. If you want to know anything about Mexican culture ask the cool bartender, Alex, who also happens to be a fellow Yelper! We had an engaging talk about the biopic Selena (played brilliantly by Jennifer Lopez), Lucha Libre wrestling, the origins of chocolate and vanilla, all the while listening to lively Cumbia music.This is the closest you'll ever get to the authentic flavors and feel of Mexico City in Toronto my friends.

Please note I only say that due to how some of my friends reacted when I suggested this restaurant and they thought some of the patrons inside looked questionable - however, after reassuring that everything would be fine, it actually was, and turned out way better and more than what I had originally expected.So I popped by on a Sunday with no line ups or deafening crowds and the service was on point, attentive and very friendly. My friends and I ordered some baja fish tacos; shrimp ceviche; tacos de carne asada; tacos de tinga; and started off with some guacamole nachos that were delicious! My friends planned a surprise for me by giving the staff my cake ahead of time and it went off without a hitch to which I was definitely shocked, appreciative and happy, all the while unbeknownst to me! I also ordered a dessert thing of churros that came with 2 dipping sauces. Both were pretty tasty.After that, everything was pretty smooth sailing and I ended up giving them some of my cake to try.

MEXITACO,"Mmmmm. It's surprisingly hard to find decent Mexican food in the East end. While downtown is spoiled with Mexican goodness, the East end is mostly filled with duds and canned refried beans. Mexitaco is not one of those places. Not only is the whole interior done by the owners, the furniture is also homemade from what I hear. I learned that they used to have a Bloor and ossington location for over 16 years, which makes sense; their recipes are great. We ordered a bean and cheese tostada, a chicken things tostada. 2 carne asada tacos, and 2 chicken things tacos. Surprisingly, the chicken things tostada and taco were able to differentiate themselves. They had that same tinga flavor but we're still distinct from one another. The carne asada tacos were my favorite item. Meat was perfectly tender and seasoned. Mmm. Extra quac and cheese on tacos is 1.99 each, so a little pricey. I don't think they need the extra ingredients though, which is a sign of a good quality taco.

Having recently coming back from LA and having mexican food that was out of this world. I was quite excited about coming here.

Lots of sauce, not dry at all. That being said, the chips did not get soggy and turn into mush. Solid nachos. The habanero sauce was delicious as well. I'm not a spicy person and I handled it just fine.Tacos - come in 2. each taco is like a 2 bite taco. you're gonna have to order a few of these.Carne asada - marinated grilled beef, diced onion, cilantro. Beef is cooked all the way through, nicely seasoned, but would have preferred the beef to be cooked to a medium so it was a bit more juicy.Al Pastor - marainated grilled pork, grilled pineapple, diced onion. same thing, lacked a bit of juice, but overall flavourful. pineapple is a nice touch. maybe add cheese for the extra $2?Pescado asado - marinated grilled fish, pico de gallo, cilantro. one word. excellentCamarones al pastor - marinated grilled shrimp, grilled pineapple, diced onion, cilantro. also excellent. shrimp goes along with the pineapple beautifully.Burrito de tingaagain that's chipotle chicken. The burritos are good sized for a meal. Not filled with just rice and has a good portion of chicken and beans.Quesadilla de picadilloground beef in tomato stew, cheese. this is also great for sharing. quesdillas are never enough for a meal in my opinion. the cheese was nice and stringy. delicious.Churrosthese are made fresh. super crispy on the exterior with a nice soft center. the caramel sauce is amazing. also made in house. i could die for these.Fried Ice creamchoice of vanilla or chocolate. we went with vanilla. also has pecans.

Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu,"I saw this restaurant featured in an episode of Kim's Convenience (season 1) and ever since then, I've wanted to try it. I ordered the most popular dish combination soon tofu and dolsotbab with beef, shrimp, and mussel. The stew came with a few slices of pork, one mussel, one unpeeled shrimp, and an ABUNDANCE of tofu. It also came with a hot stone pot of purple rice which was scooped into our bowls by the server. The server then poured water into the hot stone pot and left it soaking on our tables. I was unsure if there was a purpose or they wanted to grab all the dirty dishes together. Puzzled, we ate with soaking wet rice on our side.The stew was okay, the soup wasn't too rich in flavour. Maybe it was because I didn't ask for it too spicy. It also came with an egg on the side you crack yourself into the stew which is pretty cool. I love rich stew and the soon tofu wasn't the greatest for me. I hope their other dishes have promise and I believe they do based on the number of customers.

The bibimbap in its hot stone bowl was majorly filling and fresh. So many veggies on top, that cooked as the meal progressed. But the egg on top- it's like they cook multiple eggs on the same sheet pan and then cut them away from each other, leaving weird straight but slanted lines around each yolk. The soup on the other hand - beef dumping and tofu variety - was an even bigger exploration. A raw egg was dropped off at the table and cracked into the soup, cooking it to the desired doneness. It also came with some just-steamed purple rice. The soup opened up a new, glutenous dimension to the rice. Comfort food at it's best! And witnessing the pot bubbling away is pure magic.

Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu,"Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu is one of my favourite restaurants in Koreatown. The menu is simple and straightforward. There's only nine items on the menu, but all of the items are done well. Moreover, the prices are very reasonable. One of my favourite is the combination soon tofu ($9.74) which comes with beef, shrimp and mussels. The silky tofu in the spicy broth really hits the spot. It's Korean comfort food at its finest. The soon tofu comes with a side of dolsotbab (purple multigrain rice in a stone bowl) which allows you to mix the soon tofu stew in with the rice. The soon tofu taste great with the rice.My other favourite is the dolsot bimbimbap ($12.39). It comes in a stone bowl. It is a nice mix of veggies and a fried egg cover the bed of rice.The atmosphere of the restaurant is not fancy. You do not come here for great service or atmosphere.

Nove Trattoria,I had lunch today at Nove Trattoria with work colleagues.I ordered Pollo alla parmigiana.  I love chicken parm and this was delicious.  There was a light coating on the chicken and the chicken was really tender.  The tomato sauce was tasty.  The spaghetti was tossed in a garlic oil and was good.  It was a nice contrast to the tomato sauce and cheese.I also had chocolate raspberry tartufo which was yummy.

Nove Trattoria,"Expectations were built up as our friends told us this is a hidden gem and one of the best Italian meals in the city. However, I found it only satisfactory. The food:We ordered an array of pastas and risottos. The Fettucine Della Nonna was the best dish on the table with a cream based sauce with al dente fettuccini pasta (just the way I like it), sautéed spinach, mushrooms and chicken. The chicken was rotisserie and was fairly tough and dry. I like my chicken tender and juicy, this was not it. They need to fix the chicken and this dish would be on point. The risotto was lacking. I ordered a mushroom risotto and found it was over cooked, it didn't have that bite that a properly cooked risotto needs. Nove can take this dish to the best level with the addition of some truffle oil and rosemary. The Service:The service was below average as the waiter wasn't so happy to see a group with kids. At least pretend you're happy to serve us. The waiter didn't stop by and ask if we're enjoying our food. The owner did when we was bussing the other table.

You can tell the people there are legit Italian and are super super friendly. Bread is served ""Italian-style"" with olive oil and vinegar rather than butter. For my lunch, I ordered penne de golosone (penne in a rose sauce with smoked salmon, black olives and asparagus) and thought it was pretty good, although the salmon was just a tad on the salty side. I'm usually not a huge fan of olives, but I thought they complimented the dish well.

The Ace,"If you're looking for an inviting, low key, and relaxed diner with personality, this would be your place for brunch.  We arrived fairly early on a Sunday morning (just before 10 am) and snagged a free table that just finished.  Though its no where as crazy as Lady Marmalade for line up but there was a steady stream where of families to keep a waiting list going.This closely reminds me of Lady Marmalade except Ace a bit more hip, chill, and considerably less little kids running about.  We maybe had 1 table here with a child ... whereas Lady Marmalade was a near zoo with much food tossing and little feet pittering and pattering.  Ace does not have a lot of tables... mostly tables of 3 people.  You could push 4 into an area if you know each other really well.  It's not well lit so for those who are avid food picture takes (ahem me...) it really pushes your photo editing skills to the limit.  Service here is really friendly ... they have this great relaxed vibe that you feel you could just open with a funny story of your day and they'll love it.  There are definite regulars here and you can see in the way they interact in the staff that it's their perfect spot.  Almost like old friends.The menu here is not very big but its fairly well curated.  We came for the French Toast so that was not negotiable and I got their daily omelette (kale & brie) with a good cup of coffee & the Pluck Muskoka Chai tea.  Before I get into the food, this place does tea and coffee pretty good... you don't get coloured water but actually enough tea leaves and spices to make a good cup.Blueberry caramelized banana french toast - Soft challah bread that are soaked in custard and grilled up nicely but leaving the interior quite eggy soft.  The caramelized bananas add a wonderful flavour and the blueberries give it a nice sweet tart berry note to it.  Though this didnt come with syrup or much powdered sugar, I think it hit the right sweet notes.  4.5/5Kale Brie omelette - it came with a generous portion of breakfast potatoes (really fries but in chunks).  The addition of the hot sauce made it a hearty meal as the omelette was a fair portion.  I did feel there was not much brie at all in there but I was happy with seeing some greens peak through.  I liked how the omelette wasn't overcooked or rubbery.  4/5Definitely come here for the relaxed easy Sunday brunches and indulge in a very good french toast.  I would say it's definitely in the top 5 and with the prices fairly reasonable and the wait not too bad, this is a good decent spot to keep on your regular brunch rotation.",4.0,4.0,142,2017-10-06,43.646144,-79.44881,"Comfort Food , Breakfast & Brunch , Canadian (New)"

I came for a lunch yesterday with a friend and when I stepped foot in the restaurant, it really reminded of the Senator near Yonge Dundas square. It has a antique, vintage, old school style feel, really quite something. Very narrow place too you'll know what I mean once you guys eat there. I ordered the carne asada tacos (comes in 3), and the veggie (portobello) burger with a side of fries. My friend and I split everything so I got to try both dishes. You know what happened? I kept saying ""mmm"" every time I bit into the burger, the fries and--you know what everything on the table! The food was so godlike I kept muttering ""mmm"" probably 20x if I can estimate.The burger's sauce.... I think it's blue cheese paste? It was so strong but it worked so well in the combination. Now the fries. WOW. Texture-wise, it was perfect. I mean...the perfect fries. Perfect amount of salt, crispy-ness/crunch. I loved them. Now the tacos were pretty awesome too. It was a flavor party in my mouth, with guac, perfectly cooked beef...etc etc. Just fantastic.I am actually checking out their brunch fairly soon since most of the reviews talk about that menu.

The Ace,"Went for dinner here a week ago with high expectations as we'd previously gone to the Ace for brunch and were very satisfied with our meals.I decided to try the AAA brisket burger and my girlfriend ordered the fried chicken and cornbread. Before we got our mains we started with the deep fried Ontario Brussel sprouts-these paired with the lemon aioli were delicious and you're given sizeable portion that's easily enough for a couple to share. Unfortunately this was the lone bright spot of our meal. My brisket burger, while cooked to medium as I requested was over salted by whoever was working the grill that night. When I bit into it all I could taste was salt, which overpowered the meat and condiments (which were very limited and barely noticeable). If we weren't sitting next to the kitchen I would've sent it back. Correction - I should've sent it back. My girlfriends fried chicken also missed the mark. It was tough and chewy and not all that flavourful. You would think the chef would nail something simple like fried chicken but you could tell it had been under-seasoned and likely not been brined or left in buttermilk overnight to be moistened. The cornbread and collard greens were decent but I think this dish would've been better paired with a mashed potato. Overall thoughts: We definitely left dinner unimpressed but maybe we came into it with our expectations set too high after doing brunch a few months earlier. We'll likely return for brunch at the Ace but with other options available on Ronce, Queen St W and the Junction at a similar price point I don't think we'll be back for dinner.

Pattaya Thai Kitchen,"It isn't often that I make it out to the Beaches area these days, but when I do, obligatory eating transpires. On a late Saturday afternoon, we waited for about five minutes before our party of two was seated in this small (but not tiny) Queen Street restaurant. Having just bought some Holy Basil for my herb garden, I immediately felt the need to order the Holy Basil lunch dish, with chicken. Obviously I need to set a baseline for my future cookery. As an accompaniment, a tall glass of thai iced tea.After a quick trip downstairs to the washroom to give my hands a wash, a spring roll appear in front of me. I didn't order a spring roll... wtf? But it turns out that it comes with one! Woah. It was good. Hot, crispy, savoury, and most importantly, not greasy. An amazing spring roll experience.After setting the bar so high, the thai iced tea arrive and this too did not disappoint. Once I gave it a good swirl to bring it to its final deep red-brown hue (and also to mix in the dairy), I took a long blissful sip. The rich, bold flavour brought back childhood memories of running through fields of grass along the country side, devoid of all cares in the world. Actually, it didn't. But it was delicious, and the flavour *was* rich and bold with strong black tea undertones, mellowed by a gentle sweetness.Next came the ... Holy Basil? Wait. Where's the basil? After digging around a bit, I found a few pieces here and there, but it wasn't as basily as I would have expected. In fact, it wasn't basily at all. Instead, it was salty, like someone added too much soy sauce and not enough of anything else. But that said, I didn't not finish it, although towards the end when the rice supply was running thin, it was getting difficult.So would I come back? Probably. Would I order the same main?

Pattaya Thai Kitchen,"For now I'm rating it as three because I've only tried one dish (take out) and hope some others will be better. I ordered the Red Curry with veggies & tofu and substituted the jasmine rice with coconut rice for an extra $2. From the reviews I expected a phenomenally seasoned, exceptional quality meal. Sadly, I found both the curry and rice on the bland side needing much more seasoning and intensity. The coconut rice was the mildest I've ever tasted. Pros of the dish were an abundance of fresh vegetables with lots of variety. There wasn't as much tofu as other restaurants but I wasn't bothered by the overall quantity.  I also had a mango salad which wasn't anything extraordinary, it was as expected although I did enjoy the addition of mint and cilantro. I'm willing to try a few other dishes before making a final verdict but overall I was a disappointed based on the reviews.",4.0,3.0,52,2017-06-20,43.673754,-79.282738,Thai

Service was good, though mind you it was quite empty when I went, and we were served shrimp chips as a starter which is always a plus (I really really like shrimp chips). Food-wise I would say it was quite standard Thai food  - good, but quite standard nonetheless - nothing to write home about.

Pattaya Thai Kitchen,"Great food, Beautiful ambiance and Friendly staff - Now that's a recipe for a fantastic restaurant, and that's exactly what you should expect as you walk in the doors of Pattaya. It's so hard to find authentic Thai cuisine without trekking downtown, but no more, Pattaya has filled the gap. As we walked in we were greeted by friendly staff and we requested to be seated by the window (with beautifully draped curtains - perfect for a date night) and they accommodated with no hesitation. The interior was simple but elegant, and they pay a lot of attention to details (there were designated glass place holders on each table!!). Note worthy moment: We asked one of the staff to take a picture of us, as we were celebrating a b'day and he did. But he went a step further by asking if it's ok if he took a picture from outside the restaurant of both of us since we were seated by the window. Now that's customer service - Going over and beyond to satisfy customers!!! Two thumbs up! :)With regards to food I'm going to give Pattaya 5 full stars! It's up to par with the Thai holy grails downtown. The squash fritters were so crispy and fresh with a delicious sauce, and the presentation was beautiful. For mains we ordered Holy Basil Chicken and Curry Pad Thai w/ Chicken and they were both perfection! I really wanted their Mango Sticky rice for dessert but we were stuffed by then. But I shall be back, so no worries! :)All in all, Pattaya is definitely worth the trek to the East end if you're not from this end of the town. It is rather small for a restaurant, but they have optimized the space to seat as many as possible comfortably. Do give it a try!!",4.0,5.0,52,2016-06-12,43.673754,-79.282738,Thai

The menu was smaller than I was use to but they had lots of dishes that would work for everyone even if you were a picky eater or it was your fist time having Thai Food.

Pattaya Thai Kitchen,"First off, the food is really good. But I'm giving them just the one star because they do the worst practice in the restaurant industry - upcharging you on substitutes (ex: beef for chicken) without informing you. We were a party of six, three of which three did substitutes. We only found out at the final bill. The menu clearly says ""choice of"" but, in fine print elsewhere on the menu, there is a substitute charge. What made this whole thing worse is that management even acknowledged this, but still didn't change our bill. Terrible customer service considering we've been there many time. Could have retained a customer with a simple act, but their poor handling of this issue have lost them a customer for good.",4.0,1.0,52,2017-05-27,43.673754,-79.282738,Thai
Eastside Social,"This is a casual, relaxed place that is nice for dates and catching up with old friends. Definitely a great spot for seafood. The service was good. Our waiter was bubbly, energetic and provided honest recommendations. The restaurant was fairly busy so the service was not as fast but there was only 1 waiter at the time so it's understandable. We went there in the summertime so ate on the patio. It's a small establishment with an intimate feel. The food took a long time to come out but there were only one or two chefs at the back so we weren't surprised. The menu and cuisine is simple but still effective. You get decent portions for your money and quality ingredients. Don't expect huge portions of food..this isn't your local ""boys night out sports bar pub n grub"" okay ;). Would not recommend this restaurant/bar for big groups. The decor/ambience is minimalistic and just as simple as their menu but still aesthetically pleasing. If you're the foodie photo taker type you'll definitely be able to snap some nice shots. Personally, I find this simple classic style to be a bit elegant and romantic. Yup I dig it!

The octopus was tender and charred just right to bring out the flavors. With that said, the dish was too salty and heavy because of that puddle of olive oil. I love garlic and I thought this was a bit too much for me as well, and it was incredibly spicy because of the red chilies! -Salmon Tartare - $17The salmon was buttery light and fresh, I liked how the soy & lime vinaigrette wasn't too overpowering and complimented the fish perfectly.

Eastside Social,"We were able to get a reservation for Saturday night at 18:30 thanks to someone cancelling and it sure was worth it. The decor is an eclectic mix of post war and edgy, almost industrial. We loved that.The menu is uncluttered. I never like places which try and be ""all things to all people"", so figure on a resto-bar which serves up amazing seafood dishes to tapas sized appies. I always gauge my reviews on several things as I mentioned earlier - the food (of course); the menu; the wait staff and the decor. It is not often that you can find a place which gets it right on all of my criteria and this place sure does.Everyone has previously reviewed the fish tacos and the octopus, so I order the fish tacos. OUTSTANDING dish. An interesting and delicate dish with complex flavors which are layered between the apple slaw and aioli. It was not the usual oily battered fish, thrown into a taco with whatever was available, but a truly thought out creation making it a local favorite.Bonnie (wifus-maximus), had the muscles and, again, a delight for the senses.The one thing which stands out at Eastside Social, is how everyone working there, seems to want to be there. They are totally engaged into your experience without hovering over you. I alway like to meet the owner and Sherry was just a wonderful person. When I told her how much I enjoyed the fish-tacos, she playfully responded that ""they are so popular, that they help pay the rent"".Honestly, the only disappointment (if you want to call it that), was that we could not order the Lobster-Bacon Croquettes as they had sold out. Come on! I mean Lobster-Bacon Croquettes! How yummy does that sound? We were not surprised and need to make sure that we ask them to put some aside for us next time. The mere sound of that combo, had all the mouths of our party of six, watering.Delivery was very reasonable from ordering to arrival at the table. Our friends ordered the Fish Cakes and we all had the plum tart with coffee for desert.What I really want to leave as an impression, is about the balance of flavor. So many restaurants mask bad food with a lot of spices, whereby you cannot actually detect the fish or the fruit you are ingesting. This place takes an inordinate attention to the detail of the flavor. Everything seems to be designed around bring that out. From your appy or entre to your desert, there always seems to be a sense of balance where when you bight into it, you want to take a moment to let all your senses kick into the different layers of flavors.Our man Martin was terrific. A point I always make is to ask our waiter's name. I hate the ""hey you"" approach many people have and when they are great, I make a point of letting the manager know this. Martin and the entire team function as a aunt and helped each other out, another sign of a great restaurant.Sherry, we are DEFINITELY coming back and hoping the Lobster-Bacon Croquettes will be on the menu again :-)",4.0,4.0,52,2016-11-21,43.661387,-79.339187,Seafood

The food was fantastic and the win was amazing. The prices are steep, but that seems to be the new norm in town. The staff were very friendly, they helped us with finding this one wine that they had on their list and we fell in love with. So I kept going back there every month or so and the bartender, sadly I don't know her name but she is very lovely, remembered me to my surprise!!!So a couple of weeks ago I had some visitors from Dubai and I decided to take them there. They were shortstaffed so the owner was there helping serve people. Let me tell you he was great he was honest and upfront he told us that there was going to be delays in service because they were shortstaffed. I truly appreciate that kind of honesty. Because this sort of thing can happen to any restaurant and it's not their fault obviously, but most places would just pretend like nothings wrong and expect the patrons to put up with it. But these guys were actually honest and upfront which in turn translates into the patrons being understanding of the situation.Did I say most dishes are amazing?

Eastside Social,"My wife and I found this place online ironically and decided to check it out. It was listed in a TO blog or some sort of article. I'm glad we checked it out as it was different from many other places we've dined at.Entering East Side Social we were met by a bartender behind the bar with a smile, and the friendly hostess. Promptly we were seated. Luckily for us we got there around 6, being the 3rd table to seat. Shortly after we sat, the place was booming. A small group gathered, several couples arrived, and a father with his young daughter were noted to be on a ""date"" night. Almost all the tables were taken. The diningroom is bright enough for dinner, but soft and low enough for comfort. I'd like to be able to describe the decor but it won't do it justice. You'll have to see the pictures.Getting to the food, it was delicious. It was different. My wife had the fish tacos which were not too far off from some others she's had elsewhere in the past, but the flavours were quite rich and filling. I had the grilled octopus, and although I found it quite flavorful, it was a slightly saltier, heavier dish filled with oil. I would get it again, but my wife and I agreed that getting only one of our two dishes to share and a salad would've been a better balanced lighter meal. Especially since we had the daily bread and beer as a starter. I don't think it helped that we also had french fries with the dinner - but it was still great overall. Just beware some dishes are heavy and salty.The staff are really nice and professional. They're casual which fits into the coolness of the beaches (and my personality) but because they all wear black they easily pull off the professional style.This place is on my list of restaurants I'll be visiting again.

Le Baratin,"This place is a hidden gem! Fancy french food that delivers in quality, with a quaint little restaurant, without the fancy prices. The gentleman who serves as both host, server and bartender is also equipped with a full french accent (and I'm sure the full language capabilities). We ordered the sourdough (this was the biggest rip off with a couple of small pieces of bread), the assiette pour discuter (this was nice and came with the homemade sourdough and homemade boursin! along with other delicious things). The seafood stew that was on special was AMAZING, broth was super flavourful and there was lots of seafood. The steak frittes was delicious with yummy fries, the lamb shank was great with delicious garlic mash, and the special sardines on salad were also great! The cocktails were delicious and unique, I'd recommend trying any one! I will definitely be back when I want to go nicer without breaking the bank! Almost forgot, the desserts are delicious! Order the upside down apple pie, it will not disappoint with apples that are still crisp, a nice crust and fresh lavender whipped cream...delicious! For chocolate lovers, the chocolate mouse is very nice too!",4.0,4.0,55,2017-06-26,43.650078,-79.43514,French
Le Baratin,"My new found hidden gem... I hate to tell everyone else because I want to keep my table here but it's too good to not share!  If you love great food and so well priced without pretentious service, this is the place to be.  I came here for brunch and blown away at the flavours.  This is a place to enjoy a good coffee and a wonderful meal with friends in a rustic and warm atmosphere.The location is a bit out of the ways and the only signage is on the window but it's not too hard to find.  It is a smaller restaurant... maybe only 20 tables at most and the environment has that quaint and rustic charm.  I love how they sell their sauces in their Epicerie off to the side... they even have their own espresso blend!  You know you're in for a good meal when they even pay attention to the coffee.Service here is a touch relaxed but still personable.  Think of France where you linger over a great meal and conversation as you indulge in a great coffee on a beautiful Sunday.  There are two partners for Le Baratin and it is the chef and the front house manager.  The lovely manager was interacting with everyone and serving food.   Atlantic Farcous - So we ordered the Atlantic Farcous (a wonderful and incredibly flavourful gluten free vegetable 'pancake' with in house made salmon gravlax) with a wonderful side salad and some crispy potatoes.  5/5Croissant French Toast - We also got the BEST FRENCH TOAST... yes its needs the all caps!  they used croissants and cream to create the most wonderful custardy interior and then they sear the outside to a wonderful caramelized crisp.  Honestly, it is so decadent and I rarely use that word.  It has the best flavour and texture I've had in Toronto.  5+/5 Apple Tarte Tatin - We decided to end our brunch with the apple tarte tatin which was wonderful.  Buttery caramel enveloping the apples and soaking into the flakey buttery pastry base.  Just a wonderful! 5/5The best part of this... this is all at French Bistro prices.  You get wonderfully made food and it will not make you feel like you just spent too much.  All you will feel is a happy smile on our face from eating a delicious meal.",4.0,5.0,55,2017-05-09,43.650078,-79.43514,French

Le Baratin,"Came here with a group of 8 with a reservation on a Friday night and the place was filled. For large parties you have to pick from a prix menu, we had 3 options of an app, entree and dessert to choose from and everyone can get a different option. I started with a salad, simple but fine. For the entree I got a seafood stew and wow! it was amazing! it was a mix of fish, mussels, some clams and shrimp a good mix and portion of seafood and topped with dried slivers of green onions. The fish was a little overcooked though but the broth was amazing! it was creamy and buttery, really savory and satisfying. It was actually also very filling. For dessert I got the upside down apple tart - the apples were deeply caramelized with lots of chewy bits and extremely extremely sweet but so delicious. The pastry at the bottom was a bit chewy, but it comes really warm and the portion is huge! Plenty to split between two people if not for the prix fix. I was so full by the end I couldn't finish the tart and I had to roll myself outWith a glass of wine the total came to be about $50. However when billing it seems they have charged us more than expected and we couldn't figure out for what.

Le Baratin,"Atmosphere, lighting, music, good service and delicious food is all I ever ask for when dining out with friends. Le Baratin brought all of these aspects together and made my eating experience a very remarkable one. I went with a large group of friends before the restaurant switched over to their dinner menu. They were very patient with us and allowed us lots of time to decide what to order. It was raining heavily outside and so aside from my group of friends and 2 other people, we were alone which was great! The food was delicious! This was my first time trying french food in Toronto and it was great! I had a bite of my friends dishes and they tasted just as great as mine. I ordered the ""Baratin Ploughman"" which had many different components on the plate which satisfies how I personally like to eat. My friends ordered the ""Baked French Toast"" which was absolutely heavenly. One friend hates whipped cream however, the cream that Le Baratin presented was one that she absolutely loved. The ""Tartiflette"" looked like a cheese lover's paradise, so I would order that if you love overflowing cheesy goodness! The ""Lumberjack Omelette"" was so delicious that my friend finished his dish faster than all of us. Lastly, if you are a fan of tuna, I would recommend the ""Tartines, tuna twist"" that looked really good too.

Le Baratin,"Visited Le Baratin for dinner on a casual weekday, and ordered quite a bit of food off of the menu for two people.The vibe and ambiance is quite casual, and reminded me of the some of the great French bistros that I ate at in Paris. We were greeted immediately and given a few minutes to peruse the drink and food menus.For drinks, we ordered a Sidecar off of the cocktail menu, and the gracious server offered to make an elderflower gimlet for my girlfriend. I also ordered a French Connection later in the meal. The drinks were well made, nicely balanced, and had a good amount of booze.As for food, we started with the baked tomato torte (tarte provençale) and roasted beetroot salad (mange de la betterave), which offered a great contrast of hot and cold. I loved the baked tomato torte, and the beetroot salad was a very refreshing way to start the meal. For mains, we ordered the braised lamb shank (souris d'agneau grand-mère), crispy pork belly, and duck leg confit (confit du canard). All three mains were delicious, with my favourite going to the braised lamb shank for being tender and delicious. My only reservation is the amount of carbs that were included, which was a significant amount of potatoes for each dish, but we also ordered three mains so it's somewhat a given that we'd be stuffed.We made room for dessert, of course, and we ordered the creme caramel and tarte tatin. Both were incredibly delicious, and a great way to end our meal. The tarte tatin, in particular, was an absolute treat to eat.Overall, our meal at Le Baratin was fantastic. The drinks were well made and a really great price for cocktails in downtown Toronto, and the food was delicious, providing a great take on French comfort food. I'd love to come back, especially if they add or change their menu, but Le Baratin is a great little place for a delicious night out.",4.0,5.0,55,2016-07-06,43.650078,-79.43514,French
Museum Tavern,"I love this place. It's one of our go-to restaurants when my and my husband are feeling like a bite, but don't want to go too far. I really don't understand the not-so-great reviews, because we have been here at least 6-7 times and have had really good experiences that keep us coming back. The ambience in the restaurant is nice - a bit dark and romantic in the evening. The tables are small, but it reminds of a bit of a crowded bistro. I also love the covered patio during the summer - it has a nice view overlooking the ROM. We normally have pretty good service and the food comes out quite fast. Sometimes our server may not be the friendliest, but the service is prompt, polite and efficient. Most importantly, we always have full drinks and the food comes out right!!!The prime beef double cheeseburger ($19) here is, dare I say it, one of my all-time favourite burgers ever. I think it even outshines Richmond Station's burger (which is really saying something). It is a small burger in diameter, but packed with deliciousness. Two juicy patties, American cheese, very thinly sliced red onion and pickles on a fresh bun? You can't go wrong. The fries here are always on point too - they are piping hot, crisp and just delicious. I would also recommend the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich ($18). This is served with a generous piece of chicken, and a spicy adobo mayo. I have also tried the ginger steak salad, which was not particularly good. The steak was a bit chewy and the salad didn't pack the punch I expected. I guess that's what you get for trying to order a salad....Honestly, the worst meal we had here was during Summerlicious 2017. My husband ordered off the menu, and he got the fried chicken sandwich, the duck buns and a butter tart (if I remember correctly). We have had the fried chicken sandwich before, and he said it wasn't as good. Maybe this is because of the large amount of food the restaurant is pumping out during Summerlicious? I'm not sure.

The second time I came here was drastically different, and was all-around a much more enjoyable dining experience.  Not only was the service much faster and more pleasant, but the food was much better and definitely exceeded my expectations.  I ordered their buttermilk chicken sandwich and found it to be delicious and filling.  The prices are a little bit on the high end here but the quality and service are definitely on point.",3.0,4.0,174,2017-09-23,43.668524,-79.395851,American (Traditional)

Museum Tavern,"The 3.5 average rating makes sense to me, but I'll round up for these guys.According to other Yelp reviews, the burger here has been in the discussion for the ""best burger in Toronto""; so I had to order that of course.  Overall, I'm a fan; I obviously can't say if it is indeed the best burger in Toronto, but it was pretty good.  Best burger I've ever had?  Not quite, but i'd order it again.  If had to compare it to SOMETHING, I would say it's a smaller Shake Shack.  Each bite is really juicy and flavorful; I just wish I could have more.  Fries are okay, but they give you the Five-Guys-Treatment there (a huge load of fries and then an extra cup to top it off).My friends and I also ordered nachos as an appetizer.  Rather than a plate full of loaded nachos, it was 10 chips that were ""individually"" loaded.  While I can appreciate a unique approach to nachos, my stomach desired quantity over quality in this case.Given the classy look / ambience and the food portions, I'd say this is more of a classy-but-not fancy-date kind of place rather than a hangout-to-eat kind of place.  It's conveniently located across the Royal Ontario Museum, and it's a good option if you don't want to eat at the museum itself.",3.0,4.0,174,2017-06-11,43.668524,-79.395851,American (Traditional)

Museum Tavern,"Always wanted to try out this place but never had the chance, so when I saw it on the Summerlicious 2017 list, I finally decided to give it a go. Made reservation in advance and was greeted by the hostess and immediately seated. Our server came to greet us right away and started pouring us some water, which was very much welcomed since it was extremely hot outside that day. He then explained the summerlicious menu and told us his favorites with lots of excitement. I ordered the pork tostada, steak and frites, and blueberry crumble. Didnt have to wait too long between meals. Pork tostada was good, generous amount of pulled pork! Steak and fries was a disappoinment, the steak was small (smaller than the size of my palm) and there's just too much fries on the plate. The presentation was lacking, borderline poor. The cook on the steak was medium well when I asked for a medium. Too lazy to return it since I was starving. The BIGGEST LETDOWN of the night was the blueberry crumble. WHAT A JOKE!! It's exactly what you would find at Starbucks, their blueberry bar. Had 3 bites before I gave up. It was not good.Overall, while the service was great, I won't go back.

The tavern sauce that they put on it was great and there was no shortage of fries. The desert was mediocre.It was kind of weird because they brought out my dessert first, and obviously I had to start eating it right away because it was melting, and I finished and they still hadn't brought out my boyfriends dessert yet. We called it out nicely and it was clearly a communication error, but they brought it for him shortly after.Everything was really good except for my chinsy app. I'd consider coming back.",3.0,4.0,174,2016-02-27,43.668524,-79.395851,American (Traditional)
Museum Tavern,"I didn't want to come here because the word Tavern scares me when you have children. I didn't want to have that feel of going to a bar with your kids. However, once we were inside, we saw other families there with their own kids and high chairs, it calmed my nerves. We were seated in a booth and they had a booster seat for my daughter. It was a nice way to make me feel included since most restaurants that have the name Tavern, isn't exactly kid friendly. To start, we got the beef short ribs poutine and where else can you get good poutine besides Canada? Come on, so of course we had to get it. It was one of the best poutines I've had and I've been to Canada many times. My husband got a cocktail to wash it down with. For out entrees, my girls shared the bacon truffle perogies, perfection of clouds with delicious bacon. I couldn't stop eating their plate, it was that good. I got the shrimp po' boy and oh my! It was one of the best shrimp po' boy I've ever had. Perfect combination of tangy, sour from the pickles, savory and zesty all in one bite. The shrimps they put in the sandwich was also very generous. My husband got the peameal bacon burger which if you know that in Canada, you need to try peameal bacon. It's like a slice of ham. For dessert, they have chocolate mousse and lemon cheesecake. We wanted to have dessert and was going to order one but my daughter said ""mommy, I'm tired, let's just go home"" so that's what we did. She must be very tired to skip dessert so I took that seriously. The tab came to about 78 CAD before a 15% tip. I wasn't used to tipping so little, but in Toronto, 15% is the standard.

I would say it was pretty crowded and loud for Thursday night, I could barely hear my friends across the table. The wait for the food was also longer than average.

Museum Tavern,"It's Summerlicious time, so a trip to Museum Tavern was required. (I've been wanting to sample their wares for years now.)For the appetizer, I went with the Mexican Street Corn Salad (faro, tomato, feta, avocado, lime vinaigrette). This was an impressively large portion and it's a good dish, but I can't say I loved it. Though the very ingredients were used very well and were of high quality, I was expecting something a little more flavorful to reflect the ""Mexican"" part of the dish (ie it could've used some South-of-the-border inspired seasonings and spices).The main was the 24hr Brined Fried Chicken Burger (jalapeno slaw, adobo mayo, brioche bun). I'll admit that I was disappointed by the first bite, as it seemed to consist entirely of deep-fried crispiness. But as I kept eating and I got to the impressively juicy chicken, I began loving this sandwich. The bun and toppings were perfect, while the accompanying fries were above average. (Gotta love a good shoestring french fry.)I finished off the meal with the  Chocolate Tart (peanut butter sauce, chocolate whipped cream), which was much, much better than I might've anticipated.

Museum Tavern,"Inspired by the best burger article in Toronto to come out and was not displeased.Food was excellent, well priced and portioned very well. Service was pure perfection, decor was immaculate and lack of music and television of any kind only increased the entire meal. The burger was cooked wonderfully, the fries were reminiscent of the food truck fare (my favourite type) and the duck buns, which I did not give much credit to - seeing that this restaurant is a self touted tavern - were quite possibly the best stater we had. I also had an old fashioned, which most places will either completely mess up with the wrong ice or poor taste profile. This came in a glass that was pre-frozen 3/4 full of ice and drink on top. Definitely the most inventive solution to this drink I've ever seen.I cannot wait to return and try something new.",3.0,5.0,174,2017-01-29,43.668524,-79.395851,American (Traditional)
Museum Tavern,I enjoyed the MT several times with friends and so decided to go for Summerlicious lunch.  I felt we were being punished.  I had poutine with big cold chunks of curd.  Stirring it with the gravy and fries didn't warm it up.  A minuscule burger on a teeny white bun that turned to paste in the mouth.  Although we were there at 12:00 they were all out of butter tarts.  We had the blueberry crumble instead - I have had better at coffee shops.  It was a cold blueberry square with what seemed to be canned pie filling.  We asked if it could be warmed up.  After some hesitation the waiter put it on the warming area under the heating lights and returned it cold on a warm plate.  Really - a bit more effort would have made a better lunch and I don't plan on going back.,3.0,2.0,174,2017-07-17,43.668524,-79.395851,American (Traditional)
Pasha Authentic Turkish Cuisine,Was there with 7 people on a Sunday afternoon. Made reservation for lunch although when I got there there wasn't too many people and there are plenty of tables so really didn't need a resrvation.  Inside is redesigned and very nice e and modern. Even the parking lot is new.We ordered a cold platter app which comes with 4 cold apps and bread. Also got a huge mixed platter of meats to share as well as a pide  and extra skewers of grille meat. Followed by kenefe and tea. Gotta say thay that overall the food was great. The meats were grilled perfectly were juice and tender. The fresh bread is very nice. The cold humus babaganoush potato salad and eggplant was very nice and plentiful for us to share. The fires and rice on the side are good as well. Overall this place serves pretty decent middle eastern food compared to other spots. My favourite dish is the kinafe. It's much better than other places I've had it. This place is a good place to host people or come for an occasion but definitely not one for daily Turkish eating. There are cheaper Turkish options out there with similar food. But again for the quality of food and ambience and service the pretty penny is worth it.,4.0,4.0,73,2018-01-12,43.708364,-79.342651,"Turkish , Mediterranean"
Pasha Authentic Turkish Cuisine,"3.5 starsBeautiful decor and spacious. Good for groups and large partiesExtensive menu with many Turkish food options. Noticed there were a few dishes only available on weekends.We got the Turkish tea - a bit too bitter for my taste.Adana kebob meal - meat was tender, juicy, and flavourful. Really really good. ADonor pide - meat wrapped in Pastry. Very delicious! Must try. Only available on weekends. A+We had the kunefe for dessert. It's shredded wheat wrapped with mozzarella cheese with syrup. It was pretty delicious! A5% off the bill if you show your Yelp.It is pretty expensive because portions are small. I recall getting two kebobs when I go to other restaurants and it's priced the same. This is why I give this place a 3.5 star. I would give it a 4.5 for food but the price and portion size drops it by one.

My boyfriend ordered Karişik pide, was not bad but not so great. Künefe, on the other hand was amazing, perfectly baked. Künefe is baked in a steel dish on direct flames, can be easily overbaked and burnt, but this one was the best künefe I've ever had in Toronto (I tried it in 3 other restaurants).The only thing is the price, one could say it's a bit pricy.

Pasha Authentic Turkish Cuisine,"I tried this restaurants based on the positive reviews I found on their yelp page, but unfortunately I was highly disappointed and do not think that I would visit again, which is quite bad, because I had some hopes of finding my new favorites Turkish restaurant.The interior decor of the restaurant is beautiful, its light colours and authentic tiles and millwork are very inviting, and certainly set up happy mood once you come.Two major issues here, first one is the menu itself, being an authentic Turkish restaurant, they still miss out on so many great dishes, and kind of cutting it short with the very minimum basics of the cuisine.And the second biggest issue is the food itself, it lacks any type of flavor, Turkish or not, and the portioning is very small, they put shop Pro Tien on top of a puffy piece of bread, so the plate looks very big and appetizing, but the portion Is half what you would expect for $16-$20 per plate, for similar cuisines.We tried a few different items, five appetizers, three types of entrées, and one dessert and unfortunately they all failed to impress.",4.0,2.0,73,2017-10-22,43.708364,-79.342651,"Turkish , Mediterranean"

Pasha Authentic Turkish Cuisine,"I have mixed feelings about this place.My family came here for Mother's Day. It's a Turkish place that serves halal meat (as do many if not most other places in this area). We had a reservation for 9pm. When we went in, it was busy but not so busy that we couldn't pick our table. We didn't get that chance though. We were seated on the side where two large parties with small, fussy babies and children were. This affected our atmosphere.While the servers were helpful and friendly, I found the overall service to be odd. We ordered a chili dip and zucchini patties to start. The server brought out the olives and bread to start. Then we got just the dip (no bread) and the zucchini patties. Not sure if the dip came late for some reason, or if there was accompanying bread that was forgotten? Anyway, the chili dip is not good. But the zucchini patties are amazing.For mains, we ordered the chicken skewers, the adana kebab, the iskender kebab and the Turkish ravioli. The ravioli was the worst thing ordered. the past was small so you could barely taste the meat in it and it was covered in a tangy youghurt and sauce. The chicken was byfar the best meat. It was so succulent and juicy! The iskender kebab is basically the doner kebab with more stuff. It was pretty good. The adana kebab is made of ground veal and it was okay.We finished with pistachio ice cream which was delicious and fragrant (of rose water).There's definitely things I enjoyed about this place and I'd like to come back. However, I wasn't completely wowed, especially considering the price, so returning isn't high on my list of priorities at the moment.",4.0,3.0,73,2017-05-23,43.708364,-79.342651,"Turkish , Mediterranean"

Pasha Authentic Turkish Cuisine,"Guys, honestly I have been dying to eat here since I heard they have pide, but this place was an utter disappointment. The exterior of the restaurant was in shambles, but that can be excused as construction is going on and once you enter the interior - it is spacious, colourful, and welcoming.My mother and I had come here and ordered the doner pide, the cheese pide, and the turkish ravioli called ""manti."" The doner pide had lamb and although, I'm not a huge fan of lamb, the gamey-ness was so strong that I took one bite and passed it to my mother. She couldn't even stomach it herself. The cheese pide was average - I felt the cheese they used could have been of a higher quality with a higher salt content. The cheese was rubbery and lacking in flavour. As for the manti or the turkish ravioli, let's just say that whole dish looks great on photos, but the flavour doesn't compare. Chewy ravioli with a thick yogurt smeared on top - the ravioli claims to have meat inside, but my taste buds didn't get the message. I have a feeling the ravioli is frozen and it really lacks seasoning. A sprinkle of salt really goes a long way.For dessert, we ordered the turkish tea and kunefe, which at a whopping $9, makes you really question minimum wage standards. Both my mother and I really enjoyed the dessert - we saved a little bit of the kunefe the next day and even cold it was scrumptious.I commend Pasha's for providing clean halal food in an alcohol-free setting and their customer service is on point. In fact, I would only return to Pasha's for their waiters & waitresses -- kind, hospitable, friendly and pleasant. We had some great chats with a few of them and it really lifted up our spirits. Pasha's is on the pricier side with not a lot of bang for the buck.

Bolan Thai Cuisine,"This place is awesome! I came here for dinner with a group of friends on Friday night.  This restaurant is very small,  so I highly suggest making reservations. I would say they can at max accommodate 8 people,  but it might be tight.  We were a party of 7 people.  This location is relatively close to the subway and for people that drive,  there is street parking and a Green P parking lot across the street too.  The servers here are friendly and nice.  I like that they constantly came to refill our water glasses without having to ask.  But they weren't over attentive either. Because it is a very small restaurant,  it is not very noisy although they are very busy. We decided to order dishes and a bottle of red to share.  The bottle was not expensive at all...  I thought it was very afforable.  The food here is delicious!!  I think I have found a new Thai Restaurant to frequent. The presentation of the food was pretty,  the flavors were good.  My favorite dishes I think was their signature Pad Thai and the Pineapple Fried Rice.  The Pad Thai they use a very thin noodle which is different from most Pad Thai I've had elsewhere. All the prices on their menu are all afforable.  I am so coming back for more Thai food!!!  I think I am in love....   Lol....",4.0,5.0,57,2017-12-09,43.706481,-79.389336,Thai

The shrimp wasn't very flavourful or didn't really taste of any garlic. It also came with a side of Tum Yum soup (which, is one of my favourite soups ever) and it didn't disappoint.

Bolan Thai Cuisine,"Bolan Thai is a great small little place that offers delicious Thai food located at Yonge and Eglinton. My first impression of the place was that it is small but the decor is quite interesting. There is a shelf attached to the wall with bottles of soy sauce from Thailand and Thai spices. On a humid day the AC is not very strong but they have two fans to cool the place down. In terms of the seats they are mainly wooden tables.Their orange coloured menus are unique, small, and interesting to flip through in terms of the design. The menu is bounded by a plastic spiral holder and each page includes a picture of a destination from Thailand. It was like flipping through a photo book or a postcard collectionThey offer lots of variety. For instance they have variations of red curry such as peanut red curry or pineapple red curry. I decided to try the pineapple red curry.My first impression was that the presentation is very cute as it comes with rice that is moulded into a star shape so it makes it fun to eat. The portions are good as well and comes with a good amount of chicken.As for dessert I highly recommend the mango sticky rice. The presentation was very good and too pretty to want to eat it. The taste was amazing as well as there was lots of coconut flavour. The mangos were sliced, sweet, fresh, and wrapped around the sticky rice like a flower. The texture if the rice was a little hard but I believe it is meant to be like that.

La Vecchia Ristorante,"Finally made it over here, and I'm glad I did. Met with a friend, and made reservations for a weekday, as they still are rather busy. For drinks, I had the Sofia Loren I believe, and it was a nice drink to start, but just a little too sweet for my palette. We ordered a bottle of their pinot Nero, which I had never heard of before. It was so delicious! Not overly sweet or dry, and chilled to perfection. I find red wine can make me feel very sleepy if I'm having it with a larger meal. We ordered the antipasto to start. I did enjoy what I had, but maybe would have preferred more cheese and meat than vegetables. For my main, I had the ravioli which was fantastic! It wasn't like 4 tiny pieces that you get at other places. This was a very filling dish that wasn't heavy, and full of flavour. I also am a sucker for truffles. My friend got the veal special and loved it. Now I would have given this place a 4, but the service was amazing! Raf was our waitress and was cracking jokes with us all night. She came with me downstairs to the bathroom as I am on crutches and offered to help me inside.

La Vecchia Ristorante,I visited this place for brunch. Overall the interior is the best feature. However there were some major issues with the service. There were only a few customers yet they really struggled to visit our table while a few employees were just walking around with no tables to serve.

La Vecchia Ristorante,"I came here on a Tuesday night with a group of friends and the place was packed to the brim. I ordered the soup special which was the potato and leek soup and the Linguini Frutti Di Mare. The potato and leek soup was alright as it came lukewarm and it tasted like a typical cream soup. The linguini frutti di mare was the seafood pasta with tomato sauce. The pasta noodles were great and it really complements well with mussels and shrimps. Overall, the pasta was definitely the highlight of my meal.My friend ordered the capricciosa pizza and it was a huge letdown. For some reason, the dough itself was very salty especially the crust part and with the added toppings like italian sausage, it made it much more saltier. Definitely stay away from the pizzas at this place.Also, stay away from the dessert menu as I tried the caramel crunch. It comes in a huge piece but don't let that size fool you on the taste. There was more cream than the meringue itself and the cream overpowered the entire slice of cake.

I had high hopes for this restaurant but was gravely disappointed with the service and the food. The flavours they have are all wrong. Most of the food was very pungent and did not have a smooth flow of flavours. It was rather sour the risotto we ordered. We also ordered prawns and the sauces they chose were sour and pungent with too much salt. ( it's all in the sauce for Italian dishes). The Gnocchi was okay, it tasted like the Costco brand in a cream sauce ( who could mess up a cream sauce tbh) anyhow I am very disappointed. I did not find the food appetizing at all. The flavours were all mixed up and not great on the palette. My waiter unfortunately was very short tempered and seemed agitated the whole time whilst serving my family and I. Whenever we did need something he was never available and would rush off before we finished speaking with him. Anyway sad to have to review it like this but that is truly my opinion.

It's always nice to meet new people who are not constantly engrossed with their phone. I enjoyed the Calamari Sofia followed by the mushroom risotto. Was it ever good! Wow. I also had some really nice wine with my dinner. At the end of the meal, I received a complimentary glass (just a half-glass, really) of strawberry grappa. So delicious!

La Vecchia Ristorante,"Made reservations here for a Saturday dinner with hubby. The place looked beautiful in pictures and in person and offered GLUTEN FREE options, as well was near the. Ensue we were headed next.We were greater at the door and seated right away, the service was good and the decor was beautiful as mentioned earlier.The place got crowded very quickly and all tables were arranged. Dry close to one another. The place is open concept, very dark and got noisy very quickly. I watched the owners as they were always on the main floor and were regulating staff and attending to the clientele, which was refreshing. The food was brought to us quickly and the boss boys cleared the table as soon as the plates were empty. The food tasted fairly good but not outstanding compared to our many experiences with Italian restaurants.However there were A few flaws, that require attention, when our server came to take our order he refused to place our appetizer order inn first as he preferred to take the whole order upfront. I asked him to please put it inn as we need time to look over the menu and were restricted for time and would like to get the order going, he came back shortly after speaking to the kitchen and said, ok they would do it but prefer to take it all at once as the restaurant is about to get very busy and the kitchen would get slammed (not our problem really, and found that to be an odd pressured request) we ordered the grilled calami which was made and brought to us fairly quickly, it tasted very good and tender a bit on the sweet side and the portion could ha e been slightly more generous  (as compared to other restaurants). We later ordered the mains, we both got the Veal, I got the lemon and my husband got the creamy mushroom version (don't remember the official names)The food was good but a bit bland, mostly the potatoes and veggies that really needed some flavour as well as the veal seemed a bit over cooked and not as tender as expected.We ended up getting the dessert as well, which we don't always do... I had the option of the gluten free chocolate cake which tasted ok and  very much like the frozen cakes from longos, and my husband got the ice cream which they pour the espresso over which was actually very good. We also got 1 order of penne a la vodka (gluten free) for take out, and have to say it tasted  like a very basic pasta smothered in tomatoes sauce with a bit of green onion didn't taste any seasoning or the pancetta.... also the noodles were un-evenly cooked as some were very soft and some had a bit of a crunch..... did not taste like a professional cooked it!As we requested for the bill we received a complimentary limoncello shot, which was a nice gesture. With our bill being over $200 it seemed like a decent and pleasant gesture.Over all not a bad experience many plus and few minus, perhaps a more experienced chef could fix all the problems we've encountered.

The tiramisu was probably the best tiramisu that I've ever had - it was light and airy yet sinfully good. La Vecchia is the place to go to if you're craving authentic Italian food.

But I was hungry, knew I could find something vegan in the Market, and looked up just in time to see the sign saying ""All vegetarian and vegan. No MSG."" I was like YAS!I've been three times now, and have not been disappointed. It's been so filling and delicious, and fresh!! The staff have all been really friendly as well. And this place hasn't jacked the prices up to heaven just because it's veg either - everything is really reasonably priced!The vegan pho that I had was extremely tasty and filling, and while I ordered it spicy, I appreciated that hot sauce was on the table so I could make sure it got my eyes watering just the way I like!The next time I had one of the meals that came with several little portions of various vegan dishes. They were all fantastic, but the Caramel Tofu blew my mind!! It tasted so similar to the Bourbon Chicken I used to get in the US before I moved here and went veg. My friend who came with me also raved about his meal, and was super enthused about my Caramel Tofu as well. We'll definitely be returning!!",4.0,5.0,91,2017-12-13,43.654326,-79.399023,Vietnamese

It's nicely decorated inside with ample seating, good for groups too as there's a long table inside that can fit over 10 people in there. Though this place has a ""pho restaurant"" vibe, so not sure if hosting a party here would be appropriate.Lots of veggie versions of your typical Vietnamese fare, with a section near the end with some Indian options too!I highly recommend their bahn cuon rolls - it's freshly made and tastes amazing. I wish they sold a bigger plate of this for a meal and not an app.The butter chicken was sub par - I think you should stick to their Viet dishes instead - the vermicelli and bun bo hue tastes great!As for desert, I'd recommend you go explore elsewhere - the mango sticky rice was cold and not very tasty.All in all an excellent option for veggie lovers!",4.0,5.0,91,2017-11-25,43.654326,-79.399023,Vietnamese

But again the taste was so good I can't really complain.The restaurant itself was quite spacious and quiet with relatively private booths, which was nice. Service was extremely quick and friendly: no prompting was needed for seating, water, or the menu; there was very little wait for food or the bill as well.

Saigon Lotus,"This is by far one of the BEST viet restaurant left, it's hard to believe it is an all vegetarian/vegan place! As a Viet, viet restaurants are a dime a dozen, yet not many left to impress. It could be very much that growing up eating the food of my people left me jaded and hard to please...or simply because knowing how to make the dishes at home it prompts the question, ""why the hell am I paying for that?!"". I am undeniably fugal, especially when it comes to Viet food...I would splurge on sushi, Chinese food, and even fast food...but never Viet food. I unreasonable EXPECT value and quality for the price I am paying, with that being said...Really this is one of the best I've had thus far. Notable is their quality, I would not hesitate to pay a bit more for this. I am, by all accounts, a carnivore, and if any places that fail to offer meat can still leave me wanting more, it's an A+ in my books. Starting off with the broth, offered alongside the entrees, there is notable depth and umami taste - it does not taste artificial nor does it have the after effects of the overuse of MSG (as most viet places do). Simple clear broth that just simply delicious. We ordered an order each of Steamed Rice Roll with fresh wild Mushroom, the Spicy Lemongrass Tofu, Seiten and Crispy Roll Bun, and Pho Vegan.  Steamed Rice Roll with fresh wild Mushroom - The taste was outstandingly fresh. Steam-rolls can easily go south if stored improperly or for too long. The shelf of these are not long. These came out perfectly chewy and the ""nuoc mam chay"" that accompanied the dish was just as perfect as it can come close to short of having it made table side. It's the right chewiness and ratio of fillings. My only gripe was the lack of bean sprout and herbs that I've been accustomed to.  Pho Vegan, again with the topping and the broth...it was an absolute delight. It is expected that a vegetable broth will not have that heaviness of the usual beef broth, but it was none the less a pleasure to enjoy.  The noodles were a nice slightly al-dente consistency as I prefer, and topping galore. I would've preferred it even more so if the broth had a more distinguishable taste of PHO (ginger, cinnamon, star anise, etc.) but that's my preference. Lastly, the bun was just mind blowingly delish. Much like the non-vegetarian version, the contrast of the fried and grill topping gave the dish its signature smokey, savoury taste. The lemongrass was quite pronounce and was much appreciated. Once again, the ""nuoc mam"" sauce was very well done. The rice noodle, once again, had a lovely consistent chewiness.Hats off to the chef. I hope that the quality will not deteriorate over time and will definitely be back. This is good food at its best, pure unadulterated goodness.TLTR: AWESOME VIET FOOD...FORGET IT'S VEGAN...JUST AWESOME FOOD!!!!",4.0,5.0,91,2017-10-03,43.654326,-79.399023,Vietnamese
Saigon Lotus,"What a pleasant surprise. As someone who has to have some sort of chicken or beef incorporated in every meal, I can say that their pho here was delicious. I ordered their regular pho noodle soup and was very impressed. The broth was rich and flavourful and though just a taddddd bit sweet, it was easy to balance out by adding a bit of lime. My favourite part of this meal, however, was the assortment of tofu and ""meats"". I don't even know what I was eating but there was so much variety of flavour and texture in each bite that it made me completely forget that I was having a vegetarian meal.  I will definitely be back here again given that the price was as cheap as other pho spots and that it was just damn good.",4.0,5.0,91,2017-09-28,43.654326,-79.399023,Vietnamese

I've had some pretty good vegetarian foods too. But the Vegetable Tofu Pho at Saigon Lotus did not meet my expectations at all. The soup was bland, the menus fail to point out which meat substitutes were deep fried, the pho noodles tasted hard and plasticy, and I just didn't feel good after the meal (even though it was cheap and healthy...?!?)The Yelp Check-in discount was great, and maybe the stir fried dishes are tastier, but my two cents?

The pad thai with bbq vegan ""meats"" was my favourite dish. The bbq tofu was nicely charred and packed full of flavour. The noodles were really saucy but my only complaint would be that I would have preferred thicker noodles instead of the thin ones. Finally, the vegan pho was packed full of different toppings and the broth was good (still like the meat broth better though).

Saigon Lotus,"I've been dreaming of the vegan pho here with its deliciously umami clear broth, assortment of vegan meats, and chewy rice noodles ever since my first visit last Friday, so literally couldn't fight off the urge to come here after work tonight for an early dinner. 5/5 service today, much better and way more personal than the first visit when we experienced slow and inconstant service because they were so busy. Tonight at around 6PM customer flow was light, so I had the chance to speak one-on-one with a few staff members - such wonderful people!I ordered the Tuesday special - buy a $4+ drink and get 50% off any entree. I ordered a lychee fresh smoothie with only fresh fruit and ice, no sugar added by my request and tbh the fruit itself is such a wonderful natural source of sugar you really don't miss out on anything by omitting added sugar. Vegan bubble tea (also $4) are another drink option. They also have teas, alcohol, and fruit juices here.I tried the vegan crab and BBQ meat pho (#26) today and wasn't as impressed with it as I was with the vegan pho (#20). There weren't enough toppings or vegetable variety. They put romaine lettuce in there and I'm not a fan of warm, soggy salad-type lettuce. The vegan crab was pretty standard and similar to the grocery store variety, but the vegan BBQ meat was sooo real!!! It even came with the fatty vs. lean layers, just like real pork. It was also seasoned perfectly, so the lean cut especially tasted just like real BBQ pork omg. Lastly I had the avocado-vegan crab summer rolls ($3). This appetizer is really light, but the with miso-peanut sauce it becomes pretty filling. Total bill was just under $13 including tax...

Unfortunately, the dishes were ok but we low quality compared to the price.Also, I would have given more stars had i not waited for my dish while everyone at the table ate theirs.",4.0,2.0,91,2017-06-24,43.654326,-79.399023,Vietnamese

Saigon Lotus,"The first Vietnamese vegan restaurant I've seen and tried in Toronto and it. is. BOMB! The location is in Chinatown and so I thought the space would be very small and not that clean but actually it's very spacious and we didn't have to wait in line. And the service was very friendly and it was almost a hidden spot that's out of place in the busy setting of Chinatown. The food though was the star. We got #46 which was the stir fry pho (interesting I know) and it was deeeelicious! they're very generous on the vegetables as well! And my friend got the combos that they had and again portion size was very generous and from what I tasted, very unique and flavourful. We also got two of the four summer rolls they had and oh man, it was very exquisite and not the generic summer roll that you get in other places. Oh yeah did I mention it came down to $12 per person? When you check in at the place you get 20% off! Make sure you do that. Even aside from that it's very affordable with summer roll being $3 and the main dishes ranging from $9-10. What a steal! Overall a must try vegan restaurant in the city.",4.0,5.0,91,2017-06-05,43.654326,-79.399023,Vietnamese
Saigon Lotus,"Amazing place! Delicate and tasty. Definitely a hidden gem around Chinatown, highly recommend for pho lover and vegetarian.  I came on a Monday night after work, around 615 and the place is half full. This place is nice and quiet. Table and floors are clean and not sticky. They have great variety on menu. The owners are super friendly and food are at a very reasonable price. Had a mushroom steamed rice roll as appetizer, The deep-fried mushrooms on top was a nice touch, love it. Definitely a must try in store. Then we ordered a clear noodle bowl with vegan meat, the vegan version of BBQ meat was interesting to me, as I never really had much vegan food in my life. It sort of tasted like a hard sponge tofu with the BBQ fav on it. Very cool. I just wish this bowl has a little bit more vegetables rather than all the imitated meat and tofu . But everything is delicious. We also had a curry vermicelli! The rich coconut fav in the soup definitely makes the bowl super delicious.  They have taro and yam in the bowl, its surprising how well these items go well with curry. I would definitely come again.",4.0,5.0,91,2017-09-20,43.654326,-79.399023,Vietnamese

Saigon Lotus,Amazing place and food I will definitely come here again I ordered combo 35 which contains some thick noodles with tofu and vegetables. The taste was amazing loved the food. The food was healthy and make u feel light and energetic after. I also ordered the bean shake with ice that they serve in vetnamiz resturants the test is same as other stores. The woshrooms are decent smelled good nothing super fancy​ which is fair enough as the prices are low for this restaurant. The radio channel they were running seemed to lag not sure why but maybe it's for one time problem. Will definitely recommend this place for other friends.

The Gabardine,"The last time we came here, it was because we were craving mac and cheese and chicken pie. I didn't need to think long before I said, I know exactly where to go.I used to love the Gabardine and would come here just for the chicken pot pie...and other times just for the mac & cheese. OK, I might have on occasion come in for both at the same time even.I had forgotten how cramp the space is. And how dark it is. The tables are very close to one another and it's seemingly always busy though. We were lucky though, and didn't have to wait long to get seated. After placing our order and me raving about how good it is here, we got our meal!  Maybe it was an off night, or maybe I had hyped it up too much, but both tasted fairly average. The mac-and-cheese, we thought didn't taste gourmet at all. It was similar in taste to stuff from the box this time. My chicken pot pie was OK, though it wasn't piping hot. It was luke-warm at best and tasted average as well. The portion, fortunately, was not very large but we didn't even finish it.We were a little disappointed, especially given the price ($21 for the mac-and-cheese and $24 for the chicken pot pie). Service was OK, though the waitress didn't come by very often. After taxes + tip, the meal was about $58 or so. Not sure what happened here.

The Gabardine,"I visited the Gabardine on a Thursday night for dinner, around 5:30pm. It is very highly recommended that you make reservations before you go because this place gets full quick. Its a pretty tiny place, with mostly tables for 2. I normally prefer having a little more elbow room when I dine out though, especially in the winter time when coats and bags taking up so much space.After perusing Yelp as I normally do before trying a new place, I decided that the Yelpers unanimously voted the mac and cheese as being one of the best dishes to try here. So that's what I got. Turnaround time was pretty quick and the food arrived in around 10 minutes. THE MAC AND CHEESE WAS GOOD GUYS****It was very heavy though, so heavy that I had to take a break halfway through to let my stomach settle a little. Normally, I'm the kind of girl that always needs a side to go with her food, either hot sauce or veggies or something. Just something that introduces a little variety so I don't need to take the same bite one after another. But in this instance, I was okay. The mac and cheese was seasoned well and the herb breading added some nice textural contrast too. My only quip about Gabardine is that the vegetarian options were limited. I know the menu is small, and that's fine, but I like eating at places where I'm not limited to 1-2 options. I've heard the menu rotates by season so I'd be interested in checking out the Gabardine again during the spring/summer.",4.0,4.0,330,2017-11-06,43.650963,-79.381422,"Desserts , Diners , Breakfast & Brunch"
The Gabardine,"This was one of the best meals I've ever had!  The food was good from beginning to end with appetizer and finishing off with dessert.  I had heard a lot about The Gabardine and especially for their mac and cheese (and chicken pot pies as well).  There were a lot of people there already and dining and drinking on a Monday evening.  I was pleasantly surprised!The Korean Fried Cauliflower arrived first.  This was a small plate with sweet gochujang, Japanese style mayo and nori.  It was a really good appetizer!  The flavours were strong and I enjoyed it smothered all over the fried yet soft cauliflower.  So many restaurants serve savory cauliflower nowadays.The Mac n' Cheese came with herbed breadcrumb crust.  For $2, you could add smoked ham to it and I was so glad that we did so!  (If you come here, you have to add the smoked ham to it as well.)  The Mac n' Cheese was a beautiful portion of macaroni and cheese.  It was seriously the best Mac n' Cheese I've ever had!  The cheese was so flavourful and creamy and coated the macaroni perfectly.  The tender cubes of generous smoked ham just added perfectly to the flavours.  I was in foodie heaven.  I couldn't believe how delicious the Mac n' Cheese was! The Chicken Pot Pie also had a herbed pastry crust.  This was served to us steaming hot.  This was a very heavy and rich chicken pot pie.  It was very creamy inside and quite good too!The two mains that we ordered were both very heavy and carb-heavy.  However, it was so worth it because that Mac n' Cheese dish was the absolute best!We packed up our leftovers of the mains and ordered dessert too.  We ordered the Peanut Butter Frozen Custard.  I've said it before and I'll say it again: I'm not a big peanut butter fan.  Despite that though (and especially because of that), I found this dish to be so, so good -- and you know that says a lot for a non-peanut butter lover!   It had chocolate crumb, an espresso ganache, and salted peanuts on it.  The frozen custard was absolutely delicious.  It smelled and tasted strongly of peanut butter but was so smooth and frozen at the same time.  I don't think I've ever had a dessert like this before.  A very well done dessert!Thus, you can see why I enjoyed this meal so much.  The dishes were all very delicious and so well done.  I loved the cozy atmosphere of the restaurant too.  No wonder The Gabardine is so highly rated!",4.0,5.0,330,2017-10-25,43.650963,-79.381422,"Desserts , Diners , Breakfast & Brunch"
The Gabardine,"Delicious!I started with the gin and tonic, where they infuse their own tonic and sprinkle it with juniper berries. It was delightful. One of my favourite G&T recipes now. I ordered the chicken pot pie, a signature dish. It came out piping hot, but not so hot you couldn't eat it. The herbed pie crust was perfectly crisp on top and moist underneath. Wonderful chunks of carrot and chicken in the white sauce gravy. I did find the sauce a bit heavy for my preference. But yummy and filling. The staff is attentive but not constantly at you. The space is quaint so the noise level escalates but it isn't overly invasive. Definitely on the return list.",4.0,5.0,330,2018-01-22,43.650963,-79.381422,"Desserts , Diners , Breakfast & Brunch"

It was empty but was filled up really quickly with  people in business attire. We were glad we beat the lunch rush for sitting down. We ordered a chicken liver pate with apple butter and toast for appetizer. The portion was small (expected for what it is) but it was on par with the fruity jam. For entree, we got mac n' cheese with breadcrumb crust and smoked ham ($2 more), and also chicken pot pie. We agreed we made the BEST choice. Both of the dishes were so delicious. For the mac n' cheese, those strings of cheese paired so well with the smoked ham. Everyone near us ordered mac n' cheese so it was clearly the winner.

The Gabardine,"I had exactly one drink at The Gabardine, but it was a lovely drink and a lovely spot. I'd definitely go back if I lived in Toronto, and not, say, thousands of miles away in another country.I went with a new friend during a conference at the Sheraton, and wanted to get off campus for a drink, mostly to avoid the sad hectic atmosphere of the lobby bar. The Gabardine was a cute place a quick walk away, and it was blessedly quiet when we went in, at around 4 on a Friday afternoon. No happy hour, which may have accounted for the near emptiness.The Gabardine is a restaurant, but the kitchen was closed between lunch and dinner, which worked for us just fine. It was a small, charming place, neatly decorated with lots of white paint and hanging lights. We sidled up to the cozy curved bar near the entrance and had a leisurely round of drinks.There was a full bar, with a few draft beers and a half dozen cocktail on the menu. I got the Classic Caesar, which is apparently Canada's version of a Bloody Mary, made with Clamato, vodka, and Bloody Mary fixings--in this case, horseradish and pickled pearl onion, olive, and cornichon, with a seasoned salt rim. This was satisfying, briny and flavorful with a bit of heat, and I particularly liked the fresh horseradish. The bartender was friendly, and she did a great job mixing my drink.If I'd had more time in Toronto, I might've gone back to check out the food at Gabardine. It was a sweet little place, with pleasant service and atmosphere, and I enjoyed my clammy Canadian Mary.",4.0,4.0,330,2017-10-24,43.650963,-79.381422,"Desserts , Diners , Breakfast & Brunch"

I'm usually not crazy about sandwiches, but this one had plenty of flavour, and managed to win me over. You have the option of fries or salad on the side, and combined with our sandwiches, it was quite a hefty lunch. My friends ordered the club house and grilled cheese, and neither were able to finish.

First when I looked at the menu what seemed ordinary in the menu was just a list of comfort food. Nothing special, I thought. But wait till you get a taste of what was...ordered. I ordered a simple chicken pot pie. It was creamy, chicken was flavourful and best of all was the puff pastry. That was the right texture and consistency of the first bite. We also tried one of the specials of the night- cod fish and steamed mussels with tomato base stew. The taste is just what you need for a cooling night. Darn right it hits the spot as a comfort food.

After reading raving reviews on yelp, it was a must try!The Mac and cheese had a nice brown crust and was very creamy.

Wine was amazing; they have a VERY extensive list. Their menu is classic and Italian; I ordered the filet mignon which was perfectly cooked. The complimentary bread is also very fresh and tasty. We had the molten chocolate lava cake for dessert which was a good end to the delicious meal.

Sotto Sotto Restaurant,"My boyfriend and I came here for his birthday and we were impressed by the impeccable service given and delighted with the food. The dim lighting, music, decor set an intimate and romantic mood for us. I made us a reservation and as soon as we got in we were promptly seated. Our fav drink is caipirinha which they didn't have all the right ingredients for but made an amazing variation on it which satisfied him. We got the tiger shrimp appetizer subbing extra shrimp instead of calamari - it was good but the portion was small. Nonetheless, we enjoyed with the vegetables and cheese it came with too. I ordered the pasta with salmon and asparagus in a rose sauce and the pasta was cooked to al dante perfection. My boyfriend ordered the fresh fish drizzled it with some lemon and it was SO GOOD. Highly recommend anyone order it! It was excellent. For dessert we had the Tiramisu which was a nice touch, it was light and creamy without being too overpowering or heavy. Overall, we had a wonderful time, the service given was on point and so attentive, our server checked on us to make sure we were happy and made us feel so welcomed and taken care of. This will definitely be a place we come to again. I'm very happy we came here to start off his birthday weekend.",4.0,5.0,67,2018-01-05,43.673732,-79.396524,Italian

Next, we had the mushroom risotto to share, as it serves 2 people, which was perfect.  We are both risotto lovers and love trying it at different restaurants.  When it came, it was very disappointing.  It was hard and undercooked, and we just did not expect that at this kind of establishment, especially when we are paying a premium price.  To end off the night, we had the creme caramel.  They added a candle on it since this dinner was a birthday celebration, which was a nice touch.  The dessert itself was just mediocre.

Sotto Sotto Restaurant,"Incredible! I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. All of the waiters were so warm and friendly and our particular waitress was just the sweetest lady. The food was SPECTACULAR, well seasoned, and cooked with care. The number of celebrities that frequent this place is mind blowing, and after our amazing dinner tonight, I can see why! Now on to the food: Seafood Antipasti - Came with shrimp, calamari, caprese, and grilled veggies. The grilled calamari was outstanding, I would have ordered a plate of just that! (4.5/5)Carbonara - Even though it's a pasta dish one can easily make at home, I urge you to order this! The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente, it was peppery and cheesy and absolutely delightful. (5/5)Bisteca - Good, typical steak! (4/5)Chicken Marsala - The mushrooms were awesome and the chicken was tender. The side veggies are not an afterthought here, they were really tasty. (4/5)And my faaaavourite part of the meal was the tiramisu our waitress gave us, on her, for my sister's birthday. I can't even put into words how creamy and delicious that heavenly slice of cake was. Still dreaming, people. Still dreaming.

Sotto Sotto Restaurant,"We were recently in town for a few days and decided to have dinner at Sotto Sotto. My bf had been before, this was my first time. The concierge at the Hazelton called and reserved a table for two. He also advised that we were celebrating my bday. When we arrived the small bar area was pretty crowded as was the main level. The hostess advised that a table was ready for us on the second level and that there were two larger parties seated up there as well. My bf was not fond of that idea so we elected to wait until a table on the main floor cleared. About 15 mins later we were squeezed into a tiny table in the corner. It was ok , I guess. The place is cute and has a nice ambience. We ordered drinks and here is where things got good... The appetizers. We ordered the seafood antipasti.. it comes with only one of each item so we doubled it.  Calamari, shrimp , these yummy marinated veggies.. it was so good.  Then we split the pear and arugula salad.. yum, yum , yum .. My bf ordered the smoked salmon asparagus pasta dish.  It was an amazing combination of flavors. At the servers recommendation, I ordered a chicken dish that had prosciutto.. I didn't enjoy it at all. Luckily my bf did so I essentially ate his meal and vice versa. The dessert menu did nothing for either of us. They never acknowledged our reason for dining there.. oh well.  Would I go back? Maybe ?

We looked around at other tables and everything looked and smelled good. Generous portions!My friend and I settled on the Roast Lamb and Grilled Quails, with some red caviar to start. We agreed to share since we really had trouble narrowing it down to just these dishes.The caviar was creamy and delicious, first time my friend was having it. The quail was really good, well seasoned. The lamb wasn't exactly what we were expecting although it matched the description on the menu. For some reason, we pictured in our minds, something on the bone, maybe with some grill marks. That's lamb chops! We ordered slow roasted lamb and that's exactly what we got. It tasted good! Even the potatoes and veggies had a lot of flavour.We were presented with a complimentary dessert of honey cake. It was good but the texture was a little coarse for my liking and very sweet.There was a bit of an old-school quality to our dining experience, with murals of Greek Gods and ruins on the walls, and furniture that seemed a little dated but it was also enjoyable.

Pantheon Restaurant,"I've been there twice only this week, and a few times prior to that. I am getting slowly addicted to their food cuz it is very very very good. My favorite is dolmadakis; stuffed grape leaves but not cold like usual, served hot with a lemon based creamy sauce called avgolemono. Oh it is sooooo freaking good! The giant beans are yum, so creamy and soft with a tomato carrot sauce... you just have to try them. The village salad comes with a very generous portion of feta chunk (actually three chunks of feta), lots of thick olive oil and oregano. Only good stuff....Grilled octopus entrée must be one of the best you can ever have. Their grilled calamari is equally good as well as the fried calamari appetizer. Revani dessert is like a soft bread soaked in syrup and some authentic flavors. I basically never had anything that I didn't like there yet. The owner is very nice. Service is usually descent.

We settled on this place after another spot that Lee and our other friend turned out to not be there anymore.It was a bit of a tight squeeze getting all four of us (3 guys who are at least 6ft tall, and then me) into a table in this jam packed restaurant, but the service was really quite nice. Lee and I got souvlaki plates, Lee's brother got a giant Greek Salad, and our other friend got a dish that totally escapes me.

Pantheon Restaurant,"We had a really delicious dinner here! We arrived at around 6pm and were seated immediately. The servers brought us bread and water right away while we looked at the menu. We decided on chicken souvlaki and the fried calamari appetizer. The calamari was fried nicely but was soft and fresh tasting. Priced at around $16, it's a bit expensive considering their main dishes are around $15-$25, but still worthwhile for a calamari fanatic like me. The chicken souvlaki was outrageously juicy and delicious. I'm not sure how they cook it to be so juicy but it's some of the best souvlaki I've ever had, possibly the best chicken I've ever had, plus it was white meat, which is harder to cook to that sort of perfection. This meal is served with a Greek salad, which was dressed nicely and topped with a healthy portion of feta cheese, and on the side of the chicken comes some rice, potatoes and carrots. The carrots and rice were good, I wasn't crazy about the potatoes, I would probably ask for extra carrots next time, they were really delicious. The small souvlaki portion is quite large, even for a big eater, it's likely enough food, but there is a large option for $3 extra. At the end of the meal we were brought a piece of cake which was a nice, unexpected treat! The cake almost had a cornbread-meets-vanilla cake texture, and was soaked in some type of syrup which made it sweeter, I loved the cake and thought it was a nice gesture. The service is no-nonsense, efficient, our waiter in particular wasn't especially sweet or anything but he was quick and effective. Some of the other guys who brought us food would talk a bit more or make a quick joke but didn't hang out excessively. They run a tight ship and they're good at it! The restaurant is very similar to other Greek spots on the Danforth, decorated Greek-style with murals depicting Greece and Greek sculptures on the walls. They can likely use a bit of a facelift but I like that it's sort of classic Danforth.

Pantheon Restaurant,"The lovely gentlemen waiters made this restaurant so cozy and nice. The conversed with us and made us feel right at home. We ordered the chicken souvlaki with potatoes and salad on the side, and the Ortykia (quail) dinner. Huge huge portions here and we could barely finish our meals. Chicken souvlaki - often times I find chicken over cooked and dry and therefore usually avoid ordering chicken souvlaki of any kind. Considering the reviews of this restaurant and how it's situated right in Greek town, we must give it a chance. We are glad that we did because the chicken was so ridiculously tender and moist, so much flavour. Absolutely loved it. Ortykia - The quails were tasty to the bone but a bit dry when it came to the white meat. I wonder if there is a more polite and quicker way to eat quail because it's such a small animal to begin with and the bones are small and numerous. Nonetheless, worth trying for sure.

Tacos 101,"I've gone here 3 times in 3 weeks?  It's pretty good.  My faves are the fish taco and one of the meat ones, but I totally forget the name.  I think it's Al pastor.  I agree with Al L, the Al Pastor was a little dry this week, but in previous weeks its been fine.  2 tacos are a good size for lunch.  I was pretty full afterwards.  My coworker got his taco with no onions.  I'm going to try that next time.It's tasty here, and I'm totally coming back.",4.0,4.0,145,2017-10-13,43.65644,-79.37684,Mexican
Tacos 101,"I used to really enjoy this place, but my last two experiences here has really killed it for me. Wherever I eat, I always ask for no onions. I know this annoys some, but I am not the only person in the world that cannot eat an ingredient. And I will eat ANYTHING! Just not onions. When I started coming to Tacos 101 I would request that they omit the pico de gallo because I can't eat onions. Every time they had a hard time understanding what I meant. I know, it must have sounded insane to ask for tacos with no pico de gallo. And I would have loved tomatoes etc. on my taco, but I know the onion is mixed with it already. Anyway, most of the time they got it right. My order would always be a fish taco and an al pastor. The fish taco would come with cabbage and mayo, and the pork would have an avocado spread, cilantro and pineapple. Two weeks ago I ordered 4 tacos to go, and asked that two have no onions. I explained it several times to the guy making the tacos and the girl at the cash. I knew they understood because they spoke in Spanish, I am Spanish, so I understood the order she gave the cook. Feeling confident that it would all be okay, I took the tacos to go, and when I opened them with my boyfriend, only one had no onions, so my boyfriend ate my second one. They messed up the order even after breaking it down in two languages.For the first time today I ordered tacos from Tacos 101 using a delivery service, and in the section where you are supposed to give the restaurant instructions, I asked, in caps for no onions. When I received my order, every taco was swimming in onions. Immediately after seeing them in there, I became sick and had to throw them out. I contacted the delivery company and they asked the restaurant to make them again. The new order had tortillas, pork and fish. No toppings!! Are you kidding me???!!! I literally got four dry tacos. Not even herbs!This experience made me feel like they were insulting me and mocking me. I am not a picky eater. There is just one thing I cannot eat. Please have some respect. Needless to say, I am never returning. What a shame.Update: I lied - the last four tacos did have some toppings buried in it - chunks of raw white onion.

Tacos 101,Hmm Toronto is certainly getting interesting with taco places to try out.I had the veggie & fish taco. Cost me $9 something So the price is alright. The tacos are overflowing.They have salsa sauce which adds more flavour and zing.Overall I want to go back to try the others. I was pleased with the overall flavours. I didn't find it too bland but not as perfectly executed as cafe playa cabana or 7 lives but it's a worthy enough. And if you're in the area it's a good choice.

The combination of fried cod with cabbage was just perfect. However, Al Pastor was awful. I didn't even finish it. It was so dry, hard to chew, and taste nothing. The only thing that I can taste was pineapple. The meat quality was bad. The worst point about this restaurant is way too cold inside. I was shivering while I was eating.

Tacos 101,"This tiny joint serves affordable tacos that are generous in portion size and authentic in preparation as well. The only negative here is that the taste of their tacos tend to be a bit on the bland side. Despite using spit-grilled pork to prepare their al pastor tacos, the meat was fairly dry and tasted unseasoned. The same could be said of their fish tacos too, which I found to be lacking in flavour. They have made some strides in improving their food, however, since the time of their opening. I notice that they now add a generous amount of pineapple to both their fish and al pastor tacos. This ingredient certainly adds a much needed kick of sweetness and tart to their bland tasting protein. There is still much more room for improvement, however. For some immediate reprieve of your taste buds, you can try adding one of their 3 house made salsas to your tacos for free! You can sample these after ordering as well, since they usually have some nachos near the cash for this purpose. All in all, a great place to pick up some filling tacos while on a budget (most of their tacos go for $4).

Very unique flavours too, for eg I got the fish taco and they added mango in there to spice things up. Very affordable.

The chips are different from regular tortilla chips so that was nice, and the salsa has a bit of a kick but it isn't too spicy, which I like. The only downside is that the actual place is literally a shack--very tiny, not much seating, and no AC, so on a hot day, expect to sweat buckets. I know Ryerson University is nearby so I feel like this is a good takeout option for students. Would recommend for all the taco lovers out there.",4.0,4.0,145,2017-08-23,43.65644,-79.37684,Mexican
Tacos 101,"These tacos are okay. They are very large, and two is enough for a meal. While it may be headed in the right direction, I wouldn't say they're the most authentic tacos but fairly tasty. I had fish taco and al pastor. The fish was flakey but the al pastor was a dry, so a bit disappointing. Prices are about $4 a taco, but since they're fairly large, its a good deal. Two tacos and a horchata was about $11ish. The horchata was okay, but a bit too grainy for my liking. The place was pretty busy, with a constant flow of blue and white collar workers coming in for lunch.

Tacos 101,"I am not a huge taco kinda guy (burritos are the way to go), but I did want to try this place out. It has that ""kiosk chic"" kind of feel to it, as it literally is as big as a kiosk. You are able to sit outside as they have a fully open-able window - basically you sit outside facing in. I kind of liked that. I also enjoyed the portion sizes, as many people commented on here already. They are quite sizeable. I had three tacos and was super full, which is not the case usually with taco places. So kudos for that.On the other hand, the tacos were just ok. I thoroughly enjoyed the Al Pastor, which was by far the most superior one. The other two I tried (Carnitas and Chicken Adobado) were just forgettable. Somehow they had no kick and the flavour just wasn't there. Not bad by any means, but I could have just had three Al Pastors and I would've been great. The thing that stood out to me the most is actually the free salsa - it is DELICIOUS! It has a nice smoky flavour, which is just excellent. I would only go back for the Al Pastor and to maybe try their fish taco or the other ones I haven't tried before. The decor is super cute and ""authentic"" (take it how you want), but it's a tiny place. You'll probably end up just taking out and eating somewhere else.

Their salsa is very good, however be careful with the hot one as it might be too much for some people. In front they have a bowl of tortilla chips together with mild, medium and hot salsa to try. Overall, the tacos are pretty good and service is fast. Place is tiny so don't expect to get any seat at rush hour. I give this place 4 stars. The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that although the flavour was there, the meat was a little dry. However, it's definitely worth trying!",4.0,4.0,145,2016-12-31,43.65644,-79.37684,Mexican

This was very inconvenient. - My co-worker wanted no avocado in her tacos, they warned her that it may contain ""avocado water""... Strange. I wanted avocado in mines and didn't get any :(- My Al Pastor taco was dry, and there was only one small piece of pineapple.- The fish taco was good. I'd order this again. - I really liked the chips and salsa. Decent portions and the salsa tasted fresh.The place was very cute, colourful and small. No tables to sit down at, just 4 barstools by the window. I'd recommend walk-in and takeaway only.Overall, it is a decent taco place. I'm sad I didn't get any guac/avocado, but just a one-off.

Tacos 101,"3.5 STARSFish taco at 101 is simple, clean & fresh tasting.  Nothing fancy and unpretentious.  I prefer eating here than at Seven Lives Tacos because mainly it's not a hipster hangout where people think what they are eating is authentic.  Most importantly the tacos at 101 are more believable as a staple in a Mexican household because the staff preparing the tacos speak Spanish as their native tongue.  And economically, it's about $2 cheaper for the same product than at Seven Lives.Self-serve homemade hot sauce station is available on the counter.  Adding both mild and medium hot sauce gives it more flavour.

For a more broth like soup that's not too heavy but still flavourful, try the oxtail bone soup. It's perfect for a chilly day.No matter what you pick though, it's probably going to be delicious.

Chaban,"I am new in the area and was looking for some good authentic Korean food on the weekend. I read the reviews on yelp and decided to give this place a try with my fiancee who is also Korean.As per reviews there is minimal parking out back behind the restaurant, be prepared to park further down the residential side streets within walking distance. There was a short line when we got in which was a good sign indicating the place was popular.When we sat down we were greeted with friendly service. Being insanely cold that day we ended up ordering a serving of pork bone soup each and kimchi pancakes for sharing. Before the food came, we were given hot korean tea. When the food came they were accompanied with the regular Banchan (shared side dishes) which were clean and tasty. The pork bone soup that also came with rice was very delicious and not greasy at all. Some of the best soup I've had in the GTA. It had the perfect amount of spice for me where I could still taste my food. The portions of pork was very generous and pancakes were a hit.Overall we both agreed this place was a new favourite hotspot to add to our list in the neighbourhood as we want to try more dishes. The place could use a little bit of face-lift but asides from the that, no real complaints for affordable clean, delectable, authentic Korean food.Edit: Came back yesterday after work to try their dolsot bibimbap that I saw on their menu that peeked my interest.

Chaban,"My family and I were craving Korean food and this was one of the few places that was opened on Easter Sunday. The place is a good size for a family-run restaurant. The decoration was okay, modern and clean. We were seated immediately when we got there. We ordered a bunch of stuff to share amongst the 4 of us: Chaban Dolsot Bibimbap ($11.99), Seafood pancake ($14.99), Pork Bone Soup ($8.99), Bean Curd Dreg Stew ($10.99), LA Kalbi ($18.99). The chaban Dolsot bibimbap was highly recommended by yelpers and it sure was the best dish of the night! There was quite alot of ""filling"" or meats/veggies and an egg in the dish. The rice at the bottom was crispy, which is my favourite part of the dish. The Pork Bone Soup was very disappointing. This is my dad's favourite dish and he was quite excited to eat it when it was served to him boiling. However, as he took a few bites, he complained that it was COLD on the INSIDE. We all took a few bites and we thought the same. The soup might look boiling on the outside, but it is obvious they just reheated the meat and didn't boil it long enough. We called one of the waiters over and told him our concern, but he didn't really know how to deal with it. In fact, he looked scared that he might need to give this dish for us for free. He just stood there for a few seconds didn't know what to do or say (no, there wasn't a language barrier as he could speak English very fluently). So we suggested that he reboils the PBS. He gladly agreed to do so. The seafood pancake was also very good! It was eggy and fluffy, just the way my family likes it. There was a good amount of seafood in it. I liked how it wasn't oily at all. This restaurant was one of the few restaurants that served my favourite Bean Curd Dreg Stew. It is basically grounded up tofu stew with meat and kimchi. As expected, it came boiling (literally bubbling everywhere). I've had this stew many times in Korea, but this one tasted very weird to me. I am not sure what it was, perhaps the tofu? The taste was off. My mom ordered the LA kalbi because she saw another table order it and it looked delicious. It wasn't anything special; it was pricey and it was quite salty to me. THE PROBLEM:  Several hours after the meal, my dad started having abdominal pain, diarrhea, and all sorts of food poisoning symptoms. Then, a little while later, both my mom and brother experienced the same thing as well. We were trying to figure out which dish had the problem and we concluded that the PBS might be problem because they all had the most and I only had a spoonful. Not sure if it was because they didn't boil it enough in the first run or it was just NOT MADE FROM SCRATCH and JUST REHEATED IT, but it scared us a lot. Because of our food poisoning experience, we will definitely NOT return. Also, Overall, everything here was $1-2 more than other Korean restaurants and other places had better quality of food and service.",4.0,2.0,93,2017-05-21,43.624791,-79.510434,Korean

Came her on a Thursday night at 6 pm and there was no one in the restaurant. The waiter was friendly and but didn't seem to speak much English.I ordered the kimchi fried rice with an egg on top ($10.99) and the dumpling soup ($9.99). The fried rice was okay. It wasn't spicy at all and didn't have a strong kimchi flavour to it. BUT the dumpling soup was amazing; it hit the spot for a cold day. The broth was light and the mandu was so good!

Chaban,"Discovered this hidden gem, which is now my new favorite Korean spot. Great variety, good portions, reasonably priced. Menu is condensed enough that it listed out on 1 page that serves as a placemat. It has the typical Korean restaurant fare, but I liked some of the few extra things they add just to make it a bit different.If you are looking for a starter, I recommend the kimchi pancake. The crunchy texture was really addictive and had me craving more even when I was full. Some places tend to over-do the starchiness of the pancake, but not here!I ordered the Mushroom Dolsot Bibimbap as my main, which I would reorder again if I was craving a vegetarian option. The rice was perfectly crunchy, had a large portion of vegetables than I expected to rice, and the sauce is flavorful but not overwhelming. Gamjatang (pork bone soup) here hits the spot on the cold day. Compared to other Korean restaurants, the pork bones were rather generous and meaty as well as not being too greasy. Ordered the pan-fried noodles with beef (essentially bulgogi with vegetables on stir fried udon) and I liked the flavor. Overall, I'm inclined to think there aren't any ""bad"" dishes on the menu. The restaurant is quite small, so it can get quite busy depending on the time you go and parking is very, very limited (better off parking across the street if you had there for dinner).",4.0,4.0,93,2017-01-15,43.624791,-79.510434,Korean

Chaban,"I haven't had good Korean food in a while and I'm not including the Korean fried chicken/beer kind of place.  This restaurant is NOT one of those as it's a real sit down, well lit, not everything is deep fried, family style Korean place.  Sure they have those common water decanters and yes they also happen to serve beer to but it's not a bar, it's not a pub it's a legitimate non fried chicken type of place.  The closest thing they have to fried chicken on the menu is probably chicken katsu which I also like but there's so much more to offer and on the menu here not to mention the place upon entering smells absolutely divine.  Whatever else everybody else is already eating... take a peek.  Don't gawk too long because that's rude but yes, have a look and you'll probably say to yourself, ""dang I like that and wow does it ever look and smell great!"".  Mouth water dishes... the sound of sizzling plates brought to your table... portable burners brought to the tables and being lit!  Hey we're still in Etobicoke right? I can see how this place can make you forget.I have to admit I was hungry.  I had food on my mind REALLY badly before coming here.  I ended up parking in the parking lot in the back where there seems to be a BMW with a destroyed front driver side covered with a tarp.  I didn't park beside that car... still I parked and I was so hungry I left my phone in the car... oh and I didn't even turn off the engine before I got out.  I forgot!  Yes, I shut the car off after the car was beeping as the key got too far away.The restaurant was more than half full upon entering and yes there was that wonderful smell of great food and that sound of sizzling steaming hot plates.  I love this cuisine.I ended up ordering the Chaban bibimbap stone bowl and it was exactly what I wanted.  That rice getting slightly crunchy on the hot bowl... mushrooms and beef, veggies made a really nice mix and then the egg on top is like a cherry on top of a sundae... you complete me (said the bowl of food to the egg).  A side of chili paste and a bunch of other sides you know the usual pickles, sprouts, kimchi, etc.  Korean always has side plates for other stuff.  I like that.I had ordered a starter of galbi which had about 5 or 6 pieces.  It was served sizzling on top of onions and hey that smell of sizzling beef with onions... ya that's a winner.Besides the meat and stone bowl we also started off with some Max Korean malt beers because we wanted the experience to be complete.  I am sometimes asked in all the places I go for to have Korean fried chicken if they serve Max... well this place does serve Max so there's your answer.  My friend had the bbq pork ribs and that too came sizzling to our table.  The food here is really good and I can safely say because of that I really want to return.  There's so many dishes to be had here I want to try everything because there's so many things I saw others have as well where I was actually jelly of their dishes while I was eating mine.  Sure I'm greedy but hey the food here looks, smells, sounds and tastes great!  How can I help it?They also happen to sell their kimchi for take home.  They have two examples of the contains they have where one is a small reasonable sized container for 5 bucks and the other is almost 4 liters and is over 30 bucks!  Their kimchi is so good I can see myself taking some home one day.",4.0,4.0,93,2016-06-23,43.624791,-79.510434,Korean
Chaban,"Impressive! Definitely one of the better (if not best) Korean restaurants in the west end. Modern yet quaint, very clean, extremely attentive and friendly servers, and most importantly, delicious food with decent portion size. First, the parking situation. This place is located just east of Queensway & Islington Ave, and it can be a bit difficult to find street parking along the Queensway at certain times of day (if any). We ended up finding free parking on one of the residential streets just north of the restaurant (a minute walk away).Second, the ambiance. Decent amount of tables (there's even a private party room at the back). It isn't a big restaurant, but it's a decent size. It's very, very clean and well-maintained - tables are spic and span. Servers greet you right away with a smile and have no qualms going through the menu with you.Third, the food. A pretty extensive menu and various specials listed on the board by the entrance. After glancing at the different types of Bibimbap available (Dolsot, Chaban, etc), my first noob-ish question was ""excuse me, what's *Chaban* Bibimbap?!"" Apparently, ""Chaban"" isn't a ""thing"" per se, it's the style of cooking. The Chaban Bibimbap at this place has a couple of special ingredients that the classic Dolsot doesn't have: bellflower and ""bracken"" (another type of plant). So we ended up ordering a) the Chaban Bibimbap, and b) the Beef Bulgogi with rice. Everything was DELICIOUS - and, the best part, they don't skimp on the meat! They were very generous on the portions of beef in both dishes. Everything was flavourful, comforting, and of very good quality.Overall, a great experience. Casual yet clean. Flavourful, homestyle dishes. Great music and bright atmosphere. It's a bit pricier than your usual Korean restaurant, but the apparent quality makes up for it. I didn't come in here expecting much, but left very satisfied.For two people, with tax, and tip (no drinks), we paid around $35.00.",4.0,4.0,93,2016-06-13,43.624791,-79.510434,Korean

Hancook Cheese Dakgalbi,"I should preface this with the fact that, in my opinion, I make the best dak galbi ever at home, just because it's made precisely to my preferences. But when I'm too lazy to do the work, and because I'm a dak galbi fiend who craves it regularly, I like to know that I can go somewhere that does it well, and I'm happy to report I've found my place.This was much better than any experience I'd ever had at Joon's - refer to my review for more detail.I was super pleased to learn that this place offers single servings of dak galbi for solo diners, so I came here by myself on the weekend. As everyone else had already mentioned, the banchan really wasn't great, but it wasn't a huge deal. Service was courteous but minimal, which was just fine with me.My platter came after a short wait and it was covered - and I mean COVERED - with cheese. My kind of heaven! I added ramen to my order, and it was cooked just right - not too soft, not undercooked. There wasn't a ton of chicken/veggies, but with my ramen I was stuffed, and I didn't need to order rice on top - so I think the portions were pretty reasonable. The sauce was deliciously savoury but quite a lot sweeter than I expected (and sweeter than when I make it), but it was pretty good, all things considered. I really liked that they used dark meat - it's the only way to do it.I did make the mistake of ordering ramen with mine while I was wearing a white shirt, so I got tiny, little spots of sauce on my shirt that won't wash out, unfortunately. But it was worth it!Something else I'd like to note is the fact that, unlike Joons, they don't charge extra for veggies, which is how I think it should be. Veggies should be a default ingredient and it is, here. I'd absolutely return, and next time, with a companion!",4.0,4.0,29,2017-07-10,43.664598,-79.41312,Korean
Hancook Cheese Dakgalbi,"I came here with friends around 9pm (1 hour before closing on Sunday) and the establishment was still popping with diners.  This is a very good sign, especially since this is in the heart of K-town (Christie Station/Bathurst Station) where there are many other competing Korean restaurants.  We ordered:- Dukbokki: It was very cheap with it being 6-7 dollars before tax and tip, but the portion size was very small, even though it was to act as a shareable dish.   It did not have many slices of tofu skin or other ingredients besides the rice cakes, which may appeal to some, but I generally prefer having an even mixture. - Dukgalbi (without cheese 'cause a friend was lactose intolerant - poor him!): This was about 9 dollars and it was portioned large enough for two people with average appetites.  It had a good mixture of suace, chicken, and vegetables.  My companions liked this dish the most out of what we ordered and I do admit that it was very good for the price and portion size.  This is their staple dish and I do recommend purchasing this, as I do not see this being served very often in other restaurants in the area. The only down-side with this is that, unlike their other entrees,  this does not come with rice.  Rice is very cheap, fortunately ($1 per bowl).  If you're restricting your carb-intake, don't sweat it!- Grilled pork hot plate (forgot the name): This was my favourite dish out of the three.  It was very flavourful and the pieces of pork were small enough to create a burst of saucy goodness in your mouth.  This was the same price as the Dukgalbi, and it was only a little smaller in portion-size. - Red bean bingsu: This was FREE!  Unlike the ubiquitous green tea/mango/red bean ice cream that many people are accustomed to receiving as a complimentary item after their dinners, the staff here serve red bean shaved ice.  It was very refreshing and the red bean had a good sweetness to it.Overall, my companions and I really liked the restaurant.  For my bf and I, this will be another date spot as the prices were very fair and we will come back for the cheese dukgalbi.

Hancook Cheese Dakgalbi,"We came here on a Sunday night and the restaurant was reasonably packed. We ordered the cheese dakgalbi for two, with the initial thought of having fried rice with the leftover sauce at the end (to get the fried rice, there was a minimum of a ""two people"" order since it was served on a hot plate if ordered for one). Neither my boyfriend nor I liked rice cakes so I asked if we could have the rice cakes replaced by something (e.g. more cabbage, white rice) but the waiter refused because the whole dish for two only had 3 rice cakes, which I found quite stingy especially since it was a two people portion. The dakgalbi was very tasty and quite spicy (if you are not used to eating spicy, I'd recommend to ask to have it toned down). What was disappointing though was the amount of food we got and we couldn't even order fried rice at the very end because there was no sauce left in the pot to fry the rice with. Overall, the food tastes good but the portions are below average, I'd recommend, if possible, to get a three person size for two if you are big eaters.",4.0,3.0,29,2016-09-19,43.664598,-79.41312,Korean

For example, one portion of dajgalbi only has two rice cakes which, oppose to other restaurants, is quite low. There should be larger portions for its price. The location is convenient since it's located just in Koreatown. Their bibimbap and fried spicy rice is also okay as well.",4.0,3.0,29,2016-11-27,43.664598,-79.41312,Korean
Hancook Cheese Dakgalbi,"So I've been noticing, cheese on Korean dishes seems to be a hit with the foodie community recently. I was curious and wanted to give it a try. To be honest, at first it seemed like an odd combination but having tried it, its delicious! If you like cheese and spicy Korean dishes, you'll want to give this combination a try. We ordered the cheese dakgalbi. Dakgalbi is essentially chicken, cabbage and rice cake in a spicy pepper sauce. The cheese version has cheese drizzled on top. When you order dakgalbi (cheese or no cheese) you can order a single serving or a double serving. You can also add in things like rice, ramen or more chicken, cabbage and etc at an extra cost of course. My cousin and I opted for the single serving and added ramen with it.  We also ordered a pork bone in case the single serving wasnt enough. The dakgalbi came out sizzling on a hot plate. It was super delicious. The ramen was a perfect add on. I don't think it would've tasted as good had we not ordered it with ramen. The cheese was stringy, the sauce was spicy and sweet and the ramen was cooked perfectly. There was only 4 rice cakes in ours which I personally thought was very little but I'm not a huge fan of rice cake anyways. Unless you really love dakgalbi, I personally think sharing a single serving and second dish would be the better way to go if it's just two people.",4.0,4.0,29,2017-01-07,43.664598,-79.41312,Korean

We are always on the lookout for a great seafood pancake (we have been disappointed at times) and this one was top notch.

My friend and I were in the area and wanted some good old Joon to only find out its been replaced with Hancock Cheese Dakgalbi. After walking back and fourth in denial we decided to give it a chance. Upon walking in we were greeted by the owner who was very friendly and told us how the menu worked. We ordered two orders of the Chicken with rice cakes ramen and cheese. We were amazed .. at the portion, it was a lot more than what Joons would usually give. The flavour was not the same the sauce was sweeter than spicy and the chicken wasn't as fresh as Joons would usually provide. Without comparison, this place wouldve gotten a better review but if you are going to open up in the exact same spot serving the one thing people would go there for, there is going to be a comparison.Overall the dakgaibi isn't terrible but it isn't the same, we did not try anything else because dakgaibi itself is very filling for 2.

My friend got the pork soup or something and that was pretty good, it came bubbling hot. However my dakgalbi was a lot more expensive then I expected, $14 with tax and I had to add tips on top of that. My friends meal was only about $8, so I spent almost double. For the side dishes, we didn't get any of the usual stuff like kimchi. Instead we got blocks of radish, some macaroni and corn.

I ordered a Jerk Chicken plate which consists of the chicken breast, veg (edamame + broccoli), wild grains rice, and this mango salsa thing that was just a hint of spicy. My dude ordered some burger thing that had bacon and fries with it. The jerk chicken was ... the best grilled and marinated chicken I've ever had. It was flavourful and juicy, and the chicken retained its natural chicken taste. It goes superbly well if you eat it with the mango salsa. Their broccoli was great and juicy as well. I felt neutral about the wild grains rice but that's only because I don't like wild grains anyway... but it was still delicious. Jerk chicken was 5/5. Fries were also 5/5. They came salty (even though I didn't see the salt on it). It was crispy throughout and the oil it was fried in was not old. I loved it. So why 4 stars? Because their drinks menu. I know they pride themselves on their tap selection, but I was really hoping they could have some Japanese selections too, although I guess that isn't very sports bar-ish.

They also have some very large table so large groups are not a problem. The food on the other hand was disappointing and for one common reason. The French fries simply under cooked in the middle and not crispy. It seems like they forgot about the par cooking part and just hit them with the high heat. My colleague and I shared the buffalo chicken poutine. It was pretty good but neither of us could really eat the fries. My entree was the fish and chips.

I thought this was pretty thoughtful, especially considering we were only paying the price for one. It worked out perfectly. The salad was very good. The sandwich was also very tasty. The chicken was not dry and the sun dried tomato sauce on it complemented the sandwich nicely. We grabbed some drinks beforehand, as well. The drinks were reasonably priced, considering it is in the heart of downtown Toronto. They have several different beers to choose from and the over all atmosphere is very rustic.I would definitely recommend stopping in here for a drink or a quick bite to eat.

The Loose Moose,"After we walked in, we seated ourselves at an empty table of our choice and then our server greeted us shortly afterwards.  The place was popping with a lot of people hanging about either watching the huge sports TVs or socializing.  It was a loud place but I was still able to easily hear the person next to me.  I got the Warm Chocolate Brownie which was actually really, really good!  (Possibly one of the best brownie desserts I've had to date!)  It was a classic warm double chocolate brownie that came with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzled with chocolate sauce and roasted peanuts.  I'm not even a fan of peanuts usually but these scattered roasted peanuts worked really well with the dessert.  The warmth of the double chocolate brownie paired with the cold and sweet vanilla ice cream was perfect.  I gobbled it up quickly since it was so good.  For $6, I also thought it was such a generous dessert considering it was a restaurant in the downtown core.K got the Chicken & Waffle Sandwich (Southern fried buffalo chicken, dill-vinaigrette slaw, roasted garlic aioli) with came with mixed greens (or you could choose a side of fries or chopped Caesar).  It looked great.  I tried it bite of it and it was good.  The mixed greens were also very fresh and a good size.I was intrigued with their craft beers and beer on tap.  Their drink menu showed that you could try a sample of the beer (3 oz) for just $1.31 which I thought was such a steal and so much fun to do!  Thus, we ended up ordering two rounds of 3 oz beers to try.  I would definitely come again for food and drinks.",3.0,4.0,289,2017-05-09,43.645232,-79.383897,"Sports Bars , Gastropubs , Canadian (New)"

The Loose Moose,"The Loose Moose is a popular sports bar right across the street from the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. It becomes all the more popular during Leafs and Jays games because of its proximity to the Rogers Centre. The place itself is a 2 floor restaurant/bar with a basement/cellar that is just a cool as the top floor. People come for the beers and drinks, as they have one of the largest selections of draught beers in downtown. I had to have some food before the Jays game, so we shared a pair of apps. Fish tacos and pork belly sliders sound good enough. The crispy haddock used in the fish tacos were very good, while the cabbage slaw added the bit of crunch to pair with the softness of the corn tortilla. The pork belly sliders were good but so damn greasy. Every bite we took had oil dripping so that wasn't the greatest. The pork belly was very tasty though and the buns were buttered too. The place gets absolutely packed during game days and the environment is great because everyone is all pumped and excited (and not yet drunk). The wait for tables can be long, but there are usually spots at the bar that open up if you don't care.",3.0,3.0,289,2017-04-04,43.645232,-79.383897,"Sports Bars , Gastropubs , Canadian (New)"

The Loose Moose,"Late night dinner after delayed flight arrivals found me here at the sports bar - not much else was open where the kitchen was still cooking. I was hesitant at first because it really appeared to be a place focused on drinks, and I was hoping for a decent meal despite the late hour. Self-serve seating, and a waiter dropped by with menus shortly after. He was friendly and helpful - the beer list was long and I didn't even know where to start. I ordered the mac n cheese sandwich with a chocolatey stout (by recommendation, I forget the name...oops? It was definitely to my taste though!) and both were satisfactory. A burger was also ordered at the table - satisfactory, nothing excessively surprising, not much to write home about.The mac n cheese was great while it was warm - added substance to a grilled cheese to make it a meal. I wish it had come warmer because once it cooled the pasta began to harden and the cheese solidified. Aside that, a solid meal.Having gone in with no expectations, I was pleasantly surprised. Their beer list is comprehensive and will satisfy many palates, and their food turned out to be better than expected. If I'm in the area looking for a late night meal, will definitely consider a return visit.",3.0,3.0,289,2017-03-08,43.645232,-79.383897,"Sports Bars , Gastropubs , Canadian (New)"

My bartender said that she ordered it that way all the time. Good sign, right? Well... the bread was cold (maybe it had been frozen) and was way too thick for the fillings. While the avocado was plentiful, the brie was very skimpy. I ended up eating the veg & brie and abandoning the blah bread.

Maison Close 1888,"Tucked away little gem at the Dundas end of Kensington Market - can be hard to find as it's basically a house. Just remember to look for the more flashy ""last temptation"" bar sign directly across the street.The space inside is not huge, so caution when trying to bring large groups here. Probably better suited for dates or happy hour. The entire restaurant feels like you've entered someone's house and for the most part isn't too loud with background music and fluctuations in customer flow. Tip: Wednesdays they have their $5 drinks + food menu!!! Do check it out because normally, while the menu is reasonably priced, drinks for example are $10. The food portions are quite small, very tapas style, so don't come too hungry or be prepared to order at least 2-3 dishes per person. They have a number of vegetarian options here and one of the owners will make veggie tacos off-menu if you ask. I had the crab cakes, veggie tacos with red wine last night. The crab cakes came on a bed of white plants (I don't know what it was... Perhaps fennel?) and that had such a crunchy yet chewy texture.Friendly, personable service here - family-owned and run. The wife cooks up the dishes while the husband bartends and does a splendid job at it.

The presentation was pretty, with a flower to add a touch of colour! There was a slice of pork belly to top it off (which was delicious btw). Tbh I was expecting more spice on the meat itself as the menu said ""spicy"" on it, but still yummy nonetheless. The noodles were okay, but I prefer softer noodles. It almost reminded of the instant ramen I use at home for stir fry. Lastly, the broth was really good! I found that it was pretty rich in flavour, which I very much enjoyed.

Sansotei,"I always tell people that ramen is a pretty personalized experience, and for me personally, Sansotei is the best there is in Toronto. This particular location is nice because it doesn't get as busy as the location over in Dundas but these days I do feel like it's gaining traction, and I'm starting to wait longer and longer to get a table. The wait is definitely worth it for me though.When I say ramen is a personalized experience, what I mean is that each person has their own preference for how they like their ramen. Some prefer the noodles to be more chewy, the broth to be more salty, the flavour to be more meaty and so on, but I prefer my ramen to be less salty and less chewy - so compared to Kinton or Santouka, the ramen here is on the lighter side. It's nice to not be dehydrated for the rest of the day after a bowl of ramen.It also surprises me that their gyoza is actually the best I've had in Toronto. They look so small and meh but they taste much much better. The flavour just explodes in your mouth the instant you bite into it, and just writing this review makes me want to hop over and grab a plate of gyoza... which I will likely do. I've also ordered their Zangi, which is basically Karaage, which was just alright. Definitely had better elsewhere.Service here is friendly and efficient, and the food comes out quite quickly, as they should at a ramen joint. Sometimes you will have to be seated next to strangers if the place gets busy, and while that is commonplace in Asia, I find some people can get uncomfortable with that over here for some reason. You can of course request for your own table but you may have to wait a bit longer. Thankfully, people typically don't take a long time eating ramen, so the wait usually won't be too long.But the star of a ramen restaurant should be the ramen, and the ramen here definitely shines the brightest imo over here in Toronto. I frequent this place quite often to the point I sometimes get a bit embarrassed when the servers recognize me, but the stomach wants what it wants.

Sansotei,"On a dreary, rainy Thursday what better way is there to chase away the blues than with a nice steamy bowl of ramen! Sansotei has a good selection of ramens (lacking in vegetarian options however) that are priced right and taste delicious. We ordered goyuza and seaweed salad, both tasty additions to the meal. Friendly and efficient staff and although we went at prime time lunch hours we got a table no problem (although we were asked to share it with a solo diner which was a-ok by me!)Would definitely return if I'm in the neighborhood again!",4.0,4.0,212,2017-05-25,43.666819,-79.385469,"Ramen , Noodles"
Sansotei,"This is a great ramen spot. Been to both locations now and very consistent across the board. The presentation here is really elegant - both the room decoration and food presentation. My black miso came with a nicely placed edible flower on the side - great touch. Seaweed salad is a healthy portion - a lot of places cheap out on that. And the Gyoza is a lot less heavy than at other places.I think this would be a 5 star to a lot of people, but I like creamier broth, so a bit light for me.

Sansotei,"Sansotei is arguably one of the best places to grab a bowl of Ramen if you're ever craving a meal that is salty, savoury and satisfying.Whenever I come here, there is often a line-up that I need to be in before I get seated. This usually lasts about twenty minutes or so, but since this place has such a distinct taste that makes me want to come back for more, I do not mind the wait at all.The bowl is a great portion, with the option to add in extra noodles and other toppings for a small price. I have a friend who always asks for additional noodles in his soup and you can definitely tell the difference between a normal portion and an additional serving. The consistency at this location is great and I know I can reliably come back to this same place over and over again and not be disappointed. The décor and washrooms are all well maintained and it feels very cozy, despite the limited tables. The service at this location is great as well, with the waiters constantly coming back and giving refills on water.Overall, this is a great place to grab a bowl if you're OK with the wait.

Sansotei,"I knew coming to Toronto, there would be a Chinatown and I knew Ramen would have to be on my list of ""to eat."" I looked up noodle places on Yelp to point me in the right direction and it led me straight to Sansotei! It is a small Ramen shop tucked away in a line of stores right off a main drag. It's a very small space, so I can see how this place gets really busy and there might be somewhat of a wait. Luckily, we came right before the rush and was seated immediately. We started out with green tea, an order of gyoza and I ordered the Black Miso Ramen with extra pork belly and egg and the friend ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen. He has actually never had ramen so I ordered what I thought he would like, and when I looked up from my bowl, he had devoured it! The broth was so delicious...It was one of the best things I ate on my trip to Canada, besides the awesome dim sum place down the street.

The black garlic oil add-on is highly recommended and is my default goto every time I eat hereI find sansotei at this location (Yonge st) to be better than the first location on Dundas street, based on the thickness of the cha siu, and also the flavour of the broth (slightly richer tasting IMO)The new-ish miso black ramen with spicy kakuni is also quite delicious, a few bucks more but worth every penny.",4.0,5.0,212,2017-02-12,43.666819,-79.385469,"Ramen , Noodles"
Sansotei,"Wanted something warm and comforting, and decided on Ramen.  Did a bit of searching on Yelp and there is was.  Sansotei, just a few blocks from my hotel.  Walked in and even though it was after 8p on a Wednesday, there were people waiting for tables.  There were 2 sets of couples in front of me, and I think I waited a grand total of 7 mins before a table became available for me.  Was lead to a table (table for 4 even though I was by myself), and was given a menu.  I had thought there would be more on the menu, but no it was very small and limited. I was seated at a table that was near the back and it's where all the servers entered the orders.  I noticed they were all speaking Japanese to each other.  A very good sign.  I decided on the Tonkatsu Black.  I waited for less than 5 mins and my bowl of Ramen-ee-goodness was placed in front of me.  I was very hungry and it smelled so good that I almost forgot to take a photo of it.  Great broth, perfectly cooked noodles, and hot and steaming. After nearly inhaling the ramen, I thanked my server (in Japanese of course) and paid my bill.Overall, Staff were very nice and very attentive.  The ramen was top notch... unlike many other ramen places, where the broth is overly salted, Sansotei has a great broth.  Noodles were perfectly cooked too.  Grand total for bill $12 !  (excl tip).  Yup that's it !  I think I've just found my new ramen goto place !",4.0,5.0,212,2017-02-22,43.666819,-79.385469,"Ramen , Noodles"
Sansotei,"I prefer coming to this Sansotei location as opposed to the one near Dundas/Bay because the lineup is significantly shorter and many times no lines at all. The quality of the food and the seating arrangement is about the same as the other location downtown. Usually customers are here for their ramen bowls, which is what Sansotei is known for. I like getting their Tonkotsu Black (roasted garlic oil) with thick noodle. You get 2 pieces of Chashu, some black fungus, an egg, and some green onions in the bowl. The soup is delicious and the noodles are chewy. The prices are around $10 per ramen bowl. There are also sides available, such as chicken wings, gyoza (fried dumplings), gyu don (beef on rice), and zangi (fried chicken bits). Typically the prices are between $4.50-$5.50. Personally I don't think the sides are worth it for the price given how small the portions are. However, if you're not craving for a large meal and just want something small, I suggest getting the Gyu Don.For dessert, they recently introduced a mille crepe cake, which I have yet to try. I did try the green tea cheese cake before and it was really good, it was soft and creamy and with just enough matcha flavour.",4.0,4.0,212,2017-01-10,43.666819,-79.385469,"Ramen , Noodles"

Of course, you can add a few extra slices of pork for a small fee.There is an option to choose thick or thin noodles, but they all seemed pretty thin to me.Broth is great. Noodles also have a lot of flavour from sitting in the broth.I can see why so many people would be willing to stand outside for a spot.",4.0,4.0,212,2016-12-21,43.666819,-79.385469,"Ramen , Noodles"
Campechano Taquería,"I was a little apprehensive because I love tacos SO much and didn't want to get my hopes up. Thankfully Campechano is awesome. The restaurant is nice and cozy with super loud music that didn't irritate me for some reason and only accepts cash and debit.The earliest reservation I could make online was for 9:45 pm on a Saturday and we were out of there in 35 minutes! I would recommend making a reservation as they were a lot of people waiting for tables on our way out.The food came out as it was prepared and they timed it perfectly so my husband and I each had a plate in front of us. The tacos were just so good - juicy meat, perfectly seasoned sauces, the right amount of messiness. I'm so in love with these tacos.My ranking from what I tried this visit: beef cheek (juicy and flavourful), campechano (I love chicharon), pescado (perfectly deep fried fish, salty sauces) and the sope without meat (kind of whatever except for the nice soft, doughy base). My husband said the barbacoa was his favourite but he didn't order the beef cheek so what does he know? :PWe ordered two cocktails - pina mojito and spicy margarita - and then shared them because each was good and went well with some tacos over others. The pina mojito goes well with the lamb tacos and is as equally refreshing as the spicy margarita (yes, it's SPICY).With two cocktails, seven tacos and one sope the bill with tip was around $80.We will definitely come back for a chill date night, small birthday party or to try out the patio in the summer.",4.0,5.0,104,2017-11-06,43.645696,-79.4006,Mexican

Campechano Taquería,"I grew up in Nova Scotia, so my love of affair with real tacos has been a slow burn. I still sometimes ask for sour cream, embarrassing my Californian husband, I still sometimes wish ground beef was the norm and I still think mole sauce is pretty silly. However, slowly but surely, I've come to appreciate a good taco, and the goods at Campechano Taqueria are great. I popped in for lunch with 3.5 friends and we snagged a lovely table at the back. This place gets pretty pretttty busy at lunch and dinner, but I still felt like we had our own personal space. I was feeling bold, and told the server to bring me three of his favourite tacos. He #blessed me with a pork, fish and finally steak. The pork was my favourite. So saucy and salty, with hints of spice and lime. Delicious. Next time I'm going to order two of those bad boys and try the shrimp. My friend Kent P was positively giddy about his damn shrimp taco.",4.0,5.0,104,2017-08-17,43.645696,-79.4006,Mexican
Campechano Taquería,"Went here for a friends birthday, the atmosphere is very cozy and the waiters are friendly. I've had many fish tacos in my life and their fish tacos (pescado tacos) are definitely on my top 3 list. The fish taco had the right amount of zest, crunch and flavour. They serve one taco to you at a time to ensure each taco is warm before eating. I did also try the portobello mushroom taco, not my favourite but an interesting flavour. The dessert was also very good, we had the tres leches a vanilla cake soaked in milk - sooo delicious! Would highly recommend if you're into tacos and want to try another restaurant. I don't eat meat but many of my friends really liked the al pastor taco (meat taco) as well!",4.0,4.0,104,2018-01-07,43.645696,-79.4006,Mexican
Campechano Taquería,"Came for all the positive reviews on yelp but this place didn't really impress me.First, their service is not bad but definitely lack of organization skills. We called the place at 5:30 or 6 pm, see if it's possible to make a reservation at 7pm. But we were told that the place gets really busy on a Thursday night, so they didn't let us make a reservation until 8:45 pm and surely that's so late for a dinner! So me and my friend decided to show up at 7:30 anyways, if we couldn't get a table we would dinning in elsewhere. So we arrived the place at roughly 7:40, the dinning area (inside) was completely empty, and even the patio only has like 5 tables (two persons per table, so I0 customers?). I would not call this busy but perhaps they have a different definition in terms of busy. The atmosphere though, is lovely. when you walked into the restaurant you would see most of the wall has hand paintings on. I found this pretty attractive. And sure this place would be a great spot to hang out and grab a drink. It's nice weather so we sat at the patio, and between the two of us we had 5 tacos, two drinks and a guacamole to share. Their taco is average size and you probably would need 2-3 tacos to make enough for a meal. Let's start with the guacamole ($8). I think it's a little pricy but I like how they had pomegranate seed in it, love that touch of sweetness. I found the chips thou, is a little too hard, but it's free to refill!! And I do end up liking the guacamole more than the tacos they served. They only serve corn tortillas shell. And they only served two tacos at a time (one for each of us) so the table wouldn't be filled with plates as the tables there are tiny. We had Bistec (sirloin), Carnitas (pork shoulder), Barbacoa (braised lamb), Camarones (shrimps) and Pescado (beer battered branzino, fried fish). I think both Carnitas (pork shoulder) $5 and Barbacoa (braised lamb) $6.5, had the best value and they also tasted the best. Chunks of juicy meat, and the lime juice balanced out the flavour. But the lamb taste is a little plain, need a pint of salt perhaps to kick the fav more. Bistec (sirloin) $7, slightly pricy. With this price I expected there would be a little bit more meat or the meat were not so grounded. They chopped up the meat into very small pieces, but I guess this is how people make authentic Mexican taco? But the most surprising part is, I'm pretty sure I ordered the non spicy  one. But one bite of this taco surely burnt my month and stomach. I admit I have a very low tolerance, but maybe they should warn others that even the non spicy sirloin taco is sort of spicy? Camarones (shrimp) $7, the shrimp didn't came in a whole pieces but they chopped it up into small pieces! And the portion they gave this time was nothing like what the others post on yelp before. I'm sure there is probably only 2.5 -3 small shrimp in the taco. But that's not the worst part, this taco was another fire in the mouth. It was so spicy I couldn't even tastes what's in the taco honestly. They should really adjust the spicy level. Lastly we had the Pescado (beer battered branzino, fried fish) $8. I think $8 is pretty pricey for taco and also because it didn't taste great. The deep fried layer was so hard,  it's almost like chewing fried cardboard. And pink pickle radish on top was super sour! I didn't like this at all. But I guess it was a mistake to order fried fish in a Mexican place, although the taco itself looks gorgeous.I cannot say I'm a big fan of Mexican food or I really know what's authentic Mexican food, but I know next time if I want taco I would go seven lives and or else where. Just because they have better value. But this place for sure it's still a great spot to hang out.",4.0,3.0,104,2017-09-22,43.645696,-79.4006,Mexican
Campechano Taquería,"Great service in a cozy place (too cozy imo) but just not my cup of tea. I have to admit, I don't like corn tortillas even though it's authentic therefore, I didn't really enjoy the tacos or the chips that came with the Guacamole.  Tortilla aside, I didn't find the ingredients to be worthy of the price charged. For example, I ordered grill chicken ($6) expecting chunks of chicken but instead, it came with ground chicken.  It didn't taste as good as I expected but the meat quantity was plenty.  Be careful of the rib eye taco, it's super spicy!!! The guac and portobello mushroom quesadilla were my fav.  As for dessert, there is only one item on the menu, slice of bread soaked in condense/custard milk with pineapple pieces on top. You can skip this and get better dessert else where.",4.0,3.0,104,2017-01-06,43.645696,-79.4006,Mexican
Campechano Taquería,"3.5*. Pretty good! I still prefer Wilbur around the corner, but this place was decent, and is definitely a King West-area spot you should try at least once! We arrived around 6:30 PM on a Friday night and it was very busy. We reserved in advance and we were seated right away. First, ambiance and service. Good, attentive service, but almost to a fault. Our server tried very hard to upsell their menu, even though we clearly tried to tell her we didn't want to order anymore. Ambiance was casual, lively, with a very neighborhood/community feel to it - some tables are pretty close together, so it makes for a nice intimate environment. Second, the food. We ordered Guacamole ($6.00) to start, and 3 tacos (Tinga De Pollo ($4.75), Bistec ($4.75), and the Campechano ($5.00)). Overall, pretty good but not the best. We've definitely had better guacamole elsewhere - it lacked flavour and value to portion size wasn't the best. The tacos were decent and portion size was fine - our favourite was the Bistec. Good flavour, but not the best tacos we've had.Overall, a good spot for a nice casual dinner out - the place was full of families, couples, and groups of friends.

Campechano Taquería,"I struggled to write this review because half the experience was great, the other half poor.  Okay, let's start with the good stuff:- Arrived at 8:30pm on a Saturday night and we were seated immediately. If you frequent this neighbourhood, you know that's a miracle because you're usually waiting way too long for a table on the weekend.- Menu is simple and straightforward - they do tacos and they do them well. - Service - excellent, professional, friendly from start to finish- The lamb and shrimp tacos were phenomenal. The shrimp taco was tangy and spicy - SO GOOD.Now the not-so-good:- By 8:30pm they were out of a few menu items which put a big damper on things. There's nothing sadder than getting excited about food only to be told you can't have it, especially if it's dessert.- Guac was delish, but it was served in the tiniest of bowls for $6 - boo- Very limited cocktail menu, it was a little disappointing.I wouldn't discourage you from trying this spot - I enjoyed the tacos very much and the price point is pretty much on par with other restaurants.",4.0,3.0,104,2016-11-01,43.645696,-79.4006,Mexican
Campechano Taquería,"LOVE LOVE LOVE. Campechano is a hip Mexican sit down restaurant that serves a selection of tacos. I got the Carnitas and Tinga de Pollo for $5 each and we also shared guacamole ($7) with the complimentary chips appetizer.Campechano Taqueria appears very modest from the outside, and it's fairly easy to miss it, but definitely a place to try for locals. I came here during lunch and although there's not many spots to sit, I didn't see anyone needing to wait at the doors. Sometimes, you may be seated at large picnic tables, of which, you may have the chance to share this with another party. The environment is hip, with fiesta music, casual and lively. If you don't have space to put your coats, they have coat hangers located next to your seats, so you won't have to worry about needing to hold your stuff while you're enjoying your tacos. The chips came in a cute blue mug and there was a ton of non-salty but seasoned guac on the side. The tacos are slightly spicy, but down-diggity delicious. A soft shelled taco wrapped with meat, veggies and drizzled in delicious sauce. The sauce is rather viscous, so for the most part, this was one of the cleanest tacos I've ever had. I highly recommend the Carnitas. The Tina de Pollo wasn't a favourite of mine, but it was still delicious! I recommend ordering two tacos without the guac, or just one taco with the guac because it can get super filling!!",4.0,5.0,104,2017-04-10,43.645696,-79.4006,Mexican
Campechano Taquería,"I have to start by saying the tacos here are pretty darn good. Maybe some of the best I've had in the city so far. They do justice to the tortilla which can sadly be overlooked elsewhere. But... damn are they on the pricey side. Ranging from $5 - $7.50 I think you would need at least 3 to make a meal. I had two at lunch, plus sharing a guacamole with my lunching companions and I wasn't exactly 'too full'. The Carnitas was really good and the Barbacoa (braised Lamb) was pretty good as well (if not a touch on the salty side). Since when has the humble taco been turned into a luxury food? The service was good and the place is nicely appointed (maybe a little too nicely). But I have to say - please stop serving your beer pints in enamel tins cups! Maybe it looks cool (it doesn't), but every sip of beer is going to have a 'tin' taste to it. I will be back, but I have to save up some money first (and I'll bring my own beer glass).",4.0,3.0,104,2017-06-16,43.645696,-79.4006,Mexican
Campechano Taquería,"Wanted to try this place for awhile. My friends and I decided to check it out one Friday. It gets busy so definitely recommend making reservations! What can I say about this place? Love the atmosphere for sure. It smells good in the restaurant too. Even the washrooms were super cute and clean. They had candles lit on the tables and in the washroom which for some reason made everything seem better?Anyways onto the food and drinks. Friends and I shared sangria, good typical sangria. I also tried the pineapple mojito I think it was, and it was so good! Our table ordered about 2-3 tacos each. I'd say for myself 3 was good enough. We also shared the ceviche appetizer. I would have to say the tinga was so good, the chipotle shrimp, and I also had one of the beef ones which I can't remember but they made it mild for us. Some of them were still spicy but it had a good kick. They are a bit on the salty side though. Will definitely be back. Really enjoyed our dinner. Saw some big groups there so I'd recommend for a large party! Ps. They also have a patio but didn't get to see how big or nice it was.",4.0,5.0,104,2016-10-16,43.645696,-79.4006,Mexican
Campechano Taquería,I visited Campechano on a warm friday night on the first day of fall so i was able to sit on the patio.  We ordered the guacamole to share.  It was a small portion.  It needed some lime juice and i would have liked some cilantro.  Its served with heavily salted house made tortilla chips.  I also ordered the carnita tacos which was pretty much just shredded pork.  Also heavily salted but the flavour wasnt too bad.  I then tried the camarones tacos.  Chipotle coated cut up shrimp with pineapple.  Again a bit too salted for me.  The menu is limited to ceviche and tacos mostly.  For my taste it was heavily salted but i suppose when you are drinking beer it goes down better.  I had grapefruit soda to balance it.  Its a very out of patio in between King and Queen St,4.0,3.0,104,2017-09-24,43.645696,-79.4006,Mexican

Not a lot of choice but wait...these tacos rock!  There's heat but not quite too much. You will need to order two. I recommend the Tinga de Pollo (shredded chicken on flour) and Pescado (lightly fried sea bass on corn) plus the guacamole and salsa platter. There are other hipster places.

Every single taco I've tried has been flavourful and delicious. My all time favourite taco is Carnitas, and at Campechano, they have a good one, just happens to be a bit too salty. If the chefs are reading this, please tone the salt down by 1/3, you'll have one of the best Carnitas taco in the country if you do! Having said that though, the lamb leg taco was amazing. With the Pescado, you can't go wrong. So far every taco I've tried has been yummy!

Pow Wow Cafe,"My girlfriend and I had brunch at the Pow Wow Café on a chilly Saturday afternoon. The vibe is extremely cozy and casual, with the kitchen centrally placed and wide open to the five or so tables in front of the window. There is apparently another dining room in the back but I did not see it. There is a reasonably roomy patio in front but at -15C that was not an option today.I was seated right beside the chef/owner and enjoyed watching him gracefully and rhythmically prepare our food and that of the tables who ordered just before us. And when our food arrived it did not disappoint. My girlfriend had the poached eggs with smoked salmon which she rated 5/5. I had the brunch platter including duck bacon, venison and a little smoked cheddar omelette, which I also graded a 5/5. In fact my plate was so close to the chef that just after it was placed in front of me and before I had dug in, he piroutted, and without taking a step, and expertly dropped my little venison burger onto my plate in just the right spot from his spatula, mentioning that he had missed before the waitress had grabbed it. Both our plates came with ample portions of really really good, moist, homefries and exotic greenery with a zesty dressing and nice touches like flower petals and julienned veggies of what type I cannot recall. Neither of us could finish our portions, but note well that the fried bread which appears to be a focus for a lot of the menu did not go unfinished on either of our plates. Oh and a fresh fruit medley of blueberries, pineapple, honeydew melon and grapefruit. It was a feast. Somewhere in the description of the plates needs to include the word ""flourish"". It could go just about anywhere.The staff were jovial and numerous, gathered in the kitchen eating takeout from McDonalds, a deliciously ironic juxtaposition to the wholesome and earthy food they were making for the rest of us. Even funnier, they washed it down with a communal birthday toast of organic ginger juice. Then it got better again - a customer asked them whose birthday it was and one of them replied that it was none of theirs, but it must be someone's birthday. There were about six of them crammed into the little kitchen area and honestly I would not be surprised if a couple of them were not actually working but came in to hang out on their day off because they enjoyed being there with their chums. But their camaraderie in no way interfered with the attentive service as I have seen it do in other such instances.We are both looking forward to going back to try a few things from the dinner menu!",4.0,5.0,49,2018-01-06,43.654171,-79.401556,"Canadian (New) , Cafes"
Pow Wow Cafe,"Came here for a late 2pm brunch on a Sunday. The patio looks lovely for the summer and the inside is only about 6 tables of 2 in the front but I believe there is more seating at the back. But the front where we were seated was nice, lots of window that let in a lot of sun. The server was friendly and nice. The interior was not the nicest, it felt like someone's cabin kitchen with a bit of college apartment mixed in, it felt a bit old and not super clean, I was seated by the window and by the window frame and edges was a build up of dirt and grime. But the open kitchen is nice where you get to see the food being made. I got the eggs Benny on the fry bread with smoked salmon and goat cheese sauce ($15). The portions are huge here, literally a mountain! 2 perfectly runny eggs and the sauce was creamy - super good. The best part is the bread - so crispy and savory! With peppery home fries, a mountain of salad with pretty flowers on top and a good serving of fruit - you will not leave hungry! I also got the cedar soda, which was odd at first because it tastes like a forest but the more you drink the better it really gets!",4.0,4.0,49,2018-01-12,43.654171,-79.401556,"Canadian (New) , Cafes"

Pow Wow Cafe,AMAZING! My friend and I went here after hearing so many posiitve reviews about this place. We went around lunch time on a Thursday so the brunch menu was available. We decided to share the coconut chicken curry taco and the brunch plate. They both were very massive and deliciousThe presentation of the taco was atypical. The frybread served as the taco shell and was plated at the bottom and then piled on the chicken curry which had big chunks of lean chicken meat. The curry flavour was well seasoned - not too overpowering but enough to taste the flavour. Heaps of sourcream and veggies to top off the dishThe Powwow brunch platter was succulent. My favourite were the frybread and the scrambled eggs. The bread was crunchy with a soft interior and so tasteful unlike most bread. The eggs were buttery and soft and had an earthy flavour to it. I also enjoyed the venison sausage patty - wish they cake with 2 instead. Anything on the brunch menu comes with a salad and fruits.I also got the cedar tonic which had a oaky taste which surprisingly was fresh compared to the flavourful dishes,4.0,5.0,49,2017-12-29,43.654171,-79.401556,"Canadian (New) , Cafes"
Pow Wow Cafe,"Came here with a friend for dinner after hearing a number of positive reviews on this place.  The menu consisted of about 3 or 4 apps, and four different types of tacos.  We shared the fried smoked fish croquettes and a chicken curry taco.We really didn't know what to expect.  The croquettes are made with the fish of the day, and ours was made with pickerel.  Seriously, it was SO GOOD! The exterior was nicely fried, and the inside was soft and mush with the consistency of mashed potatoes.  It came on a bed of salad and aioli. If I wasn't saving my appetite for the taco, I would have ordered another plate.As we waited for our taco, we looked around to see what this taco looked like.  It looked like a huge mound of food topped with salad and some petals.  For $12, we didn't know if it was one taco or multiple tacos.  To our surprise, it seemed more like a deconstructed taco with a piece of fried bread underneath. Even though we were sharing our meal, I really did not want to share the fried bread. I would highly recommend this cash-only establishment, and will definitely be coming back to try brunch!",4.0,5.0,49,2017-11-10,43.654171,-79.401556,"Canadian (New) , Cafes"

I ordered the trout special with frybread, smoked trout, and goat cheese cream with a side of salad and peppery home potatoes.

The frybred bread was crispy on the outside with fluffy insides and the goat cheese cream could've been served by the glass. I would also the describe the frittata as fluffy. It got me a little jealous. It's very tiny inside, but the patio will sit a decent amount of people for warmer months.

Pow Wow Cafe,"Holy pow! It has become a habit to check out places to eat in Kensington when I'm here for a cheap haircut--a usual excuse to investigate a new shop bringing a hip twist to indigenous foods. The whole 'Indian tacos' thing is one thing, but visiting on a weekend I sure wasn't expecting brunch grub at the humble Pow Wow Cafe. The poached eggs dish ($15) was big and amazing--along with a salad, smoked salmon, goat cheese and fluffy Ojibway frybread (bannock), it is a well-balanced medley.There is a small back eating area, though if you can score a table at the front, it's much nicer and you get to see chef Shawn Adler at work in the tiny kitchen. The whole vibe is welcoming and unpretentious, and fits in well with the rest of the Market scene.Cash only. Also the cedar soda. Definitely try the cedar soda.

Pow Wow Cafe,"Top marks for this little joint in Kensington Market. On a street filled with unlimited options for dining - Pow Wow Cafe is carving out a big footprint with its big flavours, portions and service. Hours are a bit odd though - so check date and time before visiting.ATMOSPHERE: This little shop is filled with warm and friendly staff. Super chill and cool vibe. There's very little seating (as typical for Kensington), but there is a cute little patio out front.SERVICE: Wonderful! From initial welcome to goodbyes - they genuinely care about their food & you!PRICE: With the generous portions, I'd say it's well worth every penny, nickel, and dime.FOOD: Fantastic! A delicious mix of indigenous (Ojibwe) and mexican food. Thus far, I've had the Venison & Fiddleheads taco (it was that day's special), and the Smoked Pork taco (off the regular menu). Both were delicious. The bannock (or ""Indian frybread/taco"") used as the taco base is phenomenal in texture!

The super friendly chef will explain the food and that day there was a duck confit, and there was also an enticing brunch menu.  The cedar soda was a bit subtle for my sweetaholic palate.

Pow Wow Cafe,"Amazing Amazing Amazing!!! Their pulled pork tacos are to die for - huge portions with really fresh ingredients. They have an open kitchen and you can see the chef freshly preparing your food. There were four taco options - jerk chicken, pulled pork, vegetable chilli, and one another option. It was my first experience with Aboriginal cuisine but I absolutely loved it. Very small and quaint cafe feel, all the tables indoor and outdoor were occupied on a warm Wednesday evening. I sat right in front of the open kitchen, the chef was welcoming and very curious to know if we enjoyed the food. You can tell he was passionate about the food and truly wanted you to get an amazing experience. Service was lovely - the hostess/waitress was attentive and ensured our waters were always topped up due to the heat of the kitchen. There is only one chef that makes the tacos so it does take a while for your food to come if it's a full house. If you're seated inside, it does get quite warm because of the open stove! CASH ONLY.

I was looking forward to the brunch menu after reading the rave reviews about it, but found out they only served it between 11am-3pm daily. The other menu was tacos, but not just normal tacos, they were mountainous. Mega-tacos, which were totally fine too.I came a bit earlier and waited for my friends. The server was really nice, came to chat, and served me water promptly. After my friends arrived, we were greeted warmly by the server once more with the dinner menu. We ordered and a couple minutes later, I was told by the server they did not have the Vegetarian Tacos for the day.Instead, the server offered to serve anything from the brunch menu. At the end of the meal, she only charged me for what the Veggie Taco would of been! It was honestly so nice of her and the staff, and they really did not have to. I got the 2 poached eggs served over their special frybread with salmon and goat cheese sauce (sauce!!!). It was savory, filling, and the best hangover food, even if you don't have a hangover. My friends got the Jerk Chicken Taco. The mega-tacos are very flavorful, colourful, and super instagram-worthy. Some of the best staff I've experienced in Toronto.

Uncle Smoke Cookhouse,"Very good wings, but I feel like they shortchange you.When I went to pick up my ""two pound"" to-go bag, I yanked it up into the air because I know what two pounds of wings should feel like. I don't believe they actually put a pound of meat in the fryer when you order a pound of wings. According to a paper called ""Cost and yield of ready-to-eat chicken products"" published by the University of Texas Agricultural Extension, a pound of raw chicken drumsticks shrink down 23% by weight when deep fried. Wings shrink 20%. They're between a third and a half bone, after all, so there isn't that much moisture to sizzle away in the first place. 78% of 2 pounds is 25 ounces. Uncle Smoke served waaay less, only 18.3 ounces, according to my new Amazon Basics kitchen scale. Even with smoking taking out another ounce of water, I think they're shorting customers by about 25%, give or take. Starbucks lost a class action lawsuit for under filling cups by a lot less than that.So I give this place five stars for flavor, as the wings are actually friggin' delicious, but only two stars for honesty in marketing.

August 8,"Quality AYCE sushi and dim sum, with an iPad ordering system and fast and attentive service. I visited this location on a late Sunday afternoon, and was seated right away. Luckily the lunch AYCE menu ran until about 3:30pm.4/5 - Venue5/5 - Food4/5 - OverallVenue: The location is clean and well kept, with obvious signs of renovation, just don't expect a modern or high end experience. The seating is spacious, with booth seats and tables alike. There is also a small bar available, with a selection of Canadian classics, and imports like various sakes or Chinese beers. The only downside is that the tile floors really pool up the winter snow and slush, and can lead to a pretty dirty floor.Food: The sushi here will NOT disappoint. The fish is fresh, and an obvious step up from your typical AYCE sushi joint. The salmon is buttery and tender, and the butterfish is very smooth as well. None of the tough fish that you can sometimes get at AYCE sushi. The dim sum is not bad as well, though I do suspect that not everything is fresh or made in-house. The tempura is light and crisp, and the sushi rolls are well made, and presentation is not poor. Come for the fish, it's worth it.Overall: One unique aspect is that the ordering system is through an iPad, so there's no need to flag down a waiter, or to repeat a long list of items to them. All our food that was ordered arrived in a timely fashion, though I expect times to be slower during peak hours. The waiter was very accommodating for our vegan friend, and the kitchen happily accepted sushi that incorrectly had mayo in it, and remade it to order. Great service for an AYCE restaurant, and great value at about $22 for lunch.",3.0,4.0,10,2018-01-19,43.654614,-79.398629,"Japanese , Chinese , Sushi Bars"
August 8,"Give this place a chance. Honestly I've always been skeptical about AYCE sushi- how can a business sustain itself and provide good sushi when it's all you can eat? Costs must be cut somewhere right? So when I heard about dim sum AND sushi, I was even more skeptical. But then I read the reviews here and figured it was worth a shot - especially since my cravings for AYCE was pretty strong.  Upon walking into the place, I already got good vibes- but of course, a nice place doesn't mean good food. It was only until the sushi was brought to our table that I was sold. The sushi was fresh and very similar to the pictures on the iPad. There was a wide enough selection of nigari, teppanyaki, hand rolls, special rolls, etc. that I think there is something for everyone. In terms of the dim sum, everything was to standard. Nothing amazing but nothing disappointing- except maybe the custard bun. I'm not convinced they make the dim sum in-house because it looked and tasted very frozen fresh, if you know what I mean.The iPad made things very quick. From placing an order to eating it took no more than 5-10 min. Waiters were also fast to collect plates and even gave a tutorial on how to order from the iPad. Granted, I also visited with my boyfriend on a Monday during lunch so it wasn't busy at all. A few logistics- sashimi is only available in the evening. However, they do allow you to have sashimi in your AYCE for lunch- you just have to pay the dinner price. For $18.99, I definitely would come back, but I can't justify paying $29.99 for dinner (even with sashimi). Would I come again? Probably. But only under specific circumstances- the $18.99 deal for lunch on Monday-Thursday. So I guess you could say I enjoyed the experience, but didn't love it.",3.0,4.0,10,2018-01-16,43.654614,-79.398629,"Japanese , Chinese , Sushi Bars"
August 8,"Great service, great vibes, great food!With the fusion of sushi and dim sum in one place, August 8 is one of the most unique and best all you can eat sushi places to go to. Like many other locations, orders are all done through an iPad placed on the table. The sushi came out fairly quick, but the dim sum dishes took a bit longer to come. The presentation was splendid and the sizes of the rolls were perfect. They offered four ice cream flavours: mango, green tea, vanilla, and chocolate. The mango had a very fresh taste to it, very similar to a mango slushie. Their dessert menu wasn't as limited as other places. Overall, great place and I will definitely come back in the future!",3.0,5.0,10,2018-01-13,43.654614,-79.398629,"Japanese , Chinese , Sushi Bars"

August 8,"Came for late lunch on a Saturday and i instantly regretted for choosing this over Rol San. I must say this place is an ayce sushi disguised as ayce dimsum because the choices for dimsum is very limited. Came in and no one assist us until 15 mins later a server came and asked ""oh no one gave you water?"" 20 mins after ordering, the first 4 pieces of salmon and tuna sushi came out with a bowl of Udon soup despite the fact that we ordered dimsum once we seated ourselves. The udon soup was actually decent and chewy udon noodle texture. Sushi quality is expected at any other ayce sushi. We asked 3 servers in total to go check on our order and no one came with a proper explanation. So i asked them to get us the bill and willing to pay for what we ate which is 10 pieces of sushi and and tiny Udon bowl which came up to $21 after tax. I was so hungry and dissapointed so i didnt check the bill. But even more upset when supervisor/manager gave us the bill without saying sorry or explain but simply told us that he knew about the situation so we only charged by this amount.",3.0,1.0,10,2018-01-27,43.654614,-79.398629,"Japanese , Chinese , Sushi Bars"

Kaiseki Yu-zen Hashimoto,"Having wanting to try this for ages, we decided to bite the bullet and do it as part of my boyfriend's Christmas present.  And boy, were we in for an experience.  First off, you dined in a pretty private room mainly because they only serve 3 tables a night, staggered.  Our service was led by Kei Hashimoto who was courteous, professional, and extremely knowledgeable.  Every single course was mind blowing and flavours danced in your mouth in every possible way.  Kei explained every single course in great detail discussing what exactly the ingredients were and where they were sourced from.  A lot of our foods were imported from Japan.  Two of my favourite courses were the wagyu course and the dessert, where we got THE melon.  At the end of our meal, Kei asked us if we had time to join the tea ceremony.  We were led into a separate tea room and given a glimpse of how sacred a tea ceremony could be.  It was serene, peaceful, and enlightening.  Kaiseki Yu Zen Hashimoto is definitely not an everyday place to go to but if you have that special occasion, it is definitely worth the visit.  We will definitely be back because at $800, it was a way better experience than Nobu (see my Nobu HK review).",4.0,5.0,19,2018-01-17,43.726436,-79.334899,Japanese

Kaiseki Yu-zen Hashimoto,"I am confident when I say this place is hands down the most authentic Kaiseki cuisine I've ever been to in Toronto (thus far). The experience takes you back to Japan - from the moment you walk in, the intricate decor and personable service, it felt like they were trying to take you through a journey. The assistant Manager, Kei, was a pleasure to talk to. He was friendly and extremely knowledgeable about every question we asked him. The entire restaurant only had 3 tables and they keep it that way to ensure you have a proper Kaiseki experience in peace and quiet. It was our 7 year anniversary celebration and the on on the table was a personal note written and stamped by the chef. They really pay attention to details when you make the reservations, which are recommended a week in advance. I won't go into detail about the dishes, but $200 per person for the 6-course lunch was well worth it. The quality of all ingredients are top-notch and the effort spent on each dish can be seen in small details like how they tie bean sprouts into a knot, the exquisite plating. Every course was served like it was a piece of art. The miso soup may be my favorite - it does not sink to the bottom like other places, but instead carries a creamy texture and the dab of mustard went surprisingly well with the soup. We had tea ($6) to go with our meal and you are able to get up to 2 refills. The main course was duck breast porridge w/ poached quail egg. We were offered seconds in case we weren't full before dessert was served. The lunch sessions do not come with the tea ceremony, so if you'll have to come during dinner to see it. On our way out, Kei took photos of us by the front door, which would be emailed to us along with photos of our meal today. Since it was Valentine's Day, we each received a fresh rose! The chef came out to say goodbye, walks us all the way out the door and bowed outside in -20 weather! I wanted to usher them back inside because it was freezing, but the Hashimoto family won't let you leave without making you feel like a true VIP. I will definitely be back!",4.0,5.0,19,2016-02-14,43.726436,-79.334899,Japanese

Kaiseki Yu-zen Hashimoto,"The short version of my review is this: ""Hashimoto is hands down my favorite dining experience ever.""It's rare to be able to walk away from a restaurant and say that every course was delightful, and good enough to have stood on its own. I thought this was true of every course at Hashimoto. It's also rare to be able to say that every dining experience at a restaurant is as delightful as the other. This is true of the few times I've gone to Hashimoto over the years as well.Service at Hashimoto is exceptional. I always feel very welcomed when I come here. From the moment I'm greeted at the door, throughout service, and all the way through to the end of the meal and as we're driving off. The chef even comes by to talk with us at the end of the meal, sees us to the door, and then bows to wave good bye as the car pulls away. Every course is well introduced, explained down to the detail of not only why certain ingredients are used, but why the plateware is being used. We were happy to let the restaurant pick the sake to pair, and the chef was the one who make the recommendation. And it sung perfectly with the meal. They also don't have a large number of tables as well. I think in total there's only three. And so while we talked with normal voices, it was not loud at all. There was only one other table/room also used last night. The previous time I was here, it was just us. I rather like that about Hashimoto.This is not a sushi restaurant, so please don't leave thinking ""I didn't get very much sushi."" But if you're interested in a meal where the courses are carefully designed, and they seem very well connected and balanced, then I can't think of a better restaurant to recommend. I don't know how to describe what the meal feels like other than to say that every mouthful brought a smile to my face. The experience is quite different (at least for me) from an ""explosion"" of flavour...but instead it's a very harmonious experience. I'm not going to describe each dish because the menu changes. The ingredients also are flown in from Japan, so it's dependent on the season. There were some elements that I remembered having from the previous time I was here. But there were certainly new ones as well. But everything is very pretty.There is an optional tea ceremony at the end as well. We skipped it this time, but have done it in the past. It is a very nice experience as well.",4.0,5.0,19,2015-11-18,43.726436,-79.334899,Japanese

Kaiseki Yu-zen Hashimoto,"Kaiseki is not about sushi not about sashimi; it is about the beautiful and many years history and stories behind every dish. My fiancé who was my bf at the time took me there for our 2 years anniversary and it was an amazing experience. Every dish and every single piece of ingredients were so delicate and full of heart by the one and only head chef Hashimoto. Even the boxes used had a meaning to it, we got to ask a lot of questions and understand a lot more about the Japanese culture and the true depth meaning of Kaiseki. We made a reservation of course but we were lucky that it was a quiet night therefore we had 1 to 1 service from chef Hashimoto's son. The restaurant atmosphere was very peaceful and had great elements of traditional of Japan. Not to mention, the end of night tea ceremony was also a very nice touch and calming way to end the dinner : )   Thank you for their chef's hand written personal card to us as well us complimentary pictures they looked for us and later on emailed us.

Every detail, from the decor to the cherry blossom trees (not quite in bloom yet) to the friendly service was exquisite. Our host, Kei, was so friendly and explained each dish in detail. It was truly a ""mindful eating"" experience as each dish was a work of art and a flavour journey, with ingredients sourced straight from Japan and seasonally inspired. We enjoyed genmaicha tea with our meal. Another special touch was a hand-written Japanese birthday card from Chef Hashimoto who also came out to visit us at the end.   I highly recommend this incredible culinary experience in Toronto and hope to be back!",4.0,5.0,19,2016-05-01,43.726436,-79.334899,Japanese

Kaiseki Yu-zen Hashimoto,"My date took me here because he wanted to impress me with how much money he has. He said the only people who know of this restaurant are the ones that need to know it. Now I am one of those people and I'll explain why dinner here may not be worth the staggering price. I loved the restaurant's concept. We were seated in an individual room and head server was dressed in a pretty kimono. Ambiance was of traditional Japanese mansion style. The table looked aged with unfinished and plates looked like they belong to museums. $300 9-course meal, which had required 1 week advance reservation, consisted of sushis, soups, cooked fish and many dishes I was not familiar with. They tasted good but for someone like me who doesn't know anything about cooking it seemed like a waste. But exotic ingredients and they way they were combined and cooked were unique. They tasted like nothing I had before. The most memorable thing from the dinner was how those dishes looked. They looked like artworks! Each plate had tiny amount of foods. I know this is normal for tasting menus but the chef's exercise on how little food could be served on each plate was on a different level. Some dishes literally had a couple of bites. What good is good food if I could have only a taste of what it could potentially be in full form? Some dishes felt anticlimactic as I couldn't fully enjoy all the different flavours. But the dishes came out in timely manner. After dinner we opted for tea party on the house in a different room. That was a memorable experience but we had to kneel during the whole time, which hurt my legs. The tea was very bitter. But supposedly it is good for health.After all was said and done dinner came up to more than $1000. With so little food I didn't even feel full. If you're wondering, I kindly refused his offer and paid for my own meal. All in all Kaiseki is a restaurant for those who know their foods and those who can appreciate good foods when they see them. Me dining at this restaurant was like giving an illiterate East of Eden and telling him to read all the pages. If you have too much money and want to feel good about it this restaurant is good for that purpose too.",4.0,3.0,19,2013-01-11,43.726436,-79.334899,Japanese
Kaiseki Yu-zen Hashimoto,"I ate at the Mississauga location three years ago, before they moved.An extraordinary experience; it's not a meal, it's cultural immersion.  I was at a wedding in a cheesy banquet hall in an ugly mall and went out for some air [OK, a ciggie]. Next to an auto detailing shop was a tiny door with a menu posted on it: $225 per person, tasting menu...needless to say I was intrigued. I booked the next day and we ate there two weeks later. Very hard to describe the attention to detail and the quality of the food, but it made Susur's look positively pedestrian. The Wagyu beef literally melted in the mouth and the duck was astonishing. My wife liked the sushi, but I preferred the sashimi. The ingredients are flown in from Japan twice a week.   There were two tables and no distractions until a couple of drunk guys walked in and asked for a beer...then they saw the whole set up and just walked away, no doubt thinking ""WTF?""  If I had the money, I'd eat there once a week.

Restaurant Chantecler,"Charming and intimate spot for high quality cocktails, French dishes, and warm hospitality. This place has easily become one of my top places to dine in Toronto. You should know that I'm incredibly picky. The Good:- The food is spectacular. Since they offer smallish portions, we got to sample about 1/4 of their menu. We ordered the butter shrimp (comes with succulent persimmon), French Onion soup, chicken pate (I will have a memory taste of this one for a while), duck (each half cooked differently for variety), ratatouille side, and cheese puffs. My husband doesn't even like French onion soup, but he ate most of it (boo for me). The people next to us ordered the beer tartare, which looked spectacular. We'll be trying it next time. - Great selection of cocktails, with some creative options. We sat at the bar and got to watch them being prepared. - Service is warm, friendly, not fake (like you find at some other places), and not overbearing (again, like you find at some other places). He chatted us up a bit and chatted up the party sitting next to us. Dining here feels like dining at someone's home. The hospitality is unbeatable.- The menu changes (possibly seasonally), which keeps things fresh and interesting.- Cozy and intimate ambiance. Exposed brick and warm lighting gives the place a bit of warmth. The Bad:I usually never have a hard time finding something to criticize. I actually can't think of anything notable here, so this is going to be a very petty and insignificant criticism.- The selection of side dishes was pretty small. It was like 3 different types of vegetables and french fries. I didn't feel compelled to get any of them, though we did anyways just to try one. Verdict: ABSOLUTELY come here (make a reservation though). Perfect for when you want to wow someone (or yourself).",4.0,5.0,135,2017-11-26,43.641719,-79.431247,"French , Cocktail Bars"

Restaurant Chantecler,"Chantecler is a chic restaurant with modern restaurant bar flair (hipster vibe for sure) and amazing food! Though it's a small space, they were accommodating for our group of 8 a few weeks ago. Yes, it took longer for our food to come but it was understandable for the amount we ordered for our large group and it was a busy Friday night with people coming in nonstop to try to get seats. It's just hard to wait when you're hangry but it was worth it! Tip: make a reservation when there's more than 2 people dining!All of the food we ordered was delicious, photo worthy (we all totally knocked ourselves out with taking photos haha) and great portions for the price considering this is a French place. To start, we ordered a few orders of cheese puffs which were light, airy and had just the right amount of delicious cheese and seasoning on it. A friend ordered the chicken pate which came with some jam and that was also flavourful and delicious.For mains, a few friends shared the duck which they said was really good and not dry. Hubs and I got the steak and marrow, as well as their salmon - both were cooked well and had savoury flavours in each bite. For sides, we also all had several orders of the fries which were so addicting! The polenta and corn side dish was not what we expected when we got it but it was tasty! Drinks were also enjoyed by all. I had the signature gin and grapegruit tonic cocktail which was perfect with all the food we had. A few of us got the same drink and others had beer.

A restaurant that embodies the best of the area,creates very good food at a reasonable price, and keeps you coming back.  Its YOUR neighbourhood restaurant... the only one that stands out for consistent good service and awesome plates.  It's too bad I dont live W Queen W or Parkdale cause I would love this place to be mine!I came on a Sunday evening during the long weekend and we were one of the first ones in the restaurant.  The place isnt big but the front windows completely open up to the streets allowing a lot of gorgeous light and also fresh air into the space.  Theres a lot of tall bar seating and some shared tables & bar space.  It was comfortable enough that we didnt feel like we had to overhear neighbouring tables.  The service here was spot on for a place like this... authentically warm, friendly, helpful, and interested in creating a good experience.  We werent too sure how much to order but were told that one or two platters with a few snacks, sides, and appetizers to fill it out would be more than enough for our small group.  I wondered if it would be enough but I realized quickly that Chantecler reminds me of many of the true Parisian bistros.  It offers really good food at very reasonable prices that fills you up and you leave happy.  It's not like some of the hipster places near Ossington where you wonder where half of the serving went (hello Good Son... 2 loonie sized scallops is not an entree at $25!).  Like I said... Chantecler needs to be in every hood in Toronto... including Ossington.We ordered a fair bit with 2 orders of their own beer and it only came up to $80 before tip!  We did order a fair bit of small things so we can try different things and I highly recommend thatGougeres Cheese Puffs - A cute plate of many little warm airy carby goodness arrives covered with a dusting of Parmesan.  This was a nice opening as who can say no to warm cheesy carbs.  I would have appreciated if it had more of a cheesy flavour. 3.5/5Kale and Roasted Squash Salad - Nicely dressed kale salad that had 2 good sweet roasted slices of squash, pieces of poached sweet pear. Generous shaving of Parmesan to bring salty flavours.  And some pumpkin seeds to bring the crunch.  it's a solid and generous helping for all the adults at the table.  4/5Chicken Pate - Ok, this was soo ridiculously creamy.  A super generous serving of rich buttery chicken liver pate that was accompanied with a sweet tomato jam, crunchy radishes, and tart acidic pickles.  Put everything together and you get a burst of delicious crunchy, smooth, creamy, sweet, sour, and tart.  I cannot tell you how many times we all commented how good this was.  This is enough for 3+ adults to share... easily.  But you probably dont want to even though your doctor would recommend it.  Kudos to the service who did bring a 2nd plate of bread to help use up all the great pate.  5/5Sausage and Pork Platter - This is another dish that completely surprised on how good it can be.  The pork served looks like a loin but it's really the pork shoulder rolled up in a rollade and then pan seared to the point the ends are crispy like a bacon while the interior is a tender bite.  We were all amazed because we expected dry loin with the exterior looking that crisp... totally pleasantly surprised.  Probably one of the best pork I've had this year.  The sausage was ok... a bit dry but the pork shoulder... ORDER IT!  The accompanying apple sauce and grainy mustard are just perfect to give that sour and sweet.  Another winner 5/5Brussel Sprouts with Bacon - I like this a lot ... it has bacon.  I think thats enough to convince anyone to try this.  It's wonderful generous serving for $6 and satisfied the entire table for some green vegetables.  Minor issue would be some of the sprouts were a bit big and not cooked through to tender.  4/5Fries - French fries are done pretty good here.  I think we got this cause we love how someone at the table thought French Fries are French when they were really young.  It could have been cooked a bit crispier as some pieces were still tender and pale instead of crispy.  3.5/5The Pork and Chicken Pate were really well done and the price point makes this an affordable option any day of the week.  I am already looking at the menu to see what other items we can try (duck? fish? marrow?).  The service makes this place a perfect spot where you can feel relaxed and enjoy an amazing dinner.  Parkdale and West Queen West... you're lucky to have this spot!",4.0,4.0,135,2017-07-05,43.641719,-79.431247,"French , Cocktail Bars"
Restaurant Chantecler,"I'd been to Chantecler many years ago and dug the food, but the menu's completely changed in the time since, so I figured I should probably get back in there to see what's what.We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and were shown to a seat at the bar, which, I'll admit, annoyed me at first. I reserved specifically so I *wouldn't* have to sit at the bar, and I never was entirely able to get comfortable sitting there.But as the night wore on, I began to enjoy the novelty of watching the chef and the bartender do their thing.Anyway, the food was pretty great. We ordered:(Some of the items we got aren't on the online menu, so I'll try to describe them as best I can.)Cheese Puffs (""whipped herb butter""): These are interesting, to put it mildly. They're basically like savory profiteroles, and though the dish didn't arrive hot, it's certainly a tasty little appetizer.Chicken Pate (""chicken spread, tomato jam & toast""): This is one of the best pates I've eaten in a while. It's incredibly creamy and super flavorful. (Again there was a temperature issue, though, as it tasted like it had just come out of a refrigerator.)Fried Mushrooms: This dish basically consisted of mushrooms that had been sliced, battered, and deep fried, and it was delicious. This might just have been the highlight of the night.French Onion Soup: A very strong interpretation of the venerable dish. The broth might've been just a little too thin for my liking but the flavors were absolutely on point.Steak in Puff Pastry: This was essentially our main course and it was pretty fantastic. The cook on the steak was nothing short of perfect, and the various sauces that accompanied it were also amazing. I was happy enough to eat the steak by itself, though; it was just that good.And for dessert, we got the Chocolate Eclair. This thing is enormous. It comes with an extremely rich chocolate sauce in the side and is poured over top when it's served. A truly fantastic way to end the meal.I've also got to give a shout-out to the house beer, which is light and refreshing and I could've quaffed about 10 of those things.",4.0,4.0,135,2017-10-17,43.641719,-79.431247,"French , Cocktail Bars"

Restaurant Chantecler,"I'd been wanting to check this place out for awhile. I can definitely say it's a solid spot for dinner. It has a very indie vibe. Comfortable, fun and feels very current. This place has recently reinvented itself into French driven cuisine.Everything I tried had flavour and didn't feel heavy even though it may have looked like I ordered a lot for a little person. I was completely satisfied. I ordered a half stuffed chicken. Tender, juicy and such a nice crispy ski to give it that yummy fat flavour we love, right? I only wish there was more gravy.  The side that came with it was a vinaigrette tossed greens and mushrooms. A perfect pairing. I also ordered the ratatouille.made with zucchini, peppers, eggplant and pesto. Also married well with the chicken. I was impressed. It's been awhile since everything I ordered worked so well.Their signature cocktail is mighty fine. I could drink that puppy for days. It's a gin and grapefruit tonic. I could see why it's their signature. Damn fine mix .Customer service was on point. Really awesome peeps no matter who came to our table. Friendly and open to any questions you might come up with.Definitely going back.",4.0,5.0,135,2016-11-16,43.641719,-79.431247,"French , Cocktail Bars"
Restaurant Chantecler,"I'm definitely closer to a 4.5 on this one. Lots of great aspects of this restaurant in addition to the food, and I enjoyed it so much I descended on it twice in 2 of 3 weekends. The vibe is great, and the service is charmingly informal, but attentive. And let's be honest, who doesn't like share-plates?A couple of must-try's include the cheese puffs, the snails, the duck and their brussel sprouts. The cheese puffs might be the fluffiest food on the planet, the snails are rich, meaty and swimming in butter and the duck is perfectly cooked, flavourful and moist.We also had some experience with the steak and the stuffed chicken. I enjoyed the steak a little more than the chicken, but both paled in comparison to the duck. Another bonus were the well-priced bottles of wine and interesting cocktails. Chantecler has become one of my staples for casual French bistro-inspired food.",4.0,4.0,135,2017-08-01,43.641719,-79.431247,"French , Cocktail Bars"
Restaurant Chantecler,"An intimate and refreshingly trendy restaurant in Parkdale, I avoid using term hipster too loosely but it's actually a great description for this place. Their modern decor, laid back vibes and delectably prepared small plates has added another glowing example of Toronto's stunning food scene for me.First off, we visited on a Thursday but wanted to share that they do $1 oysters and $1oz wine every Tuesday (amazing)... will 100% be back for that.From a first look at the menu, it wouldn't strike me as a French resto as there are the familiar starters like oysters, kale salad and steak tartar. It's character develops a little more as you move down the menu on to the frog legs and snails. After that, mainly crowd pleasing dishes sprinkled with some French & Asian flair. Simple but kept me interested.We decided on their appetizer special for the day which was a salmon pate (missed the actual name of this dish) BUT although nameless for me, it was really good and was bursting with creamy flavour of smoked salmon. For our main we ordered the half duck with crepes which the ensemble oddly reminded me of Chinese Peking duck. Nonetheless, the duck was really juicy and skin on the leg was perfectly crispy and well seasoned. Our service that night was also excellent and from the quality of food we had, I am looking forward to trying other more French inspired items on the menu next time..

I was looking forward to ordering their pork shoulder & sausage....which is one of my most memorable meals.  They no longer offer this...they've been some slight changes to the menu. I ordered the pork loin which came with peas and half a grilled peach. The loin was tender and moist for sure...did it compare to the pork shoulder I had at Chantecler before? Absolutely not! Obviously they are different cuts of meat but regardless I was a tad disappointed. I still remember that fatty pork shoulder just melting in my mouth....The peach and peas did nothing to complement the pork loin. I also wished the sauce that came with the pork was a bit thicker....it would have coated the meat better.For cocktails I ordered Lady Problems, which was good, and the signature grapefruit gin and tonic, which was a bit too tart for my taste. I've had this cocktail before and it was balanced perfectly. For dessert we had the eclair with fernet branca chocolate sauce. This was divine. I did not really taste the fernet branca in the chocolate sauce....but perhaps any more in the sauce would not have been palatable for the average Joe or Josephine.

Restaurant Chantecler,"Went to Chantecler for a NYE dinner and it was a great way to end 2016. We made a reservation online and received a call a day before to confirm. As everyone has mentioned, service is amazing and relaxed, but we saw the servers were swamped. The space is nice and cozy, I like how there is a tiny kitchen in the corner where you can watch the food being prepared. The head chef(?) was in charge of all the chits, manning the fryers, oven, stove, and plating everything--boy was he busy. But while we enjoyed watching him put all the plates together, there were two things that he did that were unsettling:1) While spooning the caviar and using his fingers to place it on the blini, he licked his finger.2) He scored raw duck on a cutting board, then used the same cutting board for our cooked steak.  Anyways, about the food: was so excited to try the popcorn shrimp that I have been seeing in the reviews but it wasn't on the menu :( We were told there has been a new head chef for 8 months now. We ordered the frog legs, which were nicely battered and fried served with sour cream and spicy sauce. It was delicious and wonderfully crispy! There was a NYE special of a caviar blini, which my boyfriend really enjoyed. We wanted to try more appetizers but had to make room for the mains!For the mains, they do family style here, so they're called ""Platters for Two""...but the two of us ordered two anyways and we could comfortably finish everything. We had the snapper and mussels, as well as the steak and marrow.They were generous with the snapper, they gave us 3 fillets (tail pieces) and there were 4 mussels. It was good and hearty. The steak and marrow was a beautiful plate. The NY striploin was perfectly cooked and the sauce was amazing! The marrow was a bit disappointing because it all clumped up into a tiny ball, and then one of bones exploded and split right in half (which was entertaining, but I think it was overheated).",4.0,3.0,135,2017-01-01,43.641719,-79.431247,"French , Cocktail Bars"

The kitchen offers everything from typical pub grub fare to some fancier (and lighter) options like Yellowfin Tuna Tacos ($15), Quinoa Salad ($14) or The Aubergine ($15).

Indie Ale House,"We came here for dinner after Lady Beer Fest. The wait time was significantly less than what we were quoted. There is a small sales shop outside the restaurant area, but still contained within the building.The brewery has a very large dining hall, but we took seats in the bar. Our barmaid was very lovely, knowledgeable and entertained our requests for samples. I finally settled for the Outrageous Fortune, which included chenin blanc grapes in its fermentation? Production? Overall, I found the taste too sour. After tasting different samples at the beer fest, this one didn't have a great taste.Notwithstanding, we asked for recommendations on food and she didn't hesitate on the Southern Fried Chicken. I also had noticed that was the dish that coming out the most frequently from the open kitchen. I ordered it Nashville hot and let me tell you, it was HOT!  The dish came with 3 pieces, potato salad, and ranch sauce, hot & honey mustard sauce on the side. The chicken was indeed spicy so the honey mustard was lost on me, meaning, I barely dipped my chicken in it! It would be nice to have another sauce to complement the heat from the hot version of fried chicken. I ate the salad and chicken!

Indie Ale House,"I've fallen ""in like"" with this place, but not in love -- based on vibe, food and cost. The service is excellent, so a big shout out for that off the top.The upshot: it's a fairly large, upscale craft brew resto-bar that feels like it was transported from a suburb into the city. It's a reliable place for food and drink. The Instigator IPA is indeed great, the burgers are indeed huge, but there's something a bit too box store about this place for me to get fully on board.We dropped in once just for beer. The place was packed, so we were seated near the back, in view of the kitchen window. We were impressed by the food and burger platters coming out of there and thought we should return for a meal. We came back and tried the Indie Burger. This is a classic, two-patty bacon cheeseburger that tasted a lot like a Big Mac (special sauce, iceberg lettuce). It was huge and sloppy in a good way, but there was still something ordinary about it. Not just because it was the house burger -- there are ways to make even classic burgers stand out. One drawback for me from the get-go was that the bun had been toasted, but the top was very cold to the touch. (Wish I'd paid the $2 extra for lettuce wrap instead of the bun!) The bunned burger is $18, with fries or salad included. Don't get me wrong -- it was good. I'd just hoped for something a bit more memorable.  And I might be getting the suburban association from the bathroom -- it's crazy bright in there and completely unadorned. You feel like you're in a gas station restroom at night.

Indie Ale House,"Let me preface *This review is only about the food and service. I have to say both were exceptional! I shared the beet and goat cheese salad which had kale as the main greens. They were prepared wonderfully, soft with enough crunch and very flavourful. Was a great starter. Then the main star showed up! The indie burger on a lettuce bun with fries. Delish all round! I should have taken a photo of the clean plate to vouch for that! Not a crumb left! Haha My company also enjoyed his burger. He had the bison and belly burger and fries. We both were very pleased with the quality of food. You can tell thought was put into the menu and selected dishes. The portions were also very generous. Now I must say apart from the great food, the service was exceptional. Nick was our server. He was fast, knowledgable and overall extremely helpful. Since I have a gluten intolerance, he was able to tell me what to steer clear of without hesitation and even ensured the kitchen was aware to avoid cross contamination to the best of their ability.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Indie Alehouse - I just wish the bison and belly burger was better executed and that the prices weren't so high.",4.0,4.0,221,2016-12-26,43.665441,-79.465238,"Breweries , Gastropubs , Pizza"
Indie Ale House,"Soooo.... I was craving fried chicken on a Sunday morning but woke up too late to check out Stockyards on St Clair which closed early (imo) at 2:30pm. I didn't feel like driving toooo far so I looked up fried chicken places near me in the Junction area. I've been to other brunch places in the area but had no clue what to expect from an ale house... at first I was hesitant since I didn't really feel like drinking more, especially on a Sunday morning on a thanksgiving weekend lol.  I looked up pictures on yelp and the chicken looked good. Wasn't chicken and waffles but I was good for anything at that point of time. Boy.... was I in for a treat!! First of all, since it was Thanksgiving weekend, they were serving a turkey dinner. But this was no regular turkey we're talking about here. It was two huge pieces of Fried Turkey Breast in their regular fried chicken batter w a ton of fancy sides (sorry I forgot , but there was bacon in there somewhere). The server was super nice and said it was the best thing he ever ate. If I didn't have turkey at family dinners over the weekend, I would have ordered that dish for two. Sadly, I didn't want to sleep all day from an itis coma, so I looked at the other options. Second, to our surprise, this ale house not only makes ale but they also made their own sodas in a wide variety of flavours including but not limited to cola, cherry cola, ginger ale, cream soda, etc. Friend went w cherry cola. Holy geez, this was the best cherry cola that I've ever tasted. To be fair, I'm not a huge cherry cola fan, but it was so so so refreshing, light and not overly fizzy that I might have become a fan of that one brand of cherry cola. With that said, next time I'll definitely try their cream soda. For me, I had a couple of americanos. One downside is that they don't serve refillable drip coffee...but americano was okay. Third, let's talk about the real meal deal. They don't have a specific brunch menu. So just full sized portions. Ordered two fried chicken dishes. One original and one Nashville Hot!! One thing I liked about their version of fried chicken was that it was Boneless!! Nice and Crispy on the outside and oh so so soft and succulent on the inside. Simply put, it was Deliciousss. Must dip in the mustard sauce! The Nashville hot version was drenched in chili spicy oil so it definitely left a lingering spice. Dipping the spicy one in the ranch sauce kind of helped. If you are like me and like just a little bit of spice, then go w the original because the original also has a bit of chilli flakes on the fried chicken too but not as super spicy as the other version. I really liked indie pale ale houses version of fried chicken! Definitely hit the spot!! Also on a side note, it came w a delicious potato salad. Overall, good service. Great food. Will definitely come back again to try other items on their menu!!!!",4.0,4.0,221,2017-10-08,43.665441,-79.465238,"Breweries , Gastropubs , Pizza"

Indie Ale House,"I've been a regular here since it opened. Visiting usually once a week because it's generally very consistently good and I'm a huge fan of their beer and food. Read the other reviews for opinions on that.I knew the house managers here and they were fantastic. There's been some turnover and they're gone and unfortunately, the service has suffered. The regular service staff here is generally fantastic but there's been several times where we've been greeted at the door by some very rude people. Not giving us a choice of where to sit, forcing us to seat somewhere we don't want to even when we say we'll wait for another table, then being very rude about it, rolling eyes, etc.. It's really hard to take when I've spent thousands of dollars here over the years, I am always polite and clear about what I want and that I don't mind waiting. The other change they've made is they've shrunk their beer glasses and increased their beer prices. I really don't care about paying more for beer, I get it, costs go up. But not offering a real pint in an alehouse is inexcusable. There is no 20oz glass. You'll get a 16oz shaker pint and that's it. Want a 3.5% cask bitter? 16oz shaker glass. I really don't get that. The owner is supposedly so anal about the beer and how it is served yet he won't serve a real pint?I've also noticed they seem to be cramming more tables inside. It's gotten pretty ridiculous, to the point where now in many places you can't even walk between tables, the service staff can't even get to your plates. I know you want to cram as many paying customers in there as possible, but you need to stop when it's affecting people's experience and service.Anyway, all this is to say, it's a great neighbourhood joint, but getting greedy is no way to keep your regulars.",4.0,3.0,221,2017-11-25,43.665441,-79.465238,"Breweries , Gastropubs , Pizza"

They didn't make a big fuss when members of our party were late (so sorry, Morgan's!), they didn't ask us to sit down while we were taking photos, and they were very attentive when giving us the split bills. We were probably any server's worst nightmare!! But everyone was very nice, friendly, helpful, and service was excellent. They didn't even add gratuity automatically! Onto food and drinks - excellent. There were fancy cocktails (delicious, strong, unique), uncommon beers, and then also some common stuff. Something for everyone! I really enjoyed the Corpse Reviver. For food, we ordered charcuterie, the trio of dips, calamari, and then everyone got their own mains. Everything was delicious. The fried chicken was very popular!! I had the wild boar ragu which was really nice. Fresh and hearty! Crowd is mixed, older (mid-20s and above). Atmosphere was very lively.

Morgan’s On the Danforth,"The service here sets Morgan's apart from the other bars in the area. From the outside Morgan's isn't much to look at - which is why it took me way too long to discover this gem in the neighbourhood! I saw Morgan's listed on BlogTo as having the best nachos in the area and had to go try. I adore nachos and theirs are definitely good. Not amazing, but good. Some of the cheese wasn't melted, and there were quite a few bare chips (it's all about distribution of toppings ) but the charred corn and fresh jalapeños were great. Mostly, sitting at the bar was awesome and our bartender made fantastic cocktails. The prices for cocktails here are very reasonable - with lots of options coming in around the $10/$11 mark. We enjoyed ourselves so much we came back the next day! The place was packed when we arrived, but the owner carried over a barstool so that the two of us could sit at the bar together. We had a different bartender tonight and he was clearly scrambling to keep up with orders. It was hard getting his attention to order even though we were sitting right in front of him. He forgot to tell us about the dinner specials, and when we asked he didn't remember what they were and made no effort to explain them. When I did order a salad, he left immediately to put in the order before I could double check that it was gluten free. The salad arrived with deep fried battered onions on top (not listed in the item description on the menu), and I couldn't eat it. He was very understanding though and had a new salad made and sent over. Just wish he had taken a bit more time so we could have avoided wasting food the first time around! Those minor things aside, this is a fantastic spot and I think my favourite in the area.

When asked questions about the food, staff was very knowledgeable about what is in it. I had to ask because I was allergic to certain foods and had to double check. I didn't have any bad experiences but it took a while to get the bill (seemed understaff when it came closer to closing but I totally understand) while I waited I was able to enjoy the basketball game that was on.

Morgan’s On the Danforth,"Looks small from the outside, but inside is surprisingly spacious. There was even a small patio with a few tables out front. Heading inside, a sheik pub atmosphere welcomed us for Summerlicious. We were seated at the back on the upper level. We checked out the drink menu and I was impressed; they have a great variety of beer! There were many beers I'd never seen before and some usual suspects. They love sourcing locally, but they also embrace the lesser known imports. My aunt tried the Spirit Tree Pub Cider and I was going through Mill Street Organic withdrawals, so I had to have my favourite!  Let's get to the knitty gritty, the Prix Fixe. When it comes to app, all I needed to see was the word 'tostones' and I was sold. Managua style Ceviche on Tostones was our selection. I don't think there was any tilapia in there, but there was a LOT of shrimp. The citrus flavours gave this an airy feel. Could've been a few more chips, but this was a great app. It wasn't heavy and filling, it was just enough to stop the hangry. For our entrees, I chose Gaucho and she went with Southern Comfort. The Southern Comfort consisted of chicken and ribs with a delightful coleslaw and hushpuppies. A beautiful dish. The chicken batter was crisp and not greasy. The ribs were seasoned and sauced to perfection. The meat was juicy and fell right off the bone. To balance the savoury meats, the honey vinegar coleslaw was the perfect side. My steak was cooked to order and came with shoestring french fries. How often do you see those in a restaurant?! The chimichuri sauce was a shining star on this plate. The locally grown herbs complimented the flavours of the steak well. I wish I'd had more to dip my fries in.Dessert has arrived! My Aztec Brownie with Churros was enough to kill the chocolate craving. The churros were unnecessary. They were blah. My aunt enjoyed Oma's Peach Crumble Cake. The cake and crumble were not overly sweet, allowing the peaches to be the star.  The service was great. They were really personable and easy to talk to. The manager made his rounds to make sure everyone was having good time. The timing of each course was perfect; they weren't rushing you, but they weren't letting you take a nap between. This place really has their act together! I'd come back to try their regular menu....I'm a sucker for a gastropub!",4.0,4.0,66,2015-07-28,43.68194,-79.330228,Gastropubs

Hacienda las Américas,"This is definitely one of the most underrated taco joints in the city. Strange how this place is located on a pretty prime part of the city yet it's so easy to pass right by without even noticing it. Probably has something to do with the atrocious decor or there-lack-of. Anyhow, this review is more about the food.Homey is what best describes this place. This feels like a joint run by a Mexican family cooking up some very homey meals. Their tacos, nachos....etc all have a made-at-home kind of feel to it. No fancy plating and unnecessary garnishes. Just straight to the point, flavourful and delicious stuff. The best part is the prices are pretty cheap when compared to other taco places in the city. Value aside, it's their no-frills, un-adulterated way of preparing the food that separates them from the rest of the other taco places in the city. Meats are well seasoned and nicely caramelized, veggies are on point and the proportions of the components are almost perfectly done. There's no spilling of meat and veggies as you bite into the tacos with sauces squirting out in every direction. It seems as though it was very well thought out and eating their tacos doesn't require a bib like most places do.The tacos here remind me of the many fantastic taco stands I had out in the west coast (LA) run by hard working Mexican families using home-made recipes.

Hacienda las Américas,"This place is a gem hidden in plain sight. We recently moved a couple blocks away and decided to try it based on all the good reviews.We had some tortilla chips and guac; tacos and a burrito. Their guacamole is excellent: it has a slightly chunky, rustic texture, and just the right amount of lime and seasoning. Chips didn't appear homemade but were a cut above your standard store-bought.My wife had three tacos: 1 chorizo, 1 al pastor, and 1 fried fish. She raved about the fish taco and also enjoyed the other two. I tried a bite of the al pastor, and it was pretty good, although I have a high bar for al pastor. (Tacos 101 has the best al pastor in Toronto, by far.) All three came in slightly crispy corn tortillas.Meanwhile, I had a chorizo burrito. It was delicious -- mostly meat and creamy rice, with not much ""filler"" -- but very messy, as it showed up on the plate cut in half and drizzed with crema. (It also doesn't help that chorizo is by nature very oily.) I inhaled the burrito with the help of about 15 napkins to clean myself up. It was possibly the best burrito I've had in Toronto.I will definitely be coming back to try more of the extensive menu, which includes moles, enchiladas, pozole and even menudo (!).I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars. For now I am giving 4 as, despite the excellence of the burrito here, I give Tacos 101 the edge on both tacos and tortilla chips.",4.0,4.0,35,2017-11-12,43.656625,-79.406989,Mexican

Hacienda las Américas,"I don't care what they call this place, it's like a home away from home (if I were Mexican I suppose). Their tacos have that hominess that I crave when I go out but couldn't possibly make them this good myself. This restau used to have a slightly different paint job and was called La Loteria. I did ask about the transformation but I didn't totally understand the answer for the re-badging of the restaurant. They still have the sign out front saying $2.50 for chicken tacos. We tried those, plus chorizo (not greasy and full of flavour), and as well the baja fish. All very good! And the guacamole was fantastic too. Their BBQ sauce was smoky and delicious as was the spicy green sauce to go with your chips.

Hacienda las Américas,"One of the most authentic Mexican restaurants I have been to in the GTA. I was the first to arrive from a party of 4, and was greeted by friendly staff. Despite waiting quite some time for my friends to trickle their way in, the servers were kind and always kept my glass full. Since the appetizers and mains were relatively affordable, we opted to try as many dishes as our stomachs can handle, without the worry of emptying our wallets. We had the guacamole and nachos to start, and boy was that a wonderful start to a feast. The tri-coloured nachos were succulently crunchy, topped with a prized amount of ground beef, sour cream, cheese, tomatoes and other ingredients. The creamy guacamole was complimented with smoking hot tortilla chips, an indication that it was made fresh and in-house. On the side were two types of sauces that I do not know the name of, but the orange sauce was more spicy than the Extra-hot Peri Peri Sauce from Nandos! I must have been a daredevil to smother that on my chips.The mains we ordered were the stuffed quesadillas, fish tacos (half off on Fridays), carne asada and emmoladas. My favourite has got to the be the fish tacos and emmoladas. The fillets were fried, yet maintains a subtle scent of the sea. Topped with a generous douse of lime juice, the flavours came alive. The emmoladas, corn tortillas rolled around chicken breast and covered with a chili pepper sauce, were equally tasty. The strength in this dish lie in the perfect meld of chocolate and beans.

Hacienda las Américas,"ok, I don't think this place is called La Loteria anymore because they didn't have a sign nor was the menu called La Loteria, it was called Hacienda OR I am just a complete idiot and went to the wrong place BUT I did double check the address and it was correct (I think).Anyway, came by Friday and lucky me, $2.50 fish tacos. Hell. Fucking. Yes. Got two of those and a nachos. The nachos ($6) was not what I expected. It was so loaded with goodness (tomatoes, feta cheese, drizzles sour cream, green onions, beans) and it was very filling (there was two of us). We also got two fish tacos which was also very loaded (cabbage, tomatoes, sauce, cilantro) and very delicious. The shape of the fried fish was a little questionable though - it was rectangular (no, I am not shitting you).Our bill came up to $15 with tax and tips. Seriously, why would anyone go anywhere else? We got dinner for $7.50 each. Bomb. And yes, I would definitely come back.",4.0,4.0,35,2016-05-24,43.656625,-79.406989,Mexican

Hacienda las Américas,"My wife and I stumbled upon this place after trying to get a seat at Sneaky Dees across the street. What was initially a backup choice ended up being one of our best meals out in a long while.We ordered the chips and guacamole, as well as a mix of tacos (chicken, pastor, and chorizo). Chips and guacamole a generally fail-safe choice anywhere, but these were above our expectations. Both were clearly homemade. The guacamole had just the right amount of seasoning and lime juice for bite, and the chips were thick, super-crispy, and ever-so-lightly salted. Then came the tacos which were easily the best and most authentic we've had in the city. Each came over a perfectly grilled corn tortilla and topped with the traditional onions and cilantro you find at taquerias all throughout Mexico. While all three types were delicious, the chorizo was the true star. The blend of seasonings in the meat was phenomenal. There was even a slight hint of allspice in there; a surprise but it worked phenomenally.The lovely owner also brought out two phenomenal homemade spicy salsas: one kicked-up salsa verde, and a red insanely-spicy-yet-delicious tomato/chili/onion-based salsa. While both were great, the red was the clear winner despite setting our mouths on fire. We'll definitely be back our next time in the area.",4.0,5.0,35,2016-11-22,43.656625,-79.406989,Mexican

Seating, cleanliness and a view of the food preparation area. When I went it wasn't too crowded (11:30ish) but I believe lines form around 12:30 until 2. Nonetheless, they seem fast and efficient. The menu is awesome and great pricing! I love how the menu has vegetarian options in each area too, that's a major plus for me. Decided on tofu fries and a Panko crusted tofu bao. my order was ready very swiftly. The tofu fries were delicious...basically kimchi fries but instead of pulled pork they substitute with tofu.

Banh Mi Boys,"Ever since their debut on ""You Gotta Eat Here"", I loved going to their joint for Steamed Bao and Banh Mi. That was years ago, when they set up shop at their first location on Queen and Spadina. Since then, they've opened multiple locations, and I just happened to stop by the one near Yonge and Eglinton for a late lunch.I ordered their Five Spice Pork Belly steamed Bao with a side of fries, all in for just under $7.50.Their flavours are just like I remembered: salty and savoury from the big slice of pork belly with their signature ""luck sauce"", and sweetness from the bao and pickled veg.What sucks about today though was that I felt there was a bit too much pickled veg. It ended up shoving the pork belly from underneath so when I took a bite of the bottom, all I got was bao and veg. A bit of an imbalance, but I'm willing to look past it.I dug into the fries after my first bite of the bao, and it was all soft... no crispiness. Now, my mentality is: you can't mess up a good fry. There's probably someone who likes soft fries, but I was just hoping for something with a little more crunch.Despite that, I still love Banh Mi Boys and their food.

It was still stuffed with all the veggies but the meat seems to reduce significantly. I still prefer the sketchy Chinatown Banh Mis a bit more, for a cheaper price too.

The sweetness goes well and is a little easier to munch on than the sandwiches if you have a smaller mouth. Really great flavours and great prices. Very convenient as well, you can order beforehand to skip the lines if you want to avoid the lunch rush.

Banh Mi Boys,"I'm not really impressed with Banh Mi Boys. Tried them once downtown a few years ago and just felt it was overpriced Banh Mi. I'm Viet so I'm use to the original stuff in Vietnam or at least the small stores in Chinatown which sells for like $2-3 a sandwich. Decided to give them another go and tried the kimchi fries recently and thought it wasn't too bad but nothing to rave over. It wasn't hot enough for me but the kimchi added a unexpected spiciness to it that I did like. Primary issue I was a bit concerned about is the cleanliness. There were so many fruit flies where I was sitting... It was off putting. Like I had to repeatedly squat them away while eating. Staff need to take garbage out more frequently. Overall, my opinion hasn't really changed. I think its overpriced for what is offered and am confused by why everyone loves it so. If I'm ever in the mood, maybe I'll give them a 3rd chance and try the baos or a Banh Mi again. Lol",4.0,3.0,83,2016-11-27,43.709191,-79.398726,"Vietnamese , Asian Fusion"

The Wickson Social,"This was one of the worst eating experiences I've had in a long time. Do not go here with a large group, or ever.I ordered the pork loin and the dish that came out should have been too embarrassing to serve. The pork loin was the same size and thickness as a McDonald's breakfast sandwich's sausage patty. For brussels sprouts side, there was one quarter or one brussels sprout. This was made significantly more noticeable by the fact that around 8 people of our 20 person group ordered the same dish, and the sizes varited from what you'd expect to what I got. While my dish was the worst, others were also very bad. I suspect they ran out and started cutting down the portion sizes, hoping it would go unnoticed. It did not. I asked them to take the dish back and cancel my order due to the size. It was so obviously mis-proportioned that they couldn't even look me in the eye when they took it back. Then, cheque came and they tried to charge me mandatory 60% tip on my drink and dessert to make up for the lost tip on the dish. Just wow.Also, the service was relatively poor.

The Wickson Social,"Visited the Wickson Social yesterday with 10 colleagues and most of us decided to order from the Summerlicious menu. I e-mailed the restaurant the day before requesting the reservation, and they were great at getting back to me within a couple of hours confirming the reservation. Once we were ready to order, I asked our waitress that my dishes not include onions, she asked if it was a preference or allergy, and I told her it was a preference but that I really hated them (should not have to emphasize that but I did). However, there seemed to be no issue with my request. Once the mains arrived, it looked like my dish was the one without onions (I went with the Summerlicious menu and many of us ordered the same dish). Once I began eating, I found a large ring of onion under my salmon, and I pulled it out with my fork and put it on the side of my plate. I was going to call our waitress over, but by the point a) I had started eating (because I had trusted that my request had been adhered to, and b) because getting her attention was simply too difficult. When she passed by at some point, she did see it and laughed while she said, ""found one"" and kept on walking. Yeah, I found one, and that's a problem!Two of my colleagues shared the cheesecake dessert off the regular menu, and it came with rhubarb - or that's what we though anyway. They said they did not like it, and I found it odd because I love rhubarb so I stole one from their plate and spitted it out. Omg, it tasted like onion! And they said, ""sorry! we were going to tell you that but you grabbed it so quickly."" Then the whole table got curious, and they began to try it, and all agreed that it tasted like onions on the cheesecake, and not at all like rhubarb. I told the staff and they agreed, so they gave my friends a new dessert - but it was too late for me. I was ready to throw up because I really am not joking when I say that I can't eat onions. It really makes me sick - the look, the smell, and most certainly, the taste!All in all...Food:Hit and miss - the colleague who ordered the pasta off the regular menu loved it. The salmon some liked and some disliked. The salmon was smoked, so some found the smoke overpowering. Almost everyone at the table needed condiments to enhance their dish - we requested lemon, salt, pepper and vinegar. One colleague asked to have her salmon heated because it got to the table cold, and what she got back was hot and overcooked salmon. Service: Not great. It was not easy flagging down our waitress, and when they did not have the beer I ordered, I was offered another one, but it surprised me that they charged me for it. 99% of the time, when a drink on the menu is not available, they offer you something else, but don't charge you for it. Anyway, that's been my experience. And I most certainly did not appreciate the amusement and laughter when an ingredient I explicitly asked that it not be in my food, appeared in my food. Even with the average and sometimes annoying service, we were forced to pay the 18% tip as is the case for large groups at most restaurants. We did not feel the service deserved 18%.Portions:I was happy with the portions, and we left full. Ambience:The space is open, colourful and modern. I liked the space.In sum:Considering that this restaurant is near work and my home, I would have considered returning and trying other items on the menu.

For just a small nibble with drinks try the spicy buffalo fried okra.,4.0,5.0,73,2017-05-04,43.665958,-79.385472,"Cocktail Bars , Canadian (New)"
The Wickson Social,"I really don't want to be that DOWNER of a reviewer, but here we go. I came here with 4 other friends on a Friday night around 6. We all arrived at different times, I was the second to get there, and instead of being led through the beauty of the dining hall by the host, I was brought somewhere else. Even though the restaurant wasn't full, the host guided me to some awkward downstairs location, past the bathrooms, past the kitchens, to a really ugly dining room. It really seemed like we weren't cool enough to sit with the people out in the front, and we were embarrassing the restaurant so we were placed in some god-awful location. My friend who got there first said that the host told him that patrons who were eating would sit downstairs and those were drinking would sit upstairs - or something along those lines. (Turns out this was a lie because on our way out, we saw food being served on the nice first floor). Boy was it LOUD down there. We were all shouting on top of each other, and the air conditioning made us all really cold. After the whole dining experience, my friend said his ears were RINGING because of how loud the downstairs was. It was also friggen dark down there. The light was incredibly dim, and none of the curtains were up even though it was still bright outside. Also, we asked for a table for five people, and initially we were given two sad little tables in the corner, with a fifth chair awkwardly placed perpendicular to the rest of us. I had to ask the waiter to keep give us an extra table so we could all eat comfortably.  I usually pick really neat restaurants for our once-a-month get together but I was actually terribly embarrassed to bring them here. The meals were mediocre at best and it was very pricey. I wasn't too hungry, so I got the Spring Risotto and it didn't taste too good. For dessert, my friend and I shared the flourless chocolate cake, which was quite hard and tasted like a brownie. My friends didn't like their dishes very much - especially the pasta and the whipped cheesecake. Overall, The Wickson Social is a very mediocre place. Unfortunately, I will never come back here again.",4.0,2.0,73,2017-05-19,43.665958,-79.385472,"Cocktail Bars , Canadian (New)"
The Wickson Social,"Beautiful space tucked in on St. Joseph street. There is outdoor seating so get here before the summer weather fades!Service is exceptional; we especially loved Saskia who was bubbly and super helpful - all her recommendations were on-point. Crudo of Bay Scallops & Sea Vegetables is fabulous. I haven't seen the Baked Alaska elsewhere so, definitely give this dessert a try if you enjoy peace & raspberries & meringue.",4.0,4.0,73,2017-08-20,43.665958,-79.385472,"Cocktail Bars , Canadian (New)"
The Wickson Social,"What a lovely place! It was hidden along a very quiet street but it was packed with people once we went inside. The decor is amazing and they have a cat mural! What's there not to love? The food was on point and they have curtains in the hall way to ensure new entrants that come in will not bring the cold air in as well. Now on to the food, it was delicious and very nice presentations. I did love every piece I ate and the price was amazing for winterlicious! I think the best part were their drink mixs and I can't wait to go back and try the different ones! I loved my dark and stormy which had a hint of sour. Definitely a place to try!",4.0,4.0,73,2017-03-10,43.665958,-79.385472,"Cocktail Bars , Canadian (New)"
The Wickson Social,"This place is a gem! Tucked away from the hustle and bustle , and touristy Toronto, this is an oasis of incredible ambiance and out of this world food. I was blown away by its atmosphere , the amazing and attentive staff, and the clear creativity of their dishes. The cocktails are impressive as well. Nothing overly ""hipster"" but definitely well-crafted and they pack a punch! I had the deep fried okra which was something I never expected to enjoy but I was pleasantly surprised.What a revelation! I then had the lentil chilli which was amazing. Spicy but not to the point of being painful - just an amazing dance of flavours!The seating and artwork are great - warm and welcoming . Felt comfortable and hard to leave. I recommend this place whole heartedly to anyone and everyone!Thanks you for a great experience!",4.0,5.0,73,2017-01-02,43.665958,-79.385472,"Cocktail Bars , Canadian (New)"
The Wickson Social,"Love the Speakeasy Vibe of The Wickson Social. The sign is so small and you might just miss it in the dark. Walked in through this little door and you would be transport to a different world. A world that serves well crafted cocktails and tasty bar snacks.  A world that is stylish and sophisticated.I just feel like I am all grown up.Apple Pie Sour ($14) - dos, Egg White, Lemon, Apple, House-Made All Spice Syrup was just so delicious and with great presentation!Will definitely drop by for cocktails again. Their food menu is changes seasonally.

The Wickson Social,"The Wickson Social is has everything going for it. Good food, good service, a patio, excellent customer service. However, the only downside is that the place is very ""usual."" There is nothing that distinguishes it from the competition. It is just a good, simple, safe option.",4.0,4.0,73,2017-07-21,43.665958,-79.385472,"Cocktail Bars , Canadian (New)"
The Wickson Social,"This is a fabulous hidden spot off from the busy Yonge Street. The owners of Oxley & Queen and beaver did it again. With stunning interior and great service! If you have a chance to be served by Olivia here, she's great! With a punch of great personality, helpfulness, great recommendations from the menu and care you'll be taken good care of during your visit here.Amazing cocktails and I even love the red washroom with subtle lights that lights up the minute you step into the washroom. Kudos to having another great hangout place downtown.",4.0,4.0,73,2016-06-12,43.665958,-79.385472,"Cocktail Bars , Canadian (New)"
The Wickson Social,"The place itself looks great; cool decor, ambient lighting, friendly service. No complaints there. I gave this place two stars because I wasn't impressed/attracted to anything on their menu. We finally ordered the squash fritti which was...flavourless and undercooked, and the grilled halloumi which was just so garlicky. Both were hugely overpriced. I could maybe come here again for a drink but there's better places around this area in my opinion.",4.0,2.0,73,2016-11-09,43.665958,-79.385472,"Cocktail Bars , Canadian (New)"
The Wickson Social,"A bunch of us came to hang out, grab a drink and get some snacks.  I like the feel of this place, the ambiance and the lighting.  It feels comfy while not overly crowded and noisy.We had a corner table with 6 of us and we all ordered drinks and some of us food.  The Wickson has a pretty wide variety of cocktails and drink selection.I ended up ordering a Left Field Maris pale ale to go with a hand chopped burger and fries.  The burger while not very large was nice break from the factory produced burgers I'm more accustomed to consuming on a regular basis.  This was a little bit of a treat.  When I ordered the burger I was asked how I would like it cooked... my reaction was, ""you can do that?"".  Typically I thought burgers were always cooked medium well or up that being the law or something.  Regardless I had asked for medium.  The burger was very good the meat patty being made by hand was a huge difference.  There is a difference and while it had cheese it was overall just the right thing at the right time.  It didn't stand out as one of the best burgers I've had in recent memory at a drink lounge but it was classy, just like the Wickson.The service here was attentive and friendly and I like the whole feel of this place.  It's sort of hidden off Yonge on a residential street (St. Joseph) which I knew of because my sister used to live basically where this place exists now.",4.0,4.0,73,2016-03-22,43.665958,-79.385472,"Cocktail Bars , Canadian (New)"
The Wickson Social,A very fancy bar downstairs of a very fancy condo. I can't rate the food because I haven't tried it yet but the drinks are very good and the service our group had yesterday was exemplary.  Shout out to our awesome Scottish barman and our waitress. Keep up the great work!,4.0,4.0,73,2017-04-25,43.665958,-79.385472,"Cocktail Bars , Canadian (New)"
The Wickson Social,"Guys, this place totally exceeded all of my expectations. I walk by this place quite often and thought it looked nice -- the reviews on yelp are okay, so we went there tonight. First off, i love the way the interior was decorated. It was very elegant and modern, with a unique flair (the wall mural!). The people who work there were incredibly friendly. I'd say, the walk to the bathroom was also fun, you get a peek in the kitchen and also see some extra, lounge-like space they have in the back. In addition to the great ambience and nice service, the food was incredible. We started off with the spicy buffalo fried okra -- that was wonderful. It was such a unique dish. Okra fried until crunchy, slathered with sour cream and buffalo sauce. It is a bit spicy so if you don't eat spicy at all, this won't be the dish for you. The food portions were HUGE. I got the acadian seafood fricotand when the plate came, it was overflowing with clams and mussels, and buried underneath all of that shelled goodness, there were pieces of monkfish that were so tender yet firm. The sauce that everything was bathed in was incredible.. and it also came with bread with some kind of garlic spread on it -- that dipped in the sauce.. no words. Two members of our party got the night's special with fried chicken and cheese biscuits and those were lovely too. The cheese biscuit was nice and crunchy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside.. all with cheesy goodness. After we paid the bill, we ended up staying maybe another hour just catching up,  and during this time they continued to come by and fill our water --That is not common!I think it says a lot that the 4 of us, who love to eat, gave this place a unanimous 5 star. Love it -- definitely a good spot for dates, friends' get togethers, anything!",4.0,5.0,73,2017-03-26,43.665958,-79.385472,"Cocktail Bars , Canadian (New)"
The Wickson Social,"Fantastic! Stopped on for lunch and had the burger and kale salad, both were really tasty but it was the drinks that sold us on this place. We tried a few different cocktails; the lavender sour, blueberry bourbon fizz, a kerfuffle and their tequila negroni. They were all great as was the service. Also the decor was really cool, modern but cozy.",4.0,5.0,73,2017-06-18,43.665958,-79.385472,"Cocktail Bars , Canadian (New)"
