The main staple of the menu is the katsu (a breaded thin piece of pork or chicken) but Katsuya takes it to the next level. The katsu can be stuffed with cheese, come in a burger or with noodles. The traditional rice option comes with a wide selection of sauces, from creamy carbonara to spicy tomato-garlic to sweet curry. I went traditional and had the Original Japanese Katsu. The katsu was done perfectly, crunchy on the outside while the meat was still moist and juicy. I appreciated the attention to detail in this dish. The katsu rests on a metal grate so it didn't get soggy through the meal. There is a little mortar and pestle to grind up the sesame seeds for the soft white rice. The little pile of cabbage cuts through the grease as you make your way through the meal. Also the portion size here is big! More than enough for lunch and a delicious snack later on. The service is great, helpful and friendly at all times. Definitely would recommend.\",\"We were there on a Saturday evening. It was super busy, had to wait 35 minutes to get a table. There is a cozy corner inside the restaurant for waiting, good for winter time. The waiting was worth it. Despite the extreme busyness, drink was served on time. I had ordered Tom Yum Caesar. It was a bit spicy and had the expected punch. Loved it. The food tasted great. We had tried Pad Gra Prow with chicken and Gaeng Masaman with braised beef. Both dishes were very flavourful. I order mine to make Thai spicy. Bad decision! It was super hot (spicy). If you can't handle spice but would like to try anyway then I would suggest you rather go for mild or foreigner spicy. The portion was moderate. The taste of both dishes were very similar to the same dishes in BKK Thai at North York where I am a regular. If you happen to be in this corner (just North of 401 on Yonge, North York) of the city, I suggest you also try BKK Thai. There food is equally good or better minus the crowd and waiting time. Anyway, it's not as vibrant as Pai and one tenth in size.Overall the service was great. Can't ask for more in such a busy time. Glasses of water were served and refilled without asking. Highly appreciated the extra paper napkins on the table; proactive thinking - guests will need them specially if they try their food Thai spicy. I would love to go there again with a big group.\",\"Yum Yum and Yum (AND AND AND your wallet will not cry of despair). Richmond station is one of the most affordable and low key Toronto restaurants. They love to do everything in house, from cured meats to beer. They also make a mean Kombucha!We got charcuterie (3), ricotta on foccacia, the burger, the black cod and the olive oil and lemon dessert. Charcuterie was a hit, everything is house cured and they have a large variety rotating with the seasons. Burger was fingerlicking good, dripping in juices and exploding in flavors. My favorite of all was the dessert, its was so fun with its contrast of textures and flavors. Each bite was a surprise and a burst of flavor, from the creamy olive oil cream, to the torched smoky sugar crackling, from the tart and fresh lemon curd to the refreshing and fragrant honey jelly.\",\"I love coming to Kinka with friends or for a date (if its the latter Ill make sure to sit outside or else you will never hear each other talk. Overtime, we will order 2-3 dishes/person and share everything with everyone. My favourites are the seaweed tofu salad, the baked oysters (so cheesy and decadent), takowasa (lots of umphhhh) and the karaage.Its a guaranteed fun time every time!\",\"Mymy offers a cool yet casual place on Bloor Street to grab chicken. The restaurant is narrow and long with tables.The environment was lively and my party of 2 was still able to hear one another even though the tables were relatively close to one another.I tried the half and half (for $29) of Gold Cheese and Seasoned Spicy chicken along with a side of fries. The chicken is plentiful and tasty. The seasoned spicy had just enough batter that did not overbear the taste of the chicken. While I was a little skeptical of the Gold Cheese, it made for a good complement to the season spicy. We had enough to take home for another meal. The fries were nothing special and I'd probably choose another side the next time.Overall great value, service, and atmosphere. Would definitely visit again!\",\"A friend highly recommended Under The Table saying they have one of the best Jamaican Jerk Chicken & Oxtail Stew at a reasonable price. Then I checked Yelp and found glowing positive reviews from fellow Yelpers so this really piqued my curiosity to check this place out as people are giving 4 and 5 stars.And boy we're glad we did coz by far this is one of the best jerk chicken and oxtail stew \\u00a0in downtown Toronto! We tried Rasta Pasta and it doesn't even come close to the deliciousness that Under the Table offers.Located in the heart of Cabbagetown, it's hidden below street level and a hole in the wall. The place is also dark and dated but don't let that stop you from coming and checking inside the restaurant. The owners and the staff are the most friendliest bunch we've ever encountered. Service is also 5 star, you know everyone who works here love what they're doing by how well they treat their customers.And the food, OMG, the food here are heavenly! The Jerk Chicken is so addictive - it's smoky, moist, sweet and spicy. It's not the normal jerk chicken leg you find in other restaurants. The dish comes with bite sized jerk chicken, rice and peas, salad and a delicious coleslaw. \\u00a0The oxtail is also fall of the bone tenderness - a satisfying stew perfect for a chilly day. \\u00a0They also give you homemade hot sauce which is amazingly good and spicy.And the best part, the prices are so reasonable. Can't wait to come back and try other dishes from their menu.\",\"I stopped by the other day to look at the menu and I was impressed.So we ordered some barbecue to pick up and take home.It was so tender and juicy. \\u00a0Finally some real Texas barbecue in the city and bonus points for being right around the corner from my house.The owner was very nice. \\u00a0I like the fact that it's a family run place.Sorry Hogtown Smoke, but this is my new go to place\",\"Let's just start off by saying I am a San Diego, California native. Somehow I found myself living in the country side of north New York. I'm guessing not many people would think New York even has a countryside? Anyhow, here in the north country. We literally have NO REAL FOOD. Now you know with the border so close, I had to make a trip out to Toronto! And I literally came out here JUST for food. That's how real the cravings are. THIS PLACE RIGHT HERE. Is THEEE BEST spot for authentic, street tacos or tj tacos (what we call It in San Diego lol) I have been away from home and real mexican food. Not that Tex Mex stuff, for months. I mean like close to a year. How can anyone survive without having food like this?! On to the food, we had to save some room you know. Since our whole trip to Toronto was based around food lol. My husband and I ordered three tacos to share. Knowing I could've had like three to myself. We ordered a fish and 2 cabeza tacos because I didn't want to share lol.These tacos are huge. If you don't know what cabeza is, who cares. Order It anyways, because it's Bomb af lol. No but really, cabeza is the meat from the head, cheek. Face? you know, It sounds weird but it's delicious. The meat was super soft and tender, sounds so cliche but It literally MELTS in your mouth. They also had homemade salsas which paired perfectly, choose your heat! I loved them all, the hottest one was actually really spicy. But I'm into that kind of thing. On to the fish taco, this came out so hot and fresh. It stayed crispy and flakey while I was finishing up my cabeza taco! I wish I was back there, eating one right now. If you've never had a fish taco, what is your life?? It had the usual cabbage slaw, nice white sauce, fresh tomato onion pico. The flavors are so well balanced and dance in your mouth giving you a taste of everything. Basically, don't give It a second thought. Go for It, try something new. You won't regret It!\",\"Everytime I've been here the food has been consistently great. From pasta to salads to apps. I've taken a few friends here and they've all loved it.\",\"This is my favorite place to get hand-pulled noodles in downtown Toronto (there are better places uptown).Best dish from this place is dry noodle with meat sauce. \\u00a0It is Chinese version of \\\"pork ragu pappardelle\\\" with chewier noodle!\",\"best ramen in toronto! (tied with ramen kyuoka near the beaches) i've tried konjiki, hoikkado, sensotei, and kinto ramen and hands down, this place exceeds the other places in flavours, uniqueness, and portion sizesbeen coming here for the last year and i'm finally writing a review because i was not a yelpie beforei always get my ramen with a side order of their rice (a dollar cheaper than ordering separately). although the rice is very simple, their taste is anything but that. the rice has a hint of sweetness and the meat is so tender and juicy. and the nori + mayo toppings elevate the flsvour to the next leveli normally get their black tan tan noodles because i love spicy food and the price is good and it has never disappointed me. the last time, i decided to get red dragon ramen and i was so happy and satisfied! the bowl was a party central to all the flavours and texture. i finished everything and drank all tbe broth! there were tons of toppings and i liked the fact that they included a full size red chilli pepper in their bowlhighly recommend this place\",\"Quietly tucked away in Hayden Street, this don place is perfect for lunch and dinner in the Yonge/Bloor area! Simple white and natural wood colour d\\u00e9cor with gray flooring keeps it modern and clean. Since discovering the spot, it seems they've picked up fast on Ritual. Miso soups and don bowls were flying into their takeout boxes and crowds of people came in to pick up their orders. The open concept kitchen lets you see everything, and the bar stool benches for dining in provide a hybrid of intimacy and community unique to small shops such as these (think ramen shop, but modern d\\u00e9cor). What brings us back is definitely the convenience and so far, the no-complaints about the menu items. We were craving dons and this spot popped up. It was a late weeknight, activity was slow, the place was quiet and calm. We picked out the Japanese curry don (update: not on the menu currently in Jan 2018) and their signature Buta Fire don. We also got their karaage to top up the meal. It was a bit of a wait, but we did see the kitchen progressing and felt reassured. The karaage is crunch and flavourful, moist and served hot - no complaints. The curry don I got vegetarian, which was more than sufficient as we had the karaage as well. The curry sauce was flavourful and just the right level of spice for me (basically mild kick) which meant I could still taste the other flavours. The Buta Fire comes topped with tons of pork, and also has a small kick of spice to round out its flavour. Both dons were satisfying and immediately made it on the roster of go-to meals near the office.Recent visit rotated out the curry don and was replaced by the sake lover - salmon and wasabi, a deconstructed salmon maki roll almost. Lots of salmon sashimi, a good amount of wasabi (more than I needed) and rice with cabbage, crisps, and mayo. It wasn't as refreshing as expected, but satisfied the \\\"I want sushi\\\" craving while still being a filling meal.\",\"What can I say about Rasa.. besides that our whole night was exceptional! From walking into the restaurant we felt such a warm welcome and greeting from the hostess/host and manager. Although we did not have a reservation, we were luckily accommodated for a table for 2 and was immediately served water (water service is crucial always!) The style of Rasa is very tapas.. everything they make is smaller in portion size but nice to try multiple items and share with your party. We were so eager to try their menu and was provided great advice from the manager and our server... a Must is the chopped salad. It is not anything like a regular salad, has a great flavour and spice to it with the use of fried chick peas, feta cheese, kale, quinoa and other veg. Very refreshing and light tasting. We also tried the fish sampler, and it came with 3 different types... one was similar to a banh mi style shrimp toast with hoison sauce and green onions.. was very tasty, warm and delicious! Prob my favourite out of the 3 different types.. my husband really enjoyed the ceviche as it was flavoured and seasoned with pepper chilli oil, chives and peanut butter. The flavours were so intense and they actually jive so well! The third sampler we got was a red tuna and it was good but not memorable as the other two.We also got the burger since everyone has bene raving it is the best burger out there! It was delicious from the bun to the meat to the toppings... everything is made in house (even the burger bun!!) and it tasted juicy, meaty and had all the write toppings all together. This dish came with some home made root chips which was nice!Lastly, we ordered this truffle mushroom gnocchi style dish (don't remember the exact name..) but it was to die for!!!!! My favorite dish of the entire night. The gnocchi itself was super fluffy and super truffle tasting which i loved. It was also so nicely presented!!! Love love this dish and could go for some more.For dessert we got the sticky bun, it was good.. but i think next time we will try the lava cake instead. The sticky bun is huge though so can definitely share with 3 or 4 people after such a great meal.But i must condemn the staff at Rasa. Impeccable service, never felt out of place and was always taken care of. Thank you Rasa staff for making our meal so enjoyable!!\",\"Stack was delicious!! They have very many options for any type of diet, including a vegetarian section. The shared BBQ plate that serves 3-5 is probably a great option for a group. The milkshake options are plentiful- the surprise ones are especially fun. The service was very good. Our waitress had great menu knowledge but towards the end of the meal was a bit less attentive. There is a BBQ rotisserie/pit towards the back. I watched the staff load and sauce ribs which was fun!\",\"Totally decent ramen alongside exceptional marketing.As you wait in line you cannot help to listen to people talking about \\\"Michelin Star Ramen\\\". \\u00a0 Which is a total misnomer. \\u00a0Sure, the small location in Shibuya has been listed as a Bib Gourmand restaurant... but these are kinda a dime a dozen. \\u00a0There ARE Michelin star ramen joints in Tokyo... \\u00a0but unless you're willing to get to Tsuta or Nakiryu and wait in long line for their Dandan noodles you're out of luck. Back to Konjiki. This is a good ramen joint. \\u00a0Actually, a very very good ramen joint. \\u00a0 But the inconvenience of having to wait through the hypefest to get inside is a bit of a diminishment to what otherwise is a fantastic meal. \\u00a0 \\u00a0The shoyu intense clam broth is an absolute delight. \\u00a0I would dunk my head in the broth if it wouldn't kill me dead. \\u00a0I also tried the spicy pork, which was also quite good.I wasn't a huge fan of the Karage chicken, but it could have been just in comparison to the ramen. \\u00a0 Also, my diet coke was flat. \\u00a0 But you can't win 'em all.It's the promise of the word 'michelin' that gets 'em through the door. \\u00a0 It's a door worth entering, but concentrate on the actual ramen and broth itself and enjoy the ride.\",\"*Important: I don't eat meat only seafood, meat reviews will be from other person that joined me*Came here for my friends birthday, the staff was very very welcoming and the seating is cozy and modern. It's a great place to chow down with a group of friends or to have an evening bbq with a friend. It was all you can eat and the waiter was kind enough to suggest what we order and she explained the menu. I personally loved the sweet potatoes (highlyrecommended), enoki mushrooms, zucchini and the seafood. The food paired well with the sauce given to you. I also tried the bimbimbap without egg, it was a small portion but the sauce made it delicious.My friend that ate majority of the meat enjoyed the variety offered, you might have to order a bit of everything to know which meats you prefer. The meats were sliced thin enough to cook quickly. The staff was also super excited to sing happy birthday and bring out a candle for my friend, I found it to be super sweet.I would have liked if there was tofu to grill or more seafood optionsLastly, dessert creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e was small but delicious and the melona bars were good too!\",\"The lineups are still quite long. But if you are travelling as a solo or couple one way to beat the line ups is to go straight to the bar and sit at the bar to order your food. They serve the full menu there and will take you right away (no waiting for a buzzer!) as it is first come first served. We got there around 10:30am on a Sunday morning. The lineup to get a buzzer was about 5 minutes, and then the wait for a table for 2 was about 50 minutes. The host offered us the bar seating which was available right away and we decided to go for it. Nobody was seated at the bar when we got there, but it did full up shortly afterwards.The bar seating was not bad and service was immediate since the bartenders are always there. We ordered two brunch items to share. Lemon ricotta pancakes (to die for!) and green chilaquiles with carnitas (chicken) and eggs (also very tasty). Later I noticed others having the fried chicken waffles benedict and had some serious order envy. Next time for sure! Between the two of us we could barely finish our orders. We took home half the pancakes for later. Overall a very satisfying meal. Once we were done we quickly paid for our order and were out by 11:40, probably around the time we would have been getting our seats if we had waited with the buzzer!After walking around the mall, on our way out we stopped at the cheesecake counter and ordered a slice to go. That again took minutes for them to get packed up for us. So while the food is great and portions generous, I don't think it is worth waiting for more that 1 hour for. So I will only go back if the wait is shorter (which is probably going to be a while yet) or go straight to the bar for a seat or just order takeout.\",\"Been wanting to check this out for a while. Loved the decor, would want to visit in the summer time for the patio too. Huge menu of beer, love it. Order the fries and share it. They really give a lot. We also got brussels mussels and some meat pizza. \\u00a0Yum, will come back!\",\"What else can I say about this wonderful place. The service was fantastic, the food was fresh, flavorful, authentic and simply amazing. Our group of 4 came in here really unplanned as we happened to be in the area. I love the fact that it is a small place but felt very cozy and inviting. The decor was very well put together and really felt like you're in a local New Orleans restaurant.We ordered cajun calamari, coconut beer shrimp and mussels for appetizers and for the main course the fresh fish of the day (3) and Fisherman's plate (1), All were excellent choices! The owner Mike was so friendly, he spent a lot of time talking to us and just having a great conversation. In fact, we were having such a good time, we were the last customers by the time we left. Mike even gave us some shots (i forgot what they were but it was good) and also some parting gifts with their special seasoning! Thanks Mike! We will surely come back on our next business trip to Toronto.\",\"This place is BOMB! The torched sushi at this place is really good! I came here on the weekend on there last day of their grand opening promo. Luckily I had 3 people (including myself) with me so I could pretty much order the entire menu and try almost everything they have. This was my order: All torched obviously - Salmon \\u00a0(got extra 3 pieces from their promo)- \\u00a0Spicy Salmon- \\u00a0Shrimp- \\u00a0Tempura Shrimp - Unagi - Red snapper- Tuna  - Poke bowl and torched spicy salmon poke I would describe every single torched sushi on that list but then this would be a long ass review and take too much typing. Needless to say the best and my personal favorite was the salmon which I got extra of too. It was a great choice to get more of the salmon too. The salmon is soft and loaded with so much flavor. I find that this place is also quite generous with there slices of sashimi that they give you. They do not pack the whole aburi with rice. The portion ratio of rice versus fish is well balanced. My least favorite one was the tempura shrimp. I just thought it was very original and didn't have much creativity or much flavor to that one. Perhaps I should of ate it with some soy sauce but most of the time aburi's you rarely need to dip it into soy sauce since there is already taste. Both poke bowls were outstanding! Very generous in quantity and I thought the size was perfect for 2 people to share or even 1 person ( if your super hungry). The torched salmon poke was the first I have ever eaten torched poke and it did not disappoint. The original poke bowl was very good as well. They give you really good toppings such as seaweed salad, corn, peas, avocados and a mix of tuna and salmon fish. Very delicious spot for aburi's and poke in North York. Definitely would come another time and eat everything on my list all over again and maybe try the yam & banana.Staff there are really nice and pleasant. Cool guys! Parking is a tough considering this place is located right on Yonge Street. There is limited parking in the Katsuya plaza. Your best bet is to find street parking on the two side residential streets, but even there can be tricky depending on timing.\",\"I LOVE this place!! \\u00a0Came by for dinner on a Friday night and everything from food to atmosphere was simply PERFECT!! Waiters were very knowledgeable and helpful with the wine and food menu. The atmosphere was very romantic which was fitting for 2 (or even 4) people. Let me just say that if you want to impress someone on a date - this place is it.The butter that came with the bread was SO unique!! If I remember correctly it was made infused with honey! So good!!! For the main course we got the Cornish hen and the lamb shank. The Cornish hen is amazing and the lamb shank?! Omg fall off the bone tender and sooo juicy and tasty!!I am DEFINITELY coming back and I highly highly recommend this restaurant!!! You won't regret it!!\",\"Wow. Finger lickin amazing. $14 two piece chicken and waffles. Every bite was unbelievable. You might have to wait a bit, but it's worth it. Got a very homey feeling. Super casual and chill. I need to eat it again asap.\",\"Great ambience and very helpful staff! The manti - such perfect appetizer, highly recommended - truffle rice and fried chicken were delicious. Not a big fan of the cauliflower though, the oil and sauce were too strong flavours for me. Definitely going back to try more of their delicious dishes.\",\"I wanted to try our Sabai Sabai for a while! Finally got the chance to for a birthday dinner. The ambiance (Friday Night) was awesome! Packed house, we had reservations. Fun music, awesome cocktails (generous amount of booze) and the food was delicious! Got Green Curry with Chicken, as well as Taro Rolls to share with my partner. They brought out Coconut Sorbet for the birthday boy, so got to try that as well - D E L I S H!!!!!Definitely coming back! Recommend reservations though :)\",\"love this place! such a gem in parkdale. the prices are very affordable for the quality and size of the dishes. cost between 10-15$per dish. the people are friendly and the place is clean and nicely decorated with Tibetan paintings or landscapes.the portions are huge so sharing shouldn't be an issue. my friend and i got their daily lunch special: chilli chicken and it came with soup, their dumplings, gyuma, and c-momo.Gyuma - Tibet beef style sausage. it honestly looked like Vietnamese's stuffed intestines. I thought the flavour was nice - meaty and spicy but not too overwhelming. My friend thought it was blandC-momo (beef) - their spicy dumplings. Each dumpling was huge and stuffed to the brim. It came in a red spicy sauce which added tons of flavour. I tried without sauce and it was still tasty and flavourfulChili chicken - I know why it's such a hit with the crowd. it came with rice, a fried meat dumpling (2nd best), a steam bun to soak up all the gooey goodness of the chili chicken, and soup of the day. All this, only for 12$!! \\u00a0The chicken was so flavourful and it was spicy. in my experience, spicy food from restaurants are never spicy and i always have to ask for additional hot sauce. \\u00a0but this place delivered everything - from spiciness to quality to the friendliness/helpfulness of staff.highly recommend!\",\"How awesome is it to see a restaurant packed to the brim on a Monday night? I love Toronto for that reason - a weekday night shouldn't be wasted at home.Guys - the food is amazing here. There are tons of sausages for everyone (game meat, normal meat, vegetarian!), and top it with anything you'd like. I'm not going to tell you what to do here because honestly - everything looked and smelled amazing - I don't think you can go wrong here. The price is right as well - an order of duck fat fries to share and two dogs on a bun = ~$24. I'm not a big fan of beer, but for those beer aficionados - there seemed to be a lot on tap. If you're looking for a quick, cheap meal - Wvrst will leave you happy and full.\",\"Omigosh this place is cute and gorgeous at the same time. They totally maximized their space to perfection. Although the table of 2s in the center of the space was tight, the round tables itself were sturdy and rustic. The food presented was nice (it could have been bulked up a bit more), but the taste was great. I ordered the Eggs Hemingway was delicious and the salad was great and not overly dressed. This is a fairly new brunch restaurant -opened only 2 months when we went. The service is great too. Everyone is nice, friendly and super helpful. I'd definitely come back (hopefully get a booth seat next time hehe)Bunnies is the theme and I wouldn't change it!Great job on the business guys! You made my weekend that much more fun this weekend!\",\"Food, ambience, service, value: 4-4.5/5Everything is good to superb. Finally a terrific resto in Baldwin Village. This is my favorite Japanese bar by far now. Would highly recommend reservations for 2 or more in advance as this is a cozy establishment :) I can see this place catching on fast.Other notes: Only alcohol served here is sat\",\"I have been to the Oxley a couple of times and enjoyed my experience each visit.On my first visit catching up with a friend over lunch, I ordered the fish pie and was in comfort food heaven. Creamy sauce studded with tons of yummy seafood and a baked buttery potato topping - omg amazing.My mom and I enjoyed a lovely brunch on my most recent visit this past weekend. I opted for the smoked salmon on freshly baked scones with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce, very very good. For my mom's dish, she chose the daily quiche (mushrooms and aged white cheddar that day) which was served with a fresh green salad and loved it.Absolutely will return when in the neighborhood again.\",\"Her Father's Cider Bar is a place that knows what it does well and sticks to it.Without question, the owner (Josh) and his fantastic staff know their cider. There are dozens of options from the local to import, traditional to funky. They can recommend based on preference or on what your food order is and you will not be disapponted.The menu is simple, short, and local. The quality of the food is excellent and the staff are honest with their recommendations. Particular standouts for me is the fried chicken and the home made gnocchi. I have had the pleasure of dealing with Josh and his staff for a private event, team dinner, and a private date and all evenings were enjoyable. I highly recommend a meal or drink here regardless of your passion for cider!\",\"The kind of food you'd be happy to get fat eating.Just checked this recently-opened place with my brother this afternoon. I had the chicken and pork street tacos and they were both excellent; easily two of the best tacos I've ever had.The tortillas tasted and had the texture of being made in-house, the flavours of the meat, cilantro, and onions, complemented each other well, and the various flavours of help-yourself salsas brought it all together.My brother and I split the churros for dessert. They were filled with caramel and topped with tart raspberry compote. Predictably delicious.The whole bill for the both of us was under $25, so some great value too.Seriously consider checking these killer tacos out if you like spicy and authentic Mexican food.\",\"Came here Saturday evening with 3 others. We ordered 5 meats, 5 cheeses, 3 olives, 3 sharing plates (pork ribs, sweet potato bravas, and arancini), and cocktails (I had a pumpkin spice specialty cocktail). The cheese and meat board came with 4 slices of bread, a few slim pieces of toast, and some jam, Dijon, and butter. Everything was good. Special shout out to the pork ribs over mac and cheese, they were PHENOMENAL! The melted cheese inside the arancini were a pleasant surprise. I also loved the Rondin du Poitou goat cheese and Chorizo Iberico. Service was slow, our server apologized a few times about it. But the ribs over mac and cheese were so good that I don't even care. Also they do NOT ACCEPT AMEX!!\",\"2018.01.29Here is an update to my last review. Since going to Baretto for the first time, it has become one of my favourite Coffee / Breakfast and Italian lunch places. I have over the last two years become closely acquainted with Manuelle and his wife, Cristina, the owners. They are such lovely people and they put out the freshest and most delicious Italian food in the city. Its simple, fresh, homely and FREAKING DELICIOUS!!!The coffee .....ohhhh the coffee...... If you have never heard of a Ginseng latte (i didn't), you absolutely need to go here and get it. Things my wife and I have tried here so far: All the pizzasLasagnePastaBoth the antipastoCaprese SaladIced milk with mintCroissantSfogliaItalian Cream puffGinseng LatteRegular LatteI give all of the above a 100/100I give the service a 100/100 Original review....I was in the Don Mills area and wanted a quick breakfast and was about to head to McEwans when I came across this place on yelp. It is located in the rear or this rather inconspicuous medical building. Let me start by saying that Yelp does not have the number of stars that I would like to give this place. The barista is a true gentleman named Manuelle who really makes you feel welcome. The place looks wonderful and there is another room as well that is a little more intimate and private. I had a coffee and a croissant and it's was delicious x \\u00a0. The place is clean, open and really relaxing. Will come back here for the food and post another review.\",\"Great ambiance. Small and cozy. Very tasty food and comprehensive list of drinks and well-made cocktails. Been for brunch, dinner, snacks and many times for \\\"just drinks\\\", too. Good, straightforward staff.  Buck-A-Shuck on Tuesdays is A1.\",\"Came to try out this new restaurant on a weekend and it did not disappoint :)!Restaurant is bright and spacious. Walked in a got a table right away.We ordered one cream toboki and one spicy toboki plus popcorn chicken. Both tastes amazing. However, if ur not a spice lover, I strongly suggest you to not get the spicy toboki because it's way too spicy. I looked at other people and they were all dying from spice at the end.Definitely will visit again :D\",\"I have been here several times and like and appreciate it. With that said, based on my latest visit, this is a generous four-star rating.First and foremost the food. I very much appreciate the items on the menu (rice, udon noodles, more recently ramen noodles and other staples of Japanese cuisine), which are not made fusion or Canadianized. No gimmicks here. What is more they offer varieties related to the owner's Kyoto hometown.The taste however leaves something to be desired. The food needs much more flavour. Japanese food needs marination and dashi and Manpuku needs to step up.The portions are small, but I have to say that I was completely full for $11 because I ordered two dishes. yes, the prices... knowing they are in a food court and next to a college the prices are economical.I had the shigure rice bowl and missed the shoga (ginger) taste, It lacked favour, which is why they offer you Japanese seven spices automatically. The rice was fine. The bowl was $7, which is fair. They also offer alcohol and Japanese cheesecake, etc.Think about it. Their ramen bowl is $8 (which is how much a ramen bowl is in Japan) and they are only one small non-corporate location. In contrast some of the other ramen chains in town charge double that (and I have to say while they offer a little more quantity the quality of some ramen in town leaves a lot to be desired so it is not like we are comparing very bad ramen to very good ramen either). Kinton needs to improve its broth, get better chashu. Sensotei's tonkotsu is not even tonkotsu. Touhenboku is rather bad. I don't even bother with places like Ajisen..ServiceThis place is packed and they are rushed. With that said, they are all Japanese so they never comes across as impolite or dismissive. Unlike Kinka, Sake bar Kushi, Uncle Tetsu, etc. the black t-shirt clad staff are entirely Japanese here. The good looking owner has done the same thing for over ten years and is still attentive and caring. They could probably use an additional waitress, but fact is where would they stick the person?? lolUpon entrance you are given a menu and asked whether you would like tea or water. Everything else moves at varying speed i.e. depending on how busy they are could be fast or slow.The waitress/cashier are still polite.They are in a food court, but occupy the favoured walled-off and dine-in space with waitstaff. Amazingly, for $11 or so one could have a meal and a side, which is what eating at the crappy junk food (McDonalds, Popeyes...) stands next door would cost you!During lunch here I had the pleasure of sitting next to what sounded like a student and her teacher and could overhear the entire conversation with what sounded like a pretty straightforward attempt by her to pick him up. I am all for younger women/much older men relationships (and anything else that anyone's heart desires), but kept wondering if there are rules for student/teacher relationships. Whether he ended up saying yes to her or not I cannot be sure, but he did pick up the bill for both of them lol.I recommend you order udon if you go to Manpuku.\",\"We came here for a dinner with my husband. The place takes reservations and there is basically no wait. It is Bar/Restaurant type of place. They have pretty wide selection of liquor, whether its wine or cocktails. Seafood is very good prepared. My husband ordered oyster combo platter and I went with baked fish. Prices were fair, expensive but worth it. If you want good drink and fresh seafood \\u00a0- this is the right place!\",\"Came here last spring and this place totally rocked. I LOVE GUAC when its good. Their guac is a good chunky mix without a bunch of seasoning, so it really just brings out the avocado and some citrus notes. Another honorary mention is the churros. Spot on, light and fluffy.\",\"As most of my reviews go I like to focus on the place as a whole. For starters, I never heard of the place until I met the owner. He is a well rounded and friendly individual, which can be seen in how he approaches his food selection and interior design. The menu is a mix of comfort food meets Toronto culture/cuisine. It is a nice fusion! In terms of location, ambiance, food, and service, here is what I thought:Location - considering the ample amount of street parking and the streetcars passing by every 15 minutes or so, the location is very convenient and easily accessible. Ambiance - the location gives a very relaxed and friendly vibe. The attire is casual and the interior design is well put together and welcoming to all. It has sufficient lighting and music to make the experience a memorable one. Food - I ordered three dishes and glass of red wine. I ordered Jerked Octopus salad, Collard Green poutine (vegetarian option) and the kale salad. 1) Jerked octopus - was very tasty. The jerk flavor was the right amount and the octopus, which is typically very hard to cook properly, was really well done. I was impressed because the last few experience with grilled octopus was disappointing because it came out rubbery and overdone. For sure this place knows how to prepare a great grilled octopus. I recommend it if you like this kind of seafood.2) Collard Green Poutine- I had no idea what to expect but what I knew going in is that I grew up eating and loving collard greens and poutine so combining them would probably be a good thing. It was. I recommend. The flavors of the collards and poutine all complemented one another very well. 3) Kale Salad - YUM! just order it and eat it. The caesar-type dressing, which I had to ask for some to go, was well made. The kale is fresh and the fried capers, grilled grapes, and parmesan cheese really make a good combination. Thoroughly enjoyed the dish.Hope this review helps you out.\",\"Damn near 5-stars across the board so who am I to break the love-fest over this new-ish addition to the Dufferin-Grove neighbourhood. Admittedly, we were looking for somewhere to grab a quick lunch prior to visiting some friends in the area, we had been cruising Bloor and refreshing Yelp to find something.We had passed a pizza place a couple blocks earlier and decided to pull over and park and walk back. However, we ended up finding parking directly in front of Black Briik and their sandwich board hilariously said that they had Brunch and A/C on the menu today. With the 40C heat, it was a wise bet, because we quickly crunched the numbers on walking 2 blocks in the heat vs eating at the place that was advertising A/C. Easy decision.It's a smaller restaurant with maybe 20-25 seats set in a mix of high-top tables, regular tables and some bar seats but its industrial design with some modern flair (inclusive of a Toronto skyline mural done by a local middle eastern artist) gave it warm big restaurant feel.One of the owners (Frances I believe his name was) was our server and offered us both the lunch and brunch menus. After some debate, my SO went with the Dirty Corn Hash (sans ham and with scrambled eggs) while I oped for their Juicy J Burger with well-done crispy fries.Being pregnant my SO is definitely well in tune with her taste buds and loved the Hash from first bite, unlike traditional versions the chef at BB mixed it up with an almost curry-indo/asian spice blend which was subtle but fragrant, I had a bite and it was fantastically different from the normal brunch offerings around the city. And served with thick/sweet/buttery slices of brioche type bread, mamma and our baby to be were VERY satisfied.As mentioned, my main was the burger and fries, not the healthiest option but what the hell - Yolo right? I ate the fries first because I LOVE well-done fries when they're hot. These were something else, I know it's hard to rave about fries but there was an amazing seasoning either on the fries or p[erhaps it was just the flavours of the oil on them, but they were amazing. Also, while I cannot confirm the science on this, they somehow cleared up my raging heartburn that I had been suffering from all day. The burger was excellent as well, a large fresh bun, topped up with a juicy pattie (NOT cooked well done - thank god). The food was excellent but it was the owner that really sold the place for us, taking time at the end of our meal to have a great conversation with us about the coming baby, his excitement over the restaurant's success thus far and even a little fantasy football chat for me. He was super nice to the point that I kinda felt like I should have given him a hug as we left... I don't know why, he just gave us both a real warm reception.This was the happiest meal mistake I've made in ages and one of the best lunch/brunches we've had in awhile. If you're in the are or are looking for something awesome to eat I definitely recommend you pop by Black Briik.Eatcrest Out\",\"This location is perfect and intimate! Though it gets kind of cold when anyone goes in or out! The food is almost the same as the front and church location. However, just a slight difference. It's not as spicy but I enjoyed it nonetheless. They have different appetizers as well! We can't wait to try the beef satay! Decor and atmosphere was 5 stars and the food was 4 stars! Definitely worth the price!\",\"Love this restaurant, food, and Nobu's passion for food.Is he a little quirky and weird? Yes. Will you wait a long time for food? Yes. Should he probably change the tagline \\\"fast food\\\"? Yes. \\u00a0He is genuinely good person, immigrated from Tokyo, and genuinely loves food, Japan and Canada - it's evident by the way he decorates the place (you'll se what I mean). Totally understand that there are 1 stars for the service, so if you are in a hurry, definitely don't come here. But the food is amazing for the price that it's at, and I give a lot of credit to any entrepreneur trying to make it and pursue his passion.\",\"This restaurant is located near my office in Toronto and it is one of the places we like to go as a team.... the food is very good, the ambiance is perfect - whether you are going as a couple or as a small group and the location cannot be beaten.The group had meat and pasta - and all loved their dish.I once had the beef and once had the chicken and both were really good. The chicken had a little twist giving it a bit of a different personality.This is definitely my go-to place with colleagues or even by myself when traveling.\",\"I didn't use to like Italian food until I tried the food at Agio, which speaks wonders as I'm a considerably picky eater. Everything from the appetizers to the main course and desserts is impeccable.Marino is an extremely talented chef and charming host who takes the time to get to know his customers when he's not busy cooking behind the scenes. Although the restaurant is a tad small, it makes for a cozy experience with some friends or family. You won't regret coming here!\",\"Probably my favorite BBQ joint ever. My only advice is to avoid coming on a weekend. I made that mistake and I had to wait in line for almost an hour and a half before I could order. That being said, for me to still give this place a 5 star review should say a lot about how I feel about their food.From the moment I stepped foot through the front door, I already start salivating because it smelled so good. Then when I finally got to try the beef brisket, pulled pork, and ribs, I was so impressed. Each meat was just so succulent, juicy, and flavorful in their own right. The homebrew sweet peach tea was also a nice touch to the meal - refreshing and well-steeped. Yum, if you live or work nearby here, I would definitely recommend you visit on a weekday for lunch!\",\"I read some of the reviews on here. Some people are weird, rating a $15/person place like it's a 4 star restaurant or something. Rate accordingly to the price bracket people, you're here for food, not ambience or service. Another few that were off to me, \\\"the fish was charred\\\". Um, no, it isn't, the skin is, but you peel that off. Lol a few of them were like, \\\"Well, we reserved for 10 people, one cancelled, and we were still charged for the extra person\\\". Lol, kids, split the $15 between the other 9 people. Iunno, different strokes I guess. But for $15, in 2018, with no price increase despite 20% increase in minimum wage, this place deserves all 5 stars and then some. All of the food was delicious, delivered hot, with excellent garlic fried rice. You should definitely check this place out before they close, because if they don't raise prices, with the amount of good they give, they can't stay open for long.\",\"Perfect 5/5. Seeing a store with 5 tiny speciality stores combined (sushi burrito/poke/salad, noodle soups/dim sum, bubble tea, Fried chicken, and japanese crepe) run by a 2 person crew had me drop my jaw. We ordered the chicken nugget bento box and the salmon burrito. The Chicken nugget bento came first and it comes with a respectable portion of fried chicken that tasted very juicy and tender on the inside. The outside was covered with a satisfying crunch in every bite. I would definitely order again. I really liked the attention to detail and how there was some seaweed seasoning on top of the rice and some vegetables and sliced mangos. This dish tasted really good with the hot sauce on the side when I asked. The server was very kind to offer this for me.The sushi burrito came a bit later but it was top notch as well. Great combination and portions when I shared it with my partner. We liked that there were corn and crabmeat but part of me wished there were some avocados too. But overall it was nicely wrapped and tasted great. I dont think there is another joint in this neighbourhood right now that offers sushi burritos! (correct me if I am wrong)Anyways we will definately be coming back and I hope this place doesnt get too popular as I know (as per the review below) that blogTO will definitely pick up on this and the lines here will get crazy. Best of luck Mega!Note that until Jan 31st 2018, you can get 1 free pop with visit ! Free is good :D\",\"Sansotei is my favourite place in Toronto for ramen, bar none. Although the lineups can be long, the wait is worth it. My go-to is the spicy tan tan which hits the spot in terms of heat and flavour. I usually get it with thin noodles as I find it makes it easier to eat.Be prepared to share your table with other diners, this restaurant is very small so communal dining is a thing. They do tend to turn the tables quite fast, however, so musical chairs is unfortunately a necessity during busy times.Other popular items on the menu include the tonkotsu ramen and zangi (chicken karaage) which are both amazing in their own right. Personally, I like things spicy so have not ventured past the tan tan.If you like ramen, go here immediately. Others might imitate, but Sansotei is the best in the city by far!\",\"My friends and I came to Kingyo to celebrate a friend's birthday. As odd as it may sound coming from someone who has yet to visit Japan, it can only be described as the most authentic izakaya experience I've had thus far. At least, authentic with respect to my romanticization, imagination, and social media-driven impression of what it should be. From the heated stones to grill the wagyu and beef tongues, the overt and unadulterated freshness of the seafood, the thought put into composition of these vibrant dishes, the tasty synergy to the sake, to the live goldfish aquarium in the middle of our table; Kingyo has been the most memorable izakaya experience up to the time of this writing.The two highlights I'd like to bring forth include the stone bowl uni don and the kaisen don. The briney and creaminess that is uni with the scallions and the vegetal crisp texture of nagaimo fit perfectly with the piping hot rice. Just sampling once from my friend's bowl prompted me to get my own to devour, despite the party having moved on to the birthday cake. The kaisen don I was barely able to restrain myself long enough to snap a shot. Beautifully put together and very fresh.Every course, plate, and bowl that arrived initiated a sort of ritual. To savour slowly to extend the bliss as much as possible, take some sips of sake which in turn lead to more anticipation for the next bite. I definitely would like to come back for the noodles, lunch specials, and other limited/special menu offerings. Highly recommended.\",\"Second time here and equally delicious! Hand pulled noodles are one of my favourites. The ones here are nice and chewy with a light and flavourful broth perfect for a chilly evening. We came on a Friday evening so this time we didn't have a long wait. Staff here are super friendly and they have some English speaking staff which will be helpful for those of you who can't speak Chinese. I can't remember exactly what we ordered but I included photos for your reference. Everything was really good if you're craving some northern Chinese flavours. I'm not super big on the numbing spice but this place adds just enough to the sliced beef dish that leaves you craving more. If you're looking to try more than a bowl of noodles just order one, it's enough for two people! We had a bowl of noodles, sliced beef pancake sandwich (see photo bc I can't remember what it's really called), and the spicy beef. We left fully satisfied and stuffed. Enjoy!\",\"Was looking forward to eating here for some time. My cousin and I ordered the sampler for 2 and had no complaints! The ribs were tender and fall off the bone with a great texture and wonderful char. The other noteworthy item was the mac and cheese. The 4 year old white cheddar provided a velvety smooth texture I haven't had in years.Ambiance and service were excellent.4 stars indeed!\",\"I came in with a group of 8 people. We were quickly seated after a few moments at the bar. The night ambiance is very different than the day pictures described on their website. I enjoyed it. We got the Schweinshaxe, Brussel Sprouts, and Sauerkraut Fritter w/ a Donut beer and Hefeweizen. Schweinshaxe was delicious. A crispy delicious pork that easily feeds 2 people. I loved the excessiveness of it. I had seen someone eating one in Germany over this past summer and loved having the opportunity to have one myself. The Brussel Sprouts were sweet. The amount was just right for the two of us. The Sauerkraut Fritters were light and tasty.The Donut beer was a spontaneous decision. Right before I made it I was tasting a few different beers with the bartender we had. It was the right choice. We followed it with the Hefeweizen for what I'd imagine a classic German bier. Great environment filled with friendly hosts, delicious food, and tasty beer. All of my friends had a great time during our dinner.\",\"Playa Cabana is about a 15 minute walk from my office and I hadn't planned on going there but the person I had an appointment with nearby wasn't available so I decided to have lunch first.Walking in, it's a very narrow, small space, almost claustraphobic. The dim lighting didn't help but it set an intimate mood for the place. This looks like a nice neighbourhood watering hole and the immediate neighbourhood is mostly residential.I ordered the Tostadas with beef and it was served on a crispy tortilla, topped with lettuce, guacamole, black beans, and a few other ingredients.The presentation was nice and the taste was even nicer! With layers of ingredients, every bite revealed a different flavour and texture and they all worked well together. Delicious!There were four different sauces on the table, with varying degrees of heat. I tried them all and they were all good.I may just have to make this walk more often.\",\"A great place to grab Katsu and unlimited refills of miso soup!My friends and I came in at around 9PM today and we were seated by the windows due to the lack of space to accommodate us. After twenty minutes or so, they let us move to a table where all three of us could sit and talk comfortably (Don't remember the names of these dishes 100% so please bare with me!)We got the pork loin original katsu while my other friend ordered the curry tender katsu. The curry definitely had a strong taste to it unlike the original, and I found to like it more since I'm a huge fan of strong curry. I also found that the pork loin was a lot more tender than pork tender... which sounds odd at first, but I highly recommend the pork loin over the pork tender. The pork loin was soft enough to be cut by a spoon!Unlimited refills of miso soup are always great. Despite multiple requests from my table for it, the waiters never hesitated to give more to us. I felt like I was treated very well during my visit here!Some tips:- they do not accept credit card, but they do accept Apple Pay!- all tonkotsu sets come with free refills of miso soup (so ordering an appetizer won't get you the soup)- the seats aren't designed in a way to hold your jacket, but they do have racks on the side-\",\"I have been going to the same Thai restaurants in Toronto (eg Pai, Sabai Sabai, Thai Basil) and decided to try something new.. and boy was I pleasantly surprised! I ordered the Panang chicken and my friend ordered the beef Khao Soi. The flavours of both dishes were phenomenal. The menu says the Panang curry is spicy but I felt it was pretty mild (considering that I do not take heat well). We ordered the ice cream dessert dish that they had and we did not feel that it was worth the price. We also tried the dark roast Thai ice tea which tasted like grass jelly... if you're looking for the flavours of a traditional Thai ice tea I would not suggest it. Only half their tables were filled on a Wednesday night --I prefer this because it allowed for conversation to take place at a comfortable noise level. Overall the waiter was attentive and the food was really good! I will not think twice about coming back!\",\"Amazing. The bartender with the glasses is great. The food is yummy. Best place for Mexican food!!!!\",\"The name means a traditional sort of Portuguese riverboat. It is a reflection of the atmosphere and food that is found in this restaurant. (A little out of place with the chi-chi other restaurants surrounding it, but actually probably more worthwhile!)The wine list is inexpensive, full of interesting Portuguese wines that one would otherwise not normally sample. (If you want to bring your own there is a $15 corkage). We had an Allo Albarino which was delicious, minerally and fresh, rather like a rich Vino Verde.We were given some fat thick olives and some good bread which was cold but otherwise fine.Our octopus was hot, great, on a bed of pickled onion, very soft and tender, and plenty of it. \\\"It is one of the signature dishes of the restaurant\\\".The Greek salad was standard, lots of crisp lettuce but rather light on the other ingredients.Our sea bream was on a bed of garlic and beautifully cooked but not deboned ; plenty enough to share for two. Very worthwhile.Our lamb chops were also great, grilled well, with still the stripes of the grill on the flesh, mushrooms and bacon accompanying them, lovely.French fries crisp and hot.Service very attentive, informative and interesting.Overall, an underestimated little gem in this hothouse restaurant area.\",\"Find this place with the cute neon sign out front. Came here before a show at the Opera House and it was such a good choice, can't wait to come back!Drinks: They have an extensive beer list, with rotating specials. They also have a good variety of cocktails. I'm a wine drinker and they have a number of bottles available at great prices! ($35-$55). Food: A lot of great appetizers to share and a few mains. We had the nachos which were delicious. Can't wait to try the jalapeno poppersService & Ambiance: Amazing music, cool vibes and friendly service. Can't ask for more.\",\"This is place is super tasty! It was busy so be prepared to wait, if you're solo you should get a bar spot right faster.A word of warning though, if you don't do spicy go mild. Medium was too hot, this place does traditional Thai spice. The food was excellent but a little different than I remember in Thailand, which doesn't mean it's not good but it was different. I ordered the Massaman curry which was more tamarind than I expected; however, it still tasted great. And just for a throw back I ordered a Singha. There were so many things I wanted to try, it's too bad there wasn't a tasting menu.I'd definitely go back and try a few more things. There is also a cocktail bar upstairs that looked fantastic.\",\"TIP#1: Check out the floor seated traditional room! But you HAVE to reserve & request this in advance!TIP#2: Their $5 Sake bombs are super fun! \\u00a0How to do the Sake bomb...1) balance the Sake shot glass between the chopsticks on top of the cup of beer2) once you're ready, the staff will make a ruckus and do the 'Sake bomb' chant with you & your friends3) after the chant you immediately use your hands to rumble the table to make the Sake shot glass drop into the beer. 4) CHUG CHUG CHUG! //SERVICE//This was my 2nd time at the Kinka Izakaya chain, but 1st time at this Bloor location. The servers were super great. Since it was my friend's birthday, they helped me hide the birthday cake. The energy from the Kinka staff is seriously unmatched whenever we have a birthday celebration or ordering Sake bombs ! //THE FOOD//Their izakaya pub foods are consistently great. I got my old favourites of Okonomiyaki (4/5), chicken karaage (5/5), ebi mayo(4/5), takoyaki (5/5), & karubi (4/5). It can add up to be very expensive but when you're sharing each dish with 2-3 people, it's much more reasonable ! Be careful with ordering their alcohol though! My friends ordered a small bottle of Mikan Shochu & didn't realize it was $41! Since Shochu is a liqueur similar to the alcohol content of vodka, sip it slowly !\",\"Driving along Dupont on a Saturday evening, saw this neat little place while stopped at a red light and decided to pop in for dinner. We sat on the patio and was greeted by super friendly staff immediately. Drink order was taken right away and was quite pleased with the beer selection. The menu was on a chalkboard which was nice and simple and our super informed server was able to answer the million questions I always seem to have while trying to make the best decision for my meal! We started with a couple of appetizers of twice baked beets and venison tartare. Wow. The flavors on each dish were incredible, and both were super fresh. For our mains my Mr. decided on the burger and I had the short rib pasta. Sooo good! His burger was sloppy, but we were warned! My pasta was perfect. Noodles cooked just right and the beef was crazy tender. The reason for the missing star was for the weird plastic outdoor chairs and the steep stairs to get to the basement bathroom! Nothing to do with the food or the service.\",\"I'm in love! Must-order items to devour: 1. The \\\"Loosey\\\" (unreal)2. The poutine (omg!) 3. Buffalo Tofu (this was actually insane and I don't even like tofu)4. Bulgogi Cheesesteak Must-order drinks:1. The Chinatown Cocktail (I don't recall its full name)2. Cucumber SojuI personally didn't love the kimchi fried rice we ordered. That's not too say that it wasn't tasty cause it was, but the taste was not as explosive as the other dishes we tried . Wait was about 1.5h for a party of 7. We ordered family-style and bill came up to 36 dollars per person which included four rounds of soju for the table and two cocktails. Highly recommend!\",\"Located just below Alo, the #1 restaurant in Canada at the moment, Aloette is Patrick Kriss' more relaxed, low key restaurant with a retro diner feel, lower price point and surprisingly generous portion sizes while still maintaining the same great service and quality as its sister restaurant. We dined as a party of three and were so stuffed that we had to pack some of it home.To start we were offerred complementary homemade cheese bread. I absolutely loved the bread as it was not overly cheesy (the cheesey bits seemed to be on the crust only and the bread itself was light and fluffy. It came with yeast butter which was rich, buttery and delicious.For appetizers, we had the Beef Tartare ($14) and the Scallop Tostada ($14). Topped with a creamy horseradish and dijon sauce and then covered with capers, scallions and warm crispy fried onions, the tartare was a delicous mix of tangy and savoury. The beef was fresh and not too ground up making it perfect for spreading onto the gem lettuce leaves that accompanied the dish. I really liked the different textures in this appetizer. The crispy lettuce and fried onions really added a nice crunch and freshness to the beef tartare. And to top it all off, the portion size was quite generous - more than enough for three people to share.The Scallop Tostada was also extremely tasty. The homemade tostadas were light and crispy. They were then topped with Hamachi sashimi, diced Granny Smith apples, pickled pearl onions, jalape\\u00f1o and cilantro resulting in a tangy sweet burst of flavour. One order comes with three tostada - perfect for a light snack!For our mains, we had the Aloette Burger ($18), the Roasted Pork ($20) and the Ribeye Steak ($36). The the juicy burger comes sandwiched between two house made buns and is topped with sauteed onions, shredded lettuce, cheddar cheese mayo and fried Beaufort cheese. On the side, there's a pile of addictive double-cooked fries, a pickle, and the tangy dressing which has a bit of a kick at the end. The fries were incredibly good and we were told that it takes two days to make since they need to soak the potatoes overnight in order to remove the starch and sugars required to make the perfect crisp fry.The ribeye was rich and buttery and glazed with a chimichurri sauce. The fresh, slightly spicy, garlicky and citrusy sauce really brought out the deep earthy flavours of the beef. The steak was topped with few saut\\u00e9ed shishito peppers which added a grassy, smoky and citrusy component to the dish. To finish off the plate, there was another generous serving of fries.My favourite of all the main dishes was the Roasted Pork. It had a good fat to meat ratio and was extremely juicy and tender. The pork was the topped with , saut\\u00e9ed esacarole, chopped cerignola olives, and nduja (a spreadable mixture of pork, fat and chilli) resulting in an amazingly earthy, zesty and spicy flavour combination. A must have!As sides we added on the Brussels Sprouts ($9) and Aloette Fries ($9). You know a restaurant is great when they make Brussels Sprouts that you can't stop eating even when you're super full! They might not be much to look at but this would be the one dish that I would definitely order again and again. The\\u00a0Brussels Sprouts were roasted beautifully so that they were soft and tender on the inside but perfectly\\u00a0browned one the outside with lots of loose leaves that are nice and crispy. The sauce was a tangy sweet maple gastique with chopped\\u00a0walnut and whole mustard seeds giving it some interesting textures. The flavours were a\\u00a0mix of tangy and savoury with a little bit of sweetness from the roasting. Absolute perfection! The acidity of this also really helps to cut through the richness of the other dishes you may order!The Aloette fries with smoked gouda hot sauce and jus, was the one dish we could have done without. Because the fries were covered with the melted creamy gouda, it overpowered the delicious fries themselves and made the fries less crispy. I think I actually preferred the fries on their own. The flavour to me was actually a little mild and I had difficulty detecting the smokiness of the gouda.For dessert, we tried the\\u00a0Lemon Meringue Pie ($10). Personally, I found this just ok (but keep in mind that lemon meringue is usually not my dessert of choice).\\u00a0 The lemon flavour really came through in the pie and the filling was actually quite tart. I was impressed with the meringue which had a nice subtle lemon flavour and the sweetness of the torched marshmallows helped to balance out the tartness of the pie. Probably a good choice who prefer tart desserts.\",\"The restaurant is pretty small and very popular, so I recommend going early. We had to wait for a seat (I think we were there around 11:30-12 on a Sunday), but it wasn't too bad, I expected a longer wait. The seating is a bit squished, so be prepared to get comfortable with your neighbours. The service was courteous and friendly and the vibe is casual/hipster. I tend to prefer more space while I eat, but as soon as my food came, I stopped caring because it was 100% worth it. I got the eggs benedict with brisket and potatoes. It was amazing! Every single bite was packed with rich, delicious flavour. It was the perfect amount of brisket to bread/egg ratio and my egg was delightfully runny. I don't know what they put on their potatoes but it was like crack.Definitely ask for hot sauce on the side, but only if you REALLY like spice. The server said \\\"be careful, it's super hot\\\" and I was thinking \\\"hah, sure ooookay,\\\" but it actually was really spicy, so be aware and don't scoff like I did!\",\"Well deserved 5 star rating.My wife and I love this place !!Great food , staff and atmosphere !\",\"I rarely come to this area so I never thought I'd get to try this restaurant. \\u00a0I saw it while passing by and thought, I'm just gonna go! \\u00a0I had a lunch special with the $3 add on (I really enjoyed my ginger tea). \\u00a0The dressing on the salad was a little heavy handed and spread to my spring roll. \\u00a0Boooo. \\u00a0My rice noodles were great! \\u00a0Full flavours and definitely reminded me of Thailand. \\u00a0I asked for spicy and they did not disappoint. \\u00a0I will admit, I wasn't too fond of having to pick out the pieces kaffir lime leaves but they certainly added to the taste. \\u00a0Overall, a nice uptown option for Thai.\",\"Great atmosphereGreat serviceWell done bbq Salmon and garlic bread my fave!Take your friends and have an amazing time\",\"Note: This review is only for the boulangerie. I came here during the Christmas market and was intrigued by it's patterned foyer. One thing for sure: the people who decorated this place sure knew what they were doing. To the left, to the left, the bou-lan-ge-rie is in the room to the left. This is a French pastry shop that is in front of the Bistro. It was a warm tiny shop with a pretty good system in place from the door for crowd-control reasons I suppose - one way in, one way out. What caught my eye were the croissants and then the tiny French pastries just beside the cashier ($3.5). Of course, I went with the Mocha \\u00c9clair because why would I get a croissant? Maybe next time as a way to compare with the croissants at other places and Pillsbury ones. The pastry was smaller than the palm of my hand. Although it was not big in size, the looks made up for it (I promise I'm not always this shallow). Overall, my experience was very pleasant as soon as I stepped into the shop and when I left. Since I came during the Christmas season, it may have been busier as opposed to a visit in the summer or after the New Year.\",\"Great Vibes, Great BBQ, and Great times. Cherry St BBQ has impressed me several times. I always leave happy and satisfied. I've had the Brisket & Pulled-Pork Sandwich. I've also had the Double Stack Cherry Mac-Burger. In terms of sides, I've tried the Mac & Cheese and Home fries. I also gave the sausage a try. I have to say the Pulled Pork Sandwich was my favourite. The meat is juicy and flavourful from the smoke. In terms of sides, I would go for the Home Fries. If you go, try the Sausage. It has that nice snap and with each bite you are getting a burst of flavour. Keep Eating, Angela\",\"Peruvian here. We love this place. I come here once a week, sometimes more lol The food is just how we eat back at home, including the presentation. It's delicious home made food. I don't go there for the decor, just the delicious food. It's a family run restaurant.\",\"Portions are generous and the service and food is really damn good. Would recommend the rice with coconut, peanuts served with the lettuce to make lettuce wraps. It's been a while since I've had a dish that has blown me away like that. A++++ would come back in a heartbeat!\",\"Ratings:Food: 9/10Drink: 7/10Service: 9/10Value: 9/10Hygiene: 7/10Aesthetics: 7/10The last time we came here we were craving Korean bbq but the wait was over an hour, so we decided to go elsewhere. This time we decided to stick out the wait. It was still an hour wait (on a Sunday night).The menu here is simple, and you do most of the cooking, so if the food is bad, it's probably your fault. We ended up getting the pork belly, pork jowl and beef skirt steak. The side dishes were good. It came with the steamed egg and 2 soups. The kimchi was fermented well and taste was just right. The pork belly, jowl, and the skirt steak were all great cuts and very tender. We got a bottle of makgeolli to drink. There's not much selection, but with a place like this, the smaller the menu the more catered it is for the food.The service here was pretty quick and friendly. The wait was the only thing that, unfortunately cannot be improved unless they get a bigger location.The decor and atmosphere is pretty plain and simple. They have decor for a classroom and the seats and tables are barrels, very similar to an outdoor bbq place in asia.The prices are reasonable. The plates of pork were ~$16-17, while the beef was ~$25This place has good food, but if you're not patient, you won't have a chance to eat here.\",\"this is the place!!! i can not describe a better place to go for some great Katsu! the service is amazing! the food is amazing! the whole atmosphere is amazing! this is the place i just keep coming back too and i don't plan on stopping!\",\"We were having a pretty decent night already, but Goods & Provisions took it to the next level.As others have mentioned, the music and ambiance were great. Service was crazily friendly for such a cool place. Happy hour deals were a nice surprise - we opted for a half-price bottle of wine which was definitely a good look. Someone previously mentioned that the serving size of the Bone Marrow was small, but they must've had bad luck, or the restaurant read their review and stepped up their game because ours was a hearty-sized portion, able to quell even my unrelenting thirst for the beefy goodness of internal bone matter.Oysters were also great, fresh of the boat from P.E.I.Overall great vibe, great food, great service and great prices. If we lived in Leslieville this would be our go-to spot. Will definitely be back in the future.\",\"Definitely a 4 star restaurant! Firstly, this place is absolutely beautiful, the restaurant seems massive, it has high ceilings but still achieves a warm and romantic atmosphere. The ambiance is really great, especially on a cold night, you feel like you've been transported to a cool vacation spot. The food is also really good!We ordered a number of dishes, and I wasn't particularly disappointed in any of them, but some were definitely better than others. The ambiance, like I noted was excellent, but on an absolutely freezing night we were seated very closely to one of the entrances and the breeze kept hitting us every time someone opened the door, which was quite frequent. We had asked to move but they mentioned that they were totally booked up so we were out of luck. I think they should opt to not let people sit there on nights like that since it was quite uncomfortable at times. After we started eating and drinking it was definitely less of an issue however. We ordered just about half the menu it seems but some highlights were: the pan con manchego, the selection of meats, beef tartar, the Croquetas de Setas, the queso frito, the lamb chops, the rib eye, scallop paella, and for dessert, the curros and semifrio. Some items I could probably take or leave were the wagyu meatballs and the patatas bravas. Not bad, but not super memorable. The rib-eye and the croquetas were the highlight for sure and for dessert, the semifrio was amazing, full of flavour and texture! The food is all beautifully presented as well as fresh tasting, with an expert focus on bold flavours and textures. We also ordered some wine and sangria and they were all great! The reason for the 4 stars instead of the 5 is the price point. I really can't understand the justification for the high prices and tiny portions. For a group of 5, you'll probably need to order 2 or more of each menu item for everyone to try one piece. For the most part, the tapas have 2/3 pieces of food per order so it can get expensive when you start order 2-3 of each item. It's definitely not for the faint of wallet but it's an experience to try at least once or on a special occasion. The service was very good. Our drink glasses were filled regularly and the server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the food, which was good as this was a new experience for me. He let us try a few wines before ordering a glass which was also a nice touch. I've never had spanish wine but everyone seemed to enjoy theirs. The sangria was delicious. Overall, I'd probably only come back if someone was footing the bill, I'd be hard pressed to spend what it takes to get full at this place, even though it's exceptionally good. If I won the lottery though, this would be one of my first choices for dinner!\",\"The food and atmosphere overall is great. It did seem more intimate / more suitable for one on one dining and drinks, I did not see many groups of friends at a table. My first experience with Insomnia was through food delivery. I wanted to come in and experience the full package so my boyfriend and I had reservations for a Saturday night. We were greeted and seated immediately, right by the windows facing Bloor st. The restaurant was dim and romantic, but the street lights coming in added a nice touch to the ambience.Our server, Raza (not sure how to spell her name, sorry!!), was very friendly and informative. We ordered everything she recommended and we loved every dish. She also mentioned how their Old Fashioned is more traditional, and how they have a regular who comes in exclusively for the old fashioneds. I've had my fair share of Old Fashioneds and this is one of my favourites (they use 1 big square cube of ice rather than regular ice cubes!).To start we ordered the mussels, and Raza recommended we get their complimentary bread to dip. The bread isnt listed on the menu with the dish as the mussels are noted gluten free, but it is a very highly recommended option! The mussels were soo good, and didn't have any grimey seafood scents or flavour. The sauce the mussels were soaked in was creamy, but not overly rich. We also tried the calamari, and it was good, but the mussels were my favourite out of the two.For our entree, my boyfriend was debating between chicken and waffles or their spicy penne. Our server mentioned the owner of Insomnia is also the co-owner of Dirty Bird, so the chicken and waffles are the same recipe. He immediately chose the chicken and waffles. I heard Insomnia is known for their signature Insomnia burgers, but I was in the mood for pasta. Raza said the rose sauce shrimp linguine was her favourite, so I went with that. I highly recommend the shrimp linguine with rose sauce, especially if you're hungry. The portion was huge, and I really wanted to keep eating it but I couldn't finish. I got a second drink after my old fashioned, called Smoking Gun. It wasnt too sweet, nor tasted overwhelmingly of bourbon. It was a luxurious orange chocolate cocktail with an even better aftertaste, and I love how they fill the beverage up to its rims!I would say Insomnia is the perfect date night spot, or a great place to enjoy a cocktail or two (they also have a long list of intricate cocktails + the usual beer and wine) catching up with your friends.\",\"We were craving lobster roll one night - Yelped some options and 30 minutes later were seated at Lobster Monster checking out the menu!We ordered the cold lobster croissant and the lobster grilled cheese. Both got a bit soggy but definitely hit the spot to satisfy our cravings. The grilled cheese was better than the croissant - would for sure order it again.\",\"Koyoi (meaning 'tonight') is one of the earlier izakaya in Toronto by now and staffed with Japanese waitresses and has many Japanese customers, but the owner (whose wife is Japanese) is Korean. The food is quite good and coupled with everything else that makes up a pleasant dining experience and atmosphere is a 3.5/5.The izakaya's second location opened, changed names, reverted back and has shut down now so the owner has not perfected a formula, but the food is generally good (though not as tasty as in Japan) and there are a couple of rare menu items that no one else offers like motsunabe, which we ordered. This hot pot dish is made with the innards of cow or pig and adds chive, sesame, tofu, cabbage and garlic. Theirs was good, but missing flavour compared to Japan a little and definitely missing 'motsu' or offal. We were disappointed by how little meat there was in the nabemono.The gyutan or beef tongue on a hot stone is a favourite and quite good, the blowtorched saba battera is tasty and who can say no to Japanese karaage?They have a variety of sake and shochu. The service is fine and responsive. The food items arrive fairly quickly. Water refills is regular.They are always busy, which means that most people do not care about the lack of atmosphere or decoration, which is what I wanted to get into next. The L shaped izakaya is quite small, tables are next to one another and there is minimal decoration past product posters, bottles and of course signs advertising food. The washroom had its 'best before' date in 2014 probably and could use a major overhaul.At least they had not turned on the TV.Koyoi would be an A if it had a nicer interior and refocused on more authentic Japanese flavours for certain items, but as mentioned earlier is still a winner.\",\"Tilt is a super chill and casual arcade bar that has a great selection of retro gaming machines! All of their games are free to play as well, so there's no need to search for the change machine. Just pay the $5 cover fee and play until your heart's content =) The arcade selection has many of your classics from the 80's and early 90's, and includes titles such as Pacman, Donkey Kong, Street Fighter and the like. They also have a good selection of pinball machines which were all in good working order. Despite the high usage of their games, every arcade cabinet was well maintained and worked smoothly. A great thing to see since most of these things are rare treasures now =)Tilt also has a huge selection of beers and drinks on their menu, with the average pint costing only $7. The food here seemed popular as well, though I didn't get to try any of it on my first visit.Overall, a great place to grab a drink and experience some nostalgia with old school games! Best to come early on weekends if you want to avoid lineups though-the place gets packed and lively at night =)\",\"This place is a hidden gem !!!Love the atmosphere of this restaurant and of course the food is amazing !!We had:-dyno wings- salmon Aburi- okra- uni bombIf possible, you should try everything on the menu lol. Everything we had was so yummy.The dyno wings are a must-try, it's chicken wings stuffed with dumplings. If you like okra- you must order this dish. It's seasoned so well and very tastey!!This restaurant is pretty busy and i don't think they take reservations. I came here on a Monday night and it was pretty packed.I definitely recommend this restaurant if you have not been here yet.\",\"I went in October 2017 and for New Year's eve, and the food was amazing! The Creekstone Farm Prime Black Angus-KS, USA Aged 45 days, Mishima Reserve Wagyu-CO, USA Tenderloin and the A5 Black Tajima-Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan Tenderloin steaks were so tender and to die for. They make the ceasar salad in front of you, you know your salad is fresh. The European Sea Bass was crispy and flaky. Really good. The truffle fries are so good and you gotta order it. The bread that they serve is huge...it looks like a big muffin. The servers are really nice. This resto never disappoints! I'm always beyond impressed with the food and service whenever I go. I'm a client for life!\",\"We stopped here because my daughter was craving Mexican food. I had just finished my lunch so I didn't participate.She ordered soup and three tacos which came with a drink. She was expecting a little bowl of soup and what was served was big an hearty, filled with beef, chicken and chick peas. She couldn't stop eating it and had to take two of the tacos home because she couldn't finish. I'll be going back for sure so that I can sample the food myself. The proprietor was friendly and helpful and the place was cute and cozy.\",\"Seriously, you really can't go wrong with ordering anything on the menu.Here's an example. My wife doesn't like Kale, period. Our server, thankfully, was a good sales person, and convinced her to try the Kale salad. My wife likes it! They managed to get rid of the earthy taste of the Kale and gave it really good flavour. The steelhead we paired with was cooked perfectly.The pasta was fresh and just come together perfectly with the truffles.Then, the tiramisu. It is as authentic as I remember my Italian friend made it.\",\"Amazing food, delicious \\u00a0and worth the wait!!! Came here for a private party and will definitely come back forMore!!The Singaporean slaw abs the cheeseburger spring rolls are to die for!!!!!!\",\"I like this place. Can't wait to go again. I went here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon, but I've passed by on weekend nights and it appears jam packed!The atmosphere is relaxed and trendy industrial / wood decor. Small place. There was a long list of drinks but did not have any this time for lunch. I would try this again for evening drinks and snacks. So this review is based mostly on the food. Tapas like style, No utensils. The dishes that came out were delicious! A mix of flavors that blend well together and textures - Octo Bravas was what was recommended and it did not disappoint - the most tender octopus I have had and flavorful. The mushroom tuna hand roll was yummy as well, Argentinian beef was very tender and the scotch egg benny was tasty (though a bit to rich for me but my bf said it was his fav). The Korean fried chicken was good though for me, it was nothing outstanding. Prices of the tapas was reasonable to higher of course for sharing dishes but also reflect the yum factor.\",\"Wow! Amazing warm friendly service and delicious apps and Pizzas! Who could ask for more?We enjoyed the Zeppolinis - pizza dough wrapped prosciutto cotto, ricotta and mozzarella with their homemade pepper sauce on the side! So good.A focaccia like bread basket came out with balsamic and olive oil and the homemade spicy pepper sauce and a bowl of mixed olives. Delicious and free!The we each ordered a pizza - I don't now what we were thinking ! They were big. I had the prosciutto cotto and fungi Napoli and my husband had a Santa Lucia which had cherry Tomatoes, anchovies amd cappers. AmazingThen we shared some gelato and a latte all for under 90 before tip.Great place can't wait to go back with the family!\",\"Came here on a Saturday night around 8:00pm. Restuarant was pretty packed but luckily we got the last seats (so no wait time yay!) Small restaurant, can fit around 25people. Saw some people ordered takeout to go during our time eating. Here's what we had: Pad thai with chicken ($14.95) - I like it, good flavourMassaman curry with beef ($14.95) - not your traditional curry, it is on the sweet side and not spicy Chicken satay ($8.95) - 5 skewers covered with peanut sauce Overall food are good but a bit pricey.\",\"We loved this place!! Thank you Yelp and all your reviewers. We were in the area and used your app to make our decision . Great late lunch. Beef Cheek, shrimp and pork carnitas taco. We had to try the tempura squid tostadas . Glad we did. The aioli sauce and jalape\\u00f1o peppers balanced each other . The Pork carnitas had a lime cilantro initial flavor, then the pork flavors kicked in at the back of your mouth. Loved the Beef Cheeks taco. The brown sugar and savory flavors swirled in our mouth. The shrimp taco was very tasty. The Grand Electric Ale washed all the tacos down. The staff were so so helpful. We sat at the bar and received a lot of attention from the staff . Kudos .Can't wait until we're in the area again . Thank you Grand Electric and Yelp.\",\"This is a fantastic little osteria with a seriously good menu and a nicely-curated wine selection, I hear the pizza's great but it's hard to pass up those primi and secondi!The service is almost joyful, maybe not truly in the spirit of professional Italian restaurant service but very welcome just the same.Of course it's a great couples' place, but a four- or six- top is 'way more likely to enjoy digging into the wine list, so bring a couple of friends and have yourselves un ottimo momento, or something like that!\",\"4/5??? Are you kidding me?The grilled Caesar alone pushes this place past that!Great servers... very nice decor and soundtrack... and great food! Warm. Friendly. I'm a single late 50s guy that loves a good Caesar and I walk past a BUNCH of places to go here once every couple weeks.\",\"We had a late lunch at the Mill Street Beer Hall in the Distillery District. \\u00a0It was a busy spot so it's a good thing we had a reservation!Because the Toronto Christmas Market is going on, the restaurant is currently providing a reduced menu. \\u00a0I ordered Fried Chicken Forestiere (without the wild mushroom sauce). \\u00a0It was just okay. \\u00a0The two pieces of chicken were boneless and a bit on the small side. \\u00a0The chicken was tender but the outside was overcooked.\",\"A decent place to grab a quick bowl of ramen in the heart of downtown Toronto. Although not my favourite ramen joint, the spicy miso ramen is quite decent if you like your noodles on the stronger tasting side.I would rate this place higher but found the portion size of meat to be somewhat unsatisfying...so it does add up if you are a big meat eater like myselfOverall, a fan\",\"The building itself is an old house, and it felt very much like eating at the exquisite home of some very warm Italian family. The staff were kind, attentive but not hovering, and very easy to chat with not only regarding the menu but also in terms of small talk and general friendly conversation. We told them we had just gotten married a few days before and they allowed us to sit up on the top balcony by ourselves. It was incredibly romantic to just have the one table to ourselves up there with the red checkered table cloth and the chilled bottle of chardonnay, and a really unforgettable first date night as a married couple. Many thanks to the staff there for creating this experience for us. The food was excellent and we left very full and very satisfied. We live just up the block and will be making this a regular spot.\",\"Came here the first night in from the states. The food was pretty decent for a late night menu. The drinks were also pretty good. The ambience was really dead but it was late and the night before NYE so it was a quiet night. I feel like the food took a while to prepare but the waiter was really nice. \\u00a0A really pretty establishment\",\"a neighborhood go to for us...maybe its the addiction to the complimentary spice dusted popcorn.The menu is easy to navigate and delicious. \\u00a0Love the brisket and the wings are a must try. \\u00a0The potato salad option during lunch has a light flavour and one of our favourite sides,Ofcourse there are the ribs, but I'm impartial to the brisket and even have it with a bit of their mustard based bbq sauce on occasion. \\u00a0Definitely call ahead if you can to reserve a table or you \\u00a0might be in for a wait. \\u00a0Lots of street parking \\u00a0around and with Butcher bar just a few doors down, don't forget you can try that location that carries many of the same menu items!\",\"I love the Wallflower.My dining companion used to live in the area, so we often found ourselves showing up for just a quick drink or even a full-fledged meal. The dark, inviting ambiance works for just about any scenario, and I will admit I've missed the place since my aforementioned friend moved away.We decided to make our triumphant return a few nights ago and it was as though we'd never left. We even managed to secure our usual table near the door.Before we even got there, we both knew that one thing we had to order was the deviled eggs. These are standard deviled eggs with an always-changing roster of toppings. (On this particular night, the eggs were topped with cumin and another spice I'm forgetting.) Though they're not prepared to order - these clearly came out of a fridge - the eggs are perfectly cooked and the center is deliciously creamy. A must.I was also excited to order the Snack Nachos, as it's an item that pretty much became a staple for me during my many previous visits. It was saddening, then, to discover that the dish has grown considerably worse in the last few months (or perhaps the chef was having an off night). What was once an ooey, gooey mess of cheesy nachos has turned into a lazy, phoned-in dish that leaves way too many nachos without any cheese. (Nothing worse than a naked nacho, in my opinion.) I'll probably give this one another shot on a future visit, but I was definitely quite disappointed.We also decided to try one of their specials, a Brisket Stew. Despite the fact that it was really more of a soup than a stew, we quite enjoyed this dish. It's got a deep, delicious flavor that's heightened by an assortment of tasty ingredients, including a very generous serving of soft, tender brisket and a good helping of bread (which is perfect for sopping up the rich sauce).I should also point out that the service was, as always, excellent. I had a question about one of the beers on tap, and the waitress offered to bring me a small glass to try. Now that's what I call going above and beyond.\",\"Came by this place by accident and oh boy are we glad we did! We were served by lovely Helen.... thank you HELEN!If you are a seafood lover and appreciate the experience look no further. The food is so delicious and the service is world class.\",\"Not sure why the prices suddenly went up, and now they're a little out of my price range for frequent dining. It's really too bad because I loved coming here. Absolutely amazing vegan restaurant. I love their brunch and Sunday mornings is usually when I will be there. The smoothie bowl is to die for. A little secret, their smoothie bowl recipe is on their blog. I make it a few times a week. But yeah, still come in for the real deal, ambiance, and amazing juices.\",\"This is by far my favourite Italian restaurant in Toronto. It has a rustic dimmed setting and very polite staff. My boyfriend and I began with appetizers: Calamari & Octopus (cannot remember the Italian name to save my life). The calamari was very light which made eating a lot of it enjoyable and the octopus came with grilled potatoes and zucchini. Moving onto the mains, the pasta we ordered were handmade within the restaurant. Our dishes were accompanied with extravagant, unique flavours that definitely sets the tone for Nodo. The Caramel Bread Pudding was our dessert choice and wasn't overwhelming and contained just the right amount of sweet and tasty. Overall great experience, great staff and amazing food!!! Looking forward to coming back!\",\"I've been to The Carbon Bar many times. I love the high ceilings and vibe. I am usually there for drinks (love the black mamba margarita) and the Korean Fried Cauliflower is the best in the city. This city loves it's brunch and The Carbon Bar recently joined the Brunch Wagon. I went there a few weeks ago and was throughly impressed. My friend and I had no problems getting a table, we sat down and obviously ordered some caffeine. The coffee is nothing special, tastes like a regular drip coffee. We then proceeded to order; Huevos El Carbon, Smoked Brisket Benny, Smashed & Fried Potatoes, and the Buttermilk Pancakes. The server told us they ran out of the Brisket for the Benny but they could add Pulled Pork, I had zero problems with that as I prefer Pulled Pork over Brisket. About 20 minutes later and all of our food arrived. WOW. It was a LOT of food. We were excited to dig in. I took one bite of my Pulled Pork Benny and fell in love. This had to be the best Eggs Benny I had ever had. It reminded me of a pulled pork sandwich, it had pickles, slaw and chili. The biscuit was a great southern touch. I wish they would add it as a permanent item on the menu. The Huevos was okay, it came with warm tortillas, black beans, two eggs sunny, Manchego cheese, chorizo, guacamole, and charred pico de gallo. I personally didn't feel like it was anything special. The Smashed & Fried Potatoes were amazing. It had kimchi and fried onions. The potatoes were cooked then smashed on a griddle so it had a nice crispy yet chewy edge. Finally dessert, The pancakes were pretty good. We obviously had to add the smoked bacon. The pancakes were a bit dense, and I wish they added the blueberry sauce to each layer, overall it was good. I would definitely recommend this place for some good southern brunch. It's the ultimate comfort food. Keep Eating, Angela\",\"Great place for a dinner date! Food 4/5: We started with the Parmigiana di Melanzane, which is basically an eggplant parm. The tomato sauce was flavourful with fresh basil and the eggplant perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I was disappointed at the amount of burrata cheese they gave but they did give a fair bit of ricotta. Next we shared the Bigoli, the sauce was rich and flavourful however the noodles were a bit too al dente for me, it was more like they weren't cooked properly. Then we had the Gnocchi Ripieni, and although you only get 6 pieces, its pretty heavy as each piece is stuffed with cheese.The dumping skin is so soft, you almost can't tell where the skin ends and the cheese begins. For dessert we shared 2 scoops of gelato (white chocolate cranberry and chocolate) and one scoop of sorbet (blood orange beet). The sorbet was by far my favourite - it almost tasted like strawberries and was so light and refreshing, the perfect way to end the meal! The white chocolate cranberry was also very nice but I found the chocolate to be nothing special (however my partner loved it and it was his favourite). My only suggestion would be for them to use chilled glass or metal plates as the ice cream melted fairly quickly on the ceramic. \\u00a0Drinks 5/5: I ordered the BarBuca (I hope that's right, I can't find their cocktail menu online to confirm), a beet infused vodka drink and was immediately blown away! I had to order a second! The drink is sweet and cold, tastes like real beets. I also had a cappuccino which comes with a little piece of biscotti. Service 5/5: Our server was really nice, as it was our first time here she explained the menu to us and was great about us ordering one dish at a time as we wanted to share everything and relax during the meal. Our plates and cutlery were refreshed between every course and our water constantly filled. Atmosphere 4/5: The restaurant is smaller than I had pictured and the dinning room is split into 2 sections. One room is small and more modern looking with walls lined with wine bottles, the other room is bigger with very high ceilings and the walls are entirely brick.\",\"I've been coming here long before this place blew up, so definitely have been returning less often due to the long lineups. However, I have nothing but great things to say about the food here.I had the spicy red miso ramen, their signature menu item. In the past, I've always gone with the shio, but this is definitely my go-to now. Unlike other ramen, the chefs stir fry the vegetables under high heat before adding the rest of the ingredients into the bowl. This releases the fragrance and flavour of the vegetables into the broth! The noodles are also some of the best I've had in Toronto - they were bouncy and had great texture.The only gripe I have about Ramen Isshin is the tiny seating. We were seating in the middle of the restaurant, and it wasn't the most comfortable time putting away your coat and bag in such a small space.\",\"I got their BREAKFAST WESTERN ($12) and decided on this dish solely based on my hollandaise obsession haha. The menu offers many different types of toppings to go with their pierogis with the option of getting them fried or steamed. My fatass likes anything fried so, that was the obvious choice for me. I would definitely go back to try other combinations! @wheresmyhoneypot\",\"Literally a hidden gem! Concealed in the back corner of Longo's (... yes, seems weird, right?) is Corks... but I think it's genius!! I live across the street and have come here a few times - the service and food are always incredible. I usually pop in for a \\\"make your own\\\" za which include: your choice of sauce, cheese and three toppings. Unless you want to pick from one of their predesigned options, of course. The pizza comes perfectly cooked every. damn. time!! And boy are they quick!! Each time I've been, they've had some sort of special going on - I like to get the 'pizza and pint' deal. The bartenders AND kitchen staff are both very accommodating. They even charged my phone one time (I know this is annoying, so thank you). The bar itself has very little seating, but I've never had an issue...After another positive experience with Corks, I felt the need to get on here and give you guys five stars because you deserve it! Oh! And the cherry on top?! You can't beat the prices here! ... I selfishly hope that Cork REMAINS a hidden gem! :) ;)\",\"OK OK OKKKK if you like truffle go here. They have a bomb truffle pasta and an amazing wine selection! I also got the lamb chops which were delish. The veal was sold out when I went unfortunately! Really great staff.Two cons: hard to find parking (because of the new laws on king the little parking next to them is always full!) I got an espresso and it didn't come with a biscotti. Super small I know but I couldn't help feeling a lil biscotti with my espresso would've been the perfect touch to my meal.\",\"A trendy place located in the heart of the Financial District of Toronto at First Canadian Place. The indoor entrance is located at the First Canadian Place food court and it is conveniently connected along with the path. The design and menu made me think of Joey's for some reason.I came here with a big group as we sat up on the deck level which is the rooftop patio level. In the summer time, it must be nice with the roof open. However, during the winter season, it is covered up but not fully sealed so you can feel a cold draft at times. They have heaters on the ceilings but if you sit right below them, it can be very, very hot. We got to sit in one of the booths but I thought that a booth is a bit too small for a group of 7 people.I ordered the cajun chicken sandwich with fries. The food came out promptly and it is a great sandwich. It did not look filling at first but as I kept taking more and more bites, I am definitely wrong. The chicken is grilled and not fried which is great. The sandwich was topped off with age cheddar. The fries were also good. Overall, not a bad place to eat.\",\"\\\"I thought this was TO finest\\\" -FriendMy stomach was growling and I wasn't feeling Chinese or anything too \\\"grubby.\\\" I came here on a Thursday afternoon into a fairly empty store. Like any other downtown restaurant, the space ran deep despite its small storefront. The process works like this: order at the cashier, pay, take a seat, the servers bring you your meal. Levetto has a variety of pizzas and pastas. We ordered the Bucatini Pasta and the Pollo Toscano Pizza. The Bucatini contained guanciale, sauteed red onions, chilli flakes, and a spicy tomato sauce. The Pollo Toscano was topped with chicken, sundried tomatoes, tomato pesto, red onion, and fresh basil. After ordering, you collect your utensils - they had both metal and plastic cutlery. My friend and I sat right beside the window, the best spot in the house! I like how they brought us a pitcher of water and would refill it when it was empty. The food:-Bucatini pasta: crunch from the guaniacle (Italian cured pork, like prosciutto), pasta had a nice consistency and length per strand. The pasta was coated in a thick tomato sauce that had a perfect blend of spices. -Pollo Toscano: everything was good besides the fresh basil. It does look good (especially for photos) but personally, not a fan of eating it. I've visited their other locations and in general, I find that their stores are quite consistent with their dishes.\",\"Brunch like whoa.Had the pork belly breakfast sandwich ($8) and absolutely loved it.The homefries ($5) were well cooked and even the crispy dried up bits were still delicious.Even a simple order of the toast w/ blueberry compote ($4) took me to next level flavour experiences. Seriously can't believe I slept on this place as long as I did, it's a new favourite.\",\"Got the Cali's bowl with a substitute of spring mix instead and added pineapples for extra cost. I absolutely loved the number of fruits in their toppings selection and also their garnish variety as well! The fish and veggie base was fresh too. Only complaint is they were very heavy handed with the sauce, but it surprisingly didn't effect the overall goodness of the poke though! I would easily come back for their amazing poke (and fruit selection) but just request for less sauce (:\",\"Mamma Mia! Just like the way mama makes it back home. Authentic home made tasting pizza with a friendly neighbourhood vibe. You can't go wrong here.\",\"Archeo is easy to miss when you are visiting the Distillery District and not specifically looking for it - even though it is right at the main gate entrance to the district, the exterior of this restaurant is so low key that it can easily be mistaken as a gift/clothing shop of some kind. If you do give them a try, you'll find that it is quite a solid restaurant with very reasonable prices given it's at a touristy location.The restaurant has a casual, rustic Italian Trattoria look and feel to it. Service is prompt and delightful. Unlike other restaurants in the area, this place does not have a huge menu selection, but it is well-rounded and thoughtful. With me and 3 other companions, we were able to sample pretty much all of the appetizers and most of the secondi main dishes.The food here is contemporary Italian, so anyone who comes here expecting to taste classic home style Italian cooking would probably be disappointed. Presentation of the dishes here are great, and I found the flavours very interesting.Dishes we had for the evening:- Antipasti with local & house cured meats, housemade pickles, ferments, mustard and cracker- Cannelloni with Chianti braised rabbit, charred carrot puree, and burnt cucumber infusion- Fresh local greens with house ricotta and elderberry caper- Fritto Misto (Maitake mushroom, olive ascolone, dandelion and burnt cucumber emulsion)- Flatiron steak with potatoes, creme fraiche, beet, juniper and glace de veau (this was perfectly seared and was an absolute joy to eat)- Fazzoletti Ripieni with house made Italian sausage, seared Ontario mushrooms, fennel, kumquat and anise truffle nage (this was an awesome dish as well)- Farfelle with rapini, vanilla poached salsify, shallots, garlic confit, garlic pesto cream and preserved lemon- Pappardelle Bolognese with blisted vine tomatoes, white anchovies and smoked olive oil (my favourite pasta of the evening)- Branzino with pan fried sweet gale, crispy skin, brussel sprouts, dandelion greens and elderberry piccata- Piadini Manzo with beef bresaola, sunchoke puree, green olive, pistachio, smoked golden blyth goat gouda (much more interesting and tastier than a pizza!)- Apple cake with brown butter icecream and marsala cream (this was so good, especially the brown butter icecream!)- Vanilla buttermilk panna cotta - Bittersweet chocolate bar with cocoa nibs, raspberry sorbet and strawberry coulis (a very nice and balanced dessert)I truly appreciate Executive Chef Dyer's passion of trying to focus on using as much local ingredients as possible for his dishes. I was also delighted to know that most things are made/prepared in-house, which is always nice.Overall, I am definitely a fan of this place and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone visiting the Distillery District who wants to try good and reasonably priced Italian fare. Archeo is a popular event spot and could be closed for a private event, so reservations are highly recommended.\",\"Yes, it's good. \\u00a0It's really good!I've had BBQ from all over the US. \\u00a0This restaurant has some of the best!The beef brisket was tender and juicy. \\u00a0That corned beef brisket is really good. \\u00a0The sampler has enough food for two people to share, especially with the two side dishes.The mac and cheese has smoked cheddar. \\u00a0It need a little salt and pepper to kick up the flavor. \\u00a0Just add it at the table. \\u00a0Let's not forget the cornbread...delicious!If you are in Toronto, check this place out!!\",\"Have been a couple times and the food and drinks are great.The menu is large and has a pretty wide selection from chicken fingers to sushi. It is a bar atmosphere with above average food.They could use a few more TV's...\",\"When I'm looking for good but quick food I love coming to Wilbur! The first time I came here with a friend I was unsure about how good the food would be since it was supposed to be quick. But whoa it did not disappoint! Came back a few weeks later with my boyfriend who also enjoyed the fresh & tasty tacos! Ordered the Carne Asada, Baja Fish, Chicken Tinga and my favourite the Bulgogi beef taco!! As a salsa lova I really appreciate all the salsa & hot sauce selections!! It actually makes the experience better! Will definitely keep coming back!\",\"Glad I had the fried chicken. Really good. I couldn't touch it for 10-15 minutes cause it was so hot! Freshly made. Crispy skin reminds me of Popeyes chicken but better and not oily at all! Now I know better cause I ordered chicken at the stockyards and it was oily compared to this one.My sister had the burger. Was good. She found it rich. I don't know if they butter the bun or something. It was good but she couldn't finish it.Fries were awesome! But you have to like black pepper as it is sprinkled on liberally.Coleslaw was only meh. It was ok but nothing special.Worth going back for the chicken. I had their house sauce. Kinda reminded me or sirracha but better.I thought price was good $13 for 3 pieces of chicken with 1 side. Cost extra for the sauce though.\",\"WHAT TO TRY?!The beastwich!Full of flavor and chicken is crispy, this enough to fill your appetite if you're extra hungry. Gravy is extra thick with sausage bits inside as well! Can't complain the nice addition of a fried egg in the middle as well. We also had the pig ears (talk about being daring!) and it's crispy too. But I thought this was no special dish because the ears were a bit overfried and you'll hv to hv an appetite for pig hair because often times you'll see the hair on the fried ears. I don't think much plucking is done to get rid of the hair before they fry the ears. We ordered the French toast with duck confit garnished on top. The French toast on its own tasted alright but it's the combo with the sweet and salty which makes this dish interesting. You don't find this kind of combination at a lot of brunch places so it's worth the try!LAST TIP?!It's usually super packed here so beware of the wait times!! Perhaps try holding your spot the day of and specify the time you're coming in fifteen minutes before so they can mark your name down before you arrive. They can't seat more than 8 ppl per party in the restaurant so be wary of that. They also can't seat you if your full party has not arrived! So take note of that too!\",\"We're in Toronto on vacation and found this place thanks to Yelp! \\u00a0We love Indian & have sampled it in cities around the world. \\u00a0The interior is very nice and warm. The bar selection is extensive. \\u00a0The menu has lots to choose from & the food was very good! We had the Fish Pakora appetizer to start, delicious. Then I had the Paneer Tikka Masala & asked that it be prepared mild, because I'm a wimp. \\u00a0It came out too spicy for me, but was better after adding a side of raita to cool it down. My husband got the Dilliwala Butter Chicken. He prefers very spicy & this was only medium to his palate. \\u00a0So spice/heat levels can vary. Service was stellar until a large party came in, then there was a bit of scrambling to catch up. We were overall very happy with Aanch and recommend it!\",\"I went there first wanting to use their WiFi and turned out they don't have WiFi. But the food is so good I don't need it lol.The Katsu is the best I have ever had so far. The Pablo is crispy and the meat is tender. The rice has the right amount of consistency. The cabbage is fresh and sweet. I also like how they serve lemon water to compensate the richness of the pork. They did all I can ask for katsu, brilliant.\",\"If you're looking for a good spot to eat, catch-up, and capture Instagram-able (Instagrammable?) moments, this is the spot for you. The signature dish is their namesake, BBQ back cheese ribs. What are they? Baby back ribs smothered in a tangy bbq sauce (spicy optional), wrapped in stringy mozzarella cheese, tableside. At first, it's a bit mesmerizing watching your server approach the table with tongs and scissors to stretch cheese. But the fun of watching cheese pulls is pleasantly followed with bites of tender ribs and chewy cheese. A unique but delicious combo. They also have a newer chicken and cheese platter which features dark meat chicken in a saucier sauce... Not as obnoxious as wrapping ribs in cheese, but the chicken is juicer and less messy to eat.Also on the menu, appetizers like pork belly, wings, baos, etc. and bowls of udon or kimchi fried rice. Plenty of choices for anyone part of your group. James Cheese is easier for walk-ins on weeknights but often crowded on weekends (reservations are wise) so plan accordingly. Overall, it's certainly a good option when your dining with a group, are in the Chinatown area, and are looking for a dinner and a show.\",\"We found Lesley Jones courtesy of Yelp and while I saw some mixed reviews, our experience was outstanding. We went for a pre show dinner at 6:00ish so it was not very busy. The decor is very chic in an understated way that is welcoming from jeans to formal. The reception is super friendly. The staff was over the top accommodating. But we are here for the food and it was absolutely to notch. I started with the mussels followed by the beef brisket. My companion had the best salad followed by the risotto. \\u00a0Both were come back for more of the same good although there were more to tempt. I would highly recommend. I'm going back at the first chance.\",\"Have been here for lunch and dinner. Grew up in bbq country in the states and this by far the best bbq I've had since moving to Canada. Brisket and pork were tender and cooked perfectly. A very welcome addition to the neighborhood.\",\"The food is constantly changing, popular food stays on the menu longer, and the food is absolutely delicious. Toss in a selection of rare craft brews and you have an awesome experience. The food is tapas style if that is a game changer for anyone.\",\"Went there for a Saturday brunch. Firstly, let's just say that the interiors are what I imagine my sunroom to look like. That is if I ever buy a house in this crazy housing market. But a girl can dream. Now to the good, no great, stuff - the food is spectacular. We got pretty much everything off the menu, except regretfully, the bottomless mimosa. The best thing on the menu was definitely the French toast and maple pork belly, both of which can also be ordered as a side, so yay! The lemon zest on the avocado toast is divine. They even made the lettuce taste better. The servers are great and friendly. The place is a tad bit overpriced for the quantity, but certainly worth the buck.\",\"Amazing meal and absolutely delicious tapas! I came with a group of colleagues for a company dinner and ordered the tasting menu. \\u00a0Everything was so good... My only regret is not knowing what was on the menu so that I wasn't able to pace myself accurately for eating! By the time I was finished, I was able to roll myself home.We started off with grilled shishito peppers, olives, and marcona almonds. The peppers were soft but so flavourful. Next came a variety of cured meats and protein. There was the whitetail carpaccio with a dollop of blue cheese in the centre. There was also some jamon cured for four years, some chorizo, and some cheese (forgot the type). The jamon had a generous streak of fat, which really brought out the pork flavour. The chorizo, however, was heavenly. Absolutely excellent charcuterie! The dishes came with a side of bread, along with some very rich olive oil and salt for dipping. Everyone loved the bread, and we all had a bit too much...The whole fish ceviche came next. I believe it was a red snapper, and it was served with cucumbers marinated in a citrusy mayo-like sauce. I loved the tangy taste and stuffed myself with this dish. The fish was also perfectly fried - the collar was a beautiful crisp! Then came the sweetbreads and raw tuna. Having never eaten sweetbread before, I was surprised to learn that this is the veal thymus gland. It was breaded beautifully and fried, and was super juicy on the inside. The pickled vegetables added a pop of flavour and complemented the sweetbread perfectly. The raw tuna also provided a nice balance and soft cushion to the crisp sweetbread.By this time, I was getting full... But then! Then the foie gras was served. Chilled and grated foie gras was plated on top of sweet vegetables (forgot the type) and laid over the house made baguette. I am not kidding - the foie gras melted at the slightest touch! It was like eating a buttery, fluffy cloud. My lips were coated in natural glossy shine afterwards...Patatas bravas were served after, but I regret to say that I was so full by this time that I couldn't eat any. It smelled heavenly though. Stir fried garlic snow pea leaves mixed with mint and cilantro came soon, and I had so much of this! It was delightful, and reminded me slightly of the Chinese stir fried snow pea leaves. I was particularly fond of the salty parmesan cheese bits mixed in, as they really highlighted the flavour. There were also clams with house made tomato sauce, served with stir fried beans and salted cod. I loved the salted cod! It was fatty, but the tangy and sweet tomato sauce provided the perfect balance. I found that the flavour of the clams fell flat though.At this point, I was already stuffed. But... The whole octopus, one pound king crab legs, and ribeye were all served at once. I wasn't mad about the king crab legs; though meaty, the sauce was a little too much and overbearing. The steak was SO good. It was a little chewy and tough, but the flavour was on point. It was perfectly medium rare, and the crisp and sear on the outside was impeccable. The octopus, however, was my favourite hands down. I had a whole leg, and it was crispy with a slight grilled char. You could literally taste the fire charcoal taste from the octopus. Despite being so full, I just had to go for seconds.Finally, we finished with two desserts. Something similar to an apple crumble arrived - I believe it was poached pears with goat cheese. Not a fan of the salty cheese, but the fruit and crumble was delightful. There was also Basque cake with sherry cream... Though rich, it was creamy and warming.We had the sommelier choose the wine for us, and they chose the medium boded red, a Gonzalez-Byass, Finca Moncloa, 2012. It was velvety and smooth, and went down so easily. There was a distinct taste of oak and something richer, though I'm not quite an expert to place my finger on what it was. Really good!\",\"I went to Ichiriki Restaurant to try the soba menu and ordered the Ten Zaru Soba which is a cold soba for dipping in a sauce and comes with tempura on the side. It was SO good! The noodles have a great texture and are all uniformly thin. The sauce was a bonito/soy type sauce and came with green onions and freshly grated real wasabi on the side. I added them together and with the soba, it tasted really good. The tempura included two shrimps and a variety of vegetables. The batter had a lot of finesse and was incredibly light, it also came with a lime wedge and some togarishi salt on the side. Really delicious. My friend ordered the chirashi soba which is also cold but comes with the sauce already. It also had nice pieces of real crab, ikura and tamago that was cut the same size as the soba. The flavours were excellent as well from the bite I tried. We also ordered the oboro tofu to share on the side. Silky smooth, lovely clean taste. I really enjoyed this as well although for people who don't like tofu in general, I don't think they would appreciate this since this dish allows the flavour of the tofu to shine and it's not covered with a lot of additional flavour even though it has a sauce like the soba sauce as well. Service was nice, atmosphere was quiet and cozy. One thing to note is that this place is CASH ONLY. Btw, if people are looking at the photo of the menu that is posted here, please note that that menu is super old and it will differ when you go to the restaurant.\",\"The best meal of my year may have already happened! \\u00a0In January to boot! \\u00a0 Lots of reviews already for this place, so here's my 2 cents (I'm not a Toronto local - up from the States). \\u00a0FOOD: \\u00a01) \\u00a0You might not thing to try the AAA Sterling Silver Prime Rib. \\u00a0Do. \\u00a0OMG. \\u00a0Absolutely unreal - as good as any steakhouse. \\u00a0Just completely succulent and little to no fat - literally clean your plate. \\u00a02) Salmon Oshi Sushi - WOW. \\u00a0Incredible flavor and freshness. \\u00a0I'll be back for more of these! ATMOSPHERE:Trendy couples plus business people on work dinners. \\u00a0 We sat at the bar in the restaurant and it was centrally located and very comfortable. \\u00a0Great people watching. \\u00a0STAFF:Attentive and fun - they were always there when we needed them.\",\"Been getting the mad cravings for a proper English breakfast, and this place definitely delivered.The good:- Friendly staff - we came in and were made to feel right at home by a very friendly hostess who chatted with us, explained the background of this restaurant (the owners wanted to bring over British pub culture, and create a cozy spot for locals/regulars)- Lots of european football on TVs. - Comfy half-circle couch seating. - High ceilings, posh decor, very airy and nice natural lighting - English breakfast was delish. Beans and mushrooms were packed full of flavor, toast was perfectly toasted with butter.The other stuff:- Brunch was on the pricier side for my wallet (Well - you decide: $17 for a full breakfast, although other items like eggs benny start at $13.)- I'm not sure how I feel about Anne Boleyn, but there are a lot of pictures of her so *shrugOverall, really good comfort food and has a real chill vibe despite the posh interiors. Would definitely come back with friends.\",\"I went to this restaurant after searching for casual, but fun restaurants to visit in Toronto. I love tacos, so this seemed like a great option. The ambiance was a cool vibe. Loud club music mixed with a hip trendy taco joint was a cool combination. All the decorations and the lighting also attributed to this vibe. The prices were a little expensive, especially the margaritas. I ordered a watermelon one, and it was tasty, unique and delicious don't get me wrong, but a little over priced. You are paying for the atmosphere and he concept of a unique taco menu more than anything, but sometimes it is worth it. In this case I would say that is was. The location seemed a bit small and there was not good place to wait especially in the cold temperatures. Overall, it was really fun to try if you are looking for something different.\",\"I've been here about a half dozen times and have found their food and service to be consistent and excellent, especially for the great price! \\u00a0This has been my go-to with co-workers for lunch on Fridays and is filling, delicious, and easy on the wallet! \\u00a0The service is very quick, and the atmosphere and d\\u00e9cor makes me feel quite comfortable here.\",\"Delicious food and great atmosphere! Came here for dinner on a weekday between Christmas and New Years and it was packed. The restaurant is cozy and great for a girls night out or date night. The food is tapas style and great for sharing. My friend and I ordered a few dishes to share: beet dip, fish crudo, halloumi, fried chicken, saffron rice, and the seasonal fruit. Our favourites were the beet dip and fried chicken. The beet dip was made with yogurt and spice and served with housemade Turkish flatbread. The flatbread arrived warm and we ordered additional flatbread just to scoop up the remaining beet dip. The fried chicken was juicy and flavourful, the orange blossom honey drizzled on top was amazing (I wish they sell the honey so I can bring it home). We also tried two cocktails - Satie and Co. and English Basilica. Both were well crafted and tasted amazing. Overall, the service was good and we had a great time. Will consider coming back in the future to try other dishes and cocktails.\",\"i'm into this place. came here around 10:30am for Sunday brunch and there wasn't a wait- but maybe the rain contributed. i got the pork belly benedict and my dining guest got the korean fried chicken + waffles. the pork belly wasn't too fatty like some other brunch places, and offered amazing flavour to pair against the hollandaise sauce and the focaccia. both dishes were delicious- we both thought we'd be able to finish it off but i left some salad on my plate and he left some of the waffle. would come back if the menu changed- but otherwise, nothing else at the menu jumped out at me. it was quite a limited menu but for what they offer, they do it well.\",\"Love Bar Buca! Both times I've visited, I have walked away impressed with this off the beaten path gem of an Toronto Italian experience. The lattes they make put all other lattes to shame.Rich and creamy, and then topped with their signature sweetener, the Italian specialty crema, made from the froth of the espresso machine is, if your idea of heaven is drinking delicious coffee all day without ill effects, simply heaven.The brunch was undoubtedly perfect as well. If you are in the mood for a protein hit, the egg dish I had was fantastic. With so many cookie cutter coffee shops in the area ready to take your money, Bar Buca stands out as an enduring favourite.\",\"Color me impressed when you can make reservations for brunch. Although an asterisk should be denoted as they only serve brunch on Sundays (which I discovered when arriving on a Saturday without a reservation the first time I attempted to come here).That said, I was quite pleased with the experience when I made it in the doors.Damn fine chicken and waffles on their menu grabbed my attention. 3 pieces of chicken (1 thigh, 2 drumsticks if memory serves correct) on 2 pieces of waffle (aka half of a large waffle) with some syrup and a berry compote of sorts in the mix. I could've licked the plate clean it.Everything got good reviews, and from creeping on other tables meals I'll say the breakfast pizza and the Filipino breakfast options both looked quite good while unique.Drink selection was a bit less impressive, including $12 caesars and an unimpressive but adequate tap beer selections. On an atmosphere topic, I'll say that I like how the place has a darkness to the room, as since the ceilings are so tall here is actually keeps the place feeling cozy. All in all, a nice new addition to my Queen Street West brunch list!\",\"Good food, great atmosphere. Pricey for sure. For two people the bill came out to 150$ including tax and tip, no drinks. We had the cerviche to start, then eggplant, followed by sablefish, king mushrooms, and finally pork jowl. We were stuffed with the shared 5 plates.Favorite was the sablefish, melted in your mouth and so flavorful! Pork jowl was nice too but we were pretty full when it came out. Eggplant and king mushroom dishes were pretty unique and well seasoned. Cerviche was the only so so dish.Service impeccable.\",\"Decided to go here because I was craving Filipino food plus I wanted to let my friend try this cuisine since she hsd never had it before. The decor was really simple yet romantic and cozy. Everything here is self-serve which is a nice touch from the usual wait staff. We were not disappointed in the price and taste and the portions were big enough to share. It honestly tasted home cooked. Here's a list of what we got:Lumpia shanghai (pork springrolls) - came with 6 rolls and they were fresh and the dipping sauce really pulled together the savoury flavour of the dishCombo meal with pork skewers - amazing flavours! There were 2 skewers and the pork was well done - cooked but not dry, it was still tender and juicy. And everything went to well together. This dish csme with salad, 2 eggs, and garlic rice. I thought the rice was a bit dry for my likingAdobo chicken - came with 4 pieces of chicken. The sauce was a bit salty but it went well with the rice that we had already. The chicken was tender and there was flavour in every bite. I liked the fact that they had pieces of red chilli which gave it a nice kick.Ube flan - thicker than flan consistency but the ube flavour really pulled through. The purple colour really stood out on its own but when it was served with crunchy granola it was really eye popping! The granola gave it a nice crunch which was fun to eat\",\"I've passed this place quite a few times on my way down Queen West and it always struck me. Superficially it was the decor. I love a place that looks cozy and quaint and Stelvio definitely does.They specialize in Northern Italian cuisine and it's a nice change from the standard run of the mill Italian food that restaurants usually have on their menus. I love the authenticity mixed with high-class dishes and plating. We were seated right away upon arriving, which was great, despite it being a Friday night.We ordered the sciatt (basically fried cheese balls from heaven). It's the perfect appetizer for any deep fried lover. The polenta fritters were perfectly fried, while the cheese had the most amazing melt-factor. I couldn't believe what I was tasting. For my main I ordered the tagliatelle ai funghi porcini and again, absolutely amazing. I love that the pasta is homemade in-house and the ingredients used I could just tell were of the freshest quality. I would definitely recommend this place! Not only is the decor amazing, giving it this cute and cozy vibe but the food exceeds what you'd think. Stelvio isn't just a pretty face on Queen West, the food actually does the talking. This would also be a prime spot for a date night. Next time you're in the mood for Italian food but are tired of the same-y menus everywhere under the sun, hit this place up, you'll be taken on a culinary journey, exploring the Italian north.\",\"If you want to experience omakase, this is the place you have to go! The restaurant itself is super small and you'll be eating in a very intimate setting (a little less than 20 seats in the restaurant). Seating is either around the bar or on the tables about 2 feet away from the bar. I would definitely go with bar seating for the full experience. Right off the bat you'll be treated by the servers and the sushi chefs and they'll give you their full attention throughout the serving. I was given the option of choosing between the regular omakase and and upgrade to premium sashimi for an extra $25. I figured if I'm spending $110 anyways, an extra $25 couldn't hurt. With the premium upgrade, I was served toro sashimi, uni and scallop. The sashimi and all the seafood that followed was extremely fresh and clean (to taste). It's impossible to expect what seafood you'll be served that night as omakase plates depend on seasonality. However during my visit I had to opportunity to try such nigiris as monk fish liver, stripejack, mackerel, uni, and red shrimp. With each dish the servers or sushi chef will explain the food being presented in front of you, where it came from and how to eat it. We finished the nigiri selection with beautifully sweet tamago and fragrant black sesame ice cream. My favourite for the night was the monkfish liver nigiri, the shiso and ponzu daikon helped cut through the heaviness of the liver. I was also surprised with the shirako as I expected the slimy texture to be off putting but it wasn't and almost dissolved in your mouth. They tell you is \\\"a part of cod\\\" without any further description and I wouldn't advise googling which part unless you are truly curious. Overall a great experience and I would definitely come back without hesitation if it were a special occasion. One of a must try's for sushi lovers and a \\\"have to do try it once\\\" experience for all foodies.\",\"I've lived in the area for almost 10 years and just now found this hidden gem! The food is fresh and so tasty. I had a curry soup which was made from scratch - fantastic! The Turkey Intern sandwich was the best sandwich I've had in years. All topped off with a chocolate chip cookie with a pretzel on top. Divine!Highly recommend this place. Service was perfect. Music great. Food exquisite!!\",\"As soon as I walked in I was treated like FAMILY!The service was outstanding and the middle eastern food was pretty good! I had the whole salmon and it was probably one of the better ones I've eaten. The food is well priced and comes out quickly. Make sure you book a reservation on weekends because sometimes it can be quite busy!\",\"Neat cozy dark long bar with live music on weekends. Although the bar was long and narrow it never felt uncomfortably crowded. They do tequila flights, a sample of 3 and some spicy tomato juice for palette cleansing. It was fun to try the different kinds, figure out which one you like and then order cocktails based on that. Friendly bartenders and hooks to hang coats/bags (a feature not to be underestimated).\",\"Heavy food but delicious. Eclectic decor and friendly staff. Ample seating on two floors. Ordered salmon eggs benny and it was tangy and super filling with scones/ biscuits in replacement of English muffin. I'd come back here again- but on a completely empty stomach.\",\"With a full house at Gyu-Kaku and an estimated wait time of over 45 minutes, we opted for some good old classic Chinese cuisine. The foods we ate did not disappoint! We ordered the House Fried Rice Cakes, the Spare Ribs, Xiao long Bao, Cold Noodles, and Shao Mai. They all were really delicious but the cold noodles really stood out for me. I loved their creamy peanut sauce. It was also slightly sweet. It was great!\",\"Taste: 3Service: 4Value: 3Presentation: 4Overall: 3.5 rounded up to 4Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. Trying out the steak and frites today. My coworker told me they serve godlike fries, possibly her favourite fries of all time. My dish comes with the soco fries so I'm excited to try them.Wow the portion sizes were huge! At least my coworkers' dishes were. I had my 7oz steak but my plate had a lot of fries on it. Trying out the steak, immediately I could tell that it would be disappointing. It wasn't cooked well at all and didn't even taste like steak. But moving onto the feature (lol?), these soco fries were crispy with garlic, parmesan, chopped herbs and caper aioli sprinkled on top. And if that wasn't enough for you, they provide you with a creamy garlic sauce to dip your fries in mmmmmmm! I personally prefer my fries slightly crispier, but I would stand by my coworker's claim that these are the best fries given that. Regardless though, the flavour packed into these fries were utterly addicting. Disclaimer: if you are a vampire I am not responsible for any injury as a result of trying these delicious fries.The service was pretty good throughout our meal. Food came relatively quickly and waiter came periodically to give us refill on water and ask for refills of beer. No complaints there.Now in terms of the value, $26 for steak and fries is quite cheap by Toronto's standards. So, I wasn't extremely surprised by the quality of the steak when it arrived. The portion sizes were huge though and I was quite stuffed. On the other hand, if you only want to try their fries, it's only $7 for an order which is a little bit on the pricier side but well justifies the price in my opinion.In conclusion, don't let the fact that this restaurant is located in a hotel discourage you. I had a great meal here and would be excited to come back for their fries every so often. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!\",\"So you know when you move to a new neighborhood and you accidentally on purpose find yourself at a local spot every night for a week?Well this was that place. Get the burger. Get the empanada. You will dream of both forever and ever until you devour another. I promise. Oh and they have a supreme craft beer tap selection. It's a miracle I haven't moved right into their kitchen. COME HERE.\",\"Absolute gem of a restaurant! Food was amazing and the view was beautiful. Food portions were a little small but other than that, they tasted great and had very nice presentation. I ordered the Great Lakes pickeral and had the apple terrine for dessert.The birch and sunchoke ice cream was PHENOMENAL and would return just for that! Service was amazing as well. Our server was constantly coming to our table to make sure everything was okay and even gave us small tasters (of duck tartare) before our meal came. Staff was super friendly and accommodating. Overall, it was a great restaurant and would definitely return.\",\"I've only had the pleasure of coming here for dessert, and it is amazing. The service is incredible. We were greeted at the door with smiles, the host took our jackets and we sat at our table. The whole restaurant is very very small, it maybe seats 20 people. We had the Cr\\u00e8me Br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e which was amazing, exactly the way it should be. Creamy Creme at the bottom and the top had a perfect crust. Next up... WARNING... The Apple Tarte with Calvados Sabayon. FUCKING PERFECT. This came much later as it takes about 25 minutes to cook. The pastry itself is perfect, buttery and crisp. The thin apples are then topped with the Sabayon which is a custardy sauce that has a bit of liquor. The Combination of flavours is overwhelming. It's a great date spot and I would recommend it.\",\"We love Dagu! The decor is simple and comfortable. The staff is friendly and speedy too! What we love most is the price and what you get. We tried pretty much every single soup and they are all flavorful and packed with toppings. It's such a warm and fuzzy feeling to have a nice bowl of dagu noodles on a winter day. The drinks are pretty standard but the snacks like the Salty Crispy Chicken and Chicken Leg are worth trying out!\",\"Extraordinary. \\u00a0I'm from Montreal and pretty much can't eat Greek food in Toronto overall. \\u00a0I've had some that is half decent compared to Mtl Greek but haven't had a \\\"good\\\" meal out here. \\u00a0Well last night I had a GREAT Greek meal out here!From great people who obviously love what they do. \\u00a0Simple, fresh, homemade (tziziki and pita) and their lamb was noooooo f'n joke at ALL. \\u00a0Some of the best lamb I've ever eaten anywhere and easily some of the best Greek food, and I'm tempted to say the best, that I've had in my life. \\u00a0Top notch. I feel bad giving the review because I don't want them to change what they do at all and expansion sometimes does that. \\u00a0But food this good deserves to be shared so I can't be a selfish a-hole about it. \\u00a0Thus, the 5 star review.If you care about the care put into your food, then put this food into your mouth.If quality is important to you, then show yours - go to Fat Lamb Kouzina.If you're a foodie, (you can even ask Judy) eating here is your duty.Now.... do you see?Great staff, food, and atmosphere. \\u00a0Small, cozy, and super real. \\u00a0Super, natural, maybe supernatural.I got so sidetracked by the food I forgot to mention how engaging the staff are. \\u00a0Really good guys who really love what they do. \\u00a0This is a passion for them and it shows.\",\"Tried this place as my friend lives nearby. We ordered food from there through Just Eat. The food tasted really good. The steak well seasoned and cooked just right. Rice was great and the plantains were a fantastic addition to the dish. Gave my avocado salad to my friend though cuz I dont like cabbage, but I enjoyed the meal. In my opinion it was a good value for the portion and taste I got. Will try this place again and maybe try their other dishes. Recommended if you like hearty latin american food.\",\"Visiting from Honolulu with my co-worker from Los Angeles. We stumbled upon this gem on Yelp. I generally only use Yelp for searching, not for leaving reviews, however I just had to let everyone know how amazing this place was. Service was on point from the moment we walked in without a reservation (which is a big deal since they have such a small capacity).We had the Burrata, Chef's Special and the meatballs over polenta, and we barely spoke to each other until everything was gone. My co-worker likes me more now because of my on point dinner selection haha! Love this place, wish I could bring t back to Hawaii with me!\",\"I was told to check this place out by one of my chef friends that used to cook with DaiLo's owner back in Australia. All I can say is I'm glad we finally have food this good in Canada. This place is a great addition to college street... different from all the Italian spots.The dishes here are fun, sexy, flavorful and fresh. Great date spot or good spot for small groups. Everything is basically family style. Get 2-3 dishes per person or so and share them all. There's also a nice bar upstairs. Menu changes with the season.\",\"I could eat that peking duck pizza every day.The pastas were delicious, and in generous portions. They are carb-heavy (I would have liked a bit more veggies and sauce), but overall quite delicious. We each ordered a pasta and shared it 3-ways. I recommend this since the same flavor might get old.Nice modern decor, the restaurant is a long/skinny type of layout. Overall, great place for a chill dinner with some asian-italian fusion menu items. Would come back with friends.\",\"Amazing food. I've been many times and have never been disappointed and have ALWAYS loved everything I've tried. It's a great vibe and the owner/chef is awesome - he always comes out to talk to us and see how we're doing and remembers us.\",\"Ugghghghghg Lake Inez. Like, how are you this constantly delicious and WONDERFUL!?I was here again (second time, though frankly it should be my 222nd time) to celebrate the upcoming wedding of my BFF (that was also kinda the reason we first went there as well, actually). Anyhoo, I had some requests, as you often do before a small bachelorette type thing, and the staff were so friggin' wonderful and awesome. So before I even stepped foot inside, and opened my mouth to shove food in it, I was reminded about how great this place is. The service is solid and exceptional!So the food - SO GOOD. Not a single bad dish. Everything was ridiculously delicious. We ordered:Japanese Deviled Eggs - so good, and I even hate roe, but I super did not care, it was DELICIOUS.Honey Garlic Adobo Wings - I could live off these for months. Sticky, sweet perfection.Summer Corn Fritter - I've been super into corn lately, and this was really, really, really good.Housemade Spam \\\"Oshizushi\\\" - I think this was my favourite of the night. Everything was glorious, the flavours, the textures, all of it.Spicy Charred Broccoli - Superb, and it made me feel like I was being healthy. Winning combo!Salmon \\\"Sinigang\\\" - OMG the coconut polenta! SHUT UP AND GET IN MY MOUTH. The salmon was great too. BUT THE POLENTA.Sichuan-Style Lamb Pappardelle - Really good, but maybe the least loved of all the dishes. I mean we ate it all and it was delicious, but we didn't scrape all the bits from the plate into our mouths. Mushroom Pasta thing - ugh, so cheesy and good and creamy and mushroom-y and delicious.Roti - it was fine. Everyone else was all OMG THE ROTIIII, but I was all, meh it's tasty!We also drank the Nicholas Pearce 2015 Brut, which was lovely! And the Southbrook orange wine, which was really weird and interesting!Anyhoo, it was delicious, and I need to go back to eat there 507 more times. At least. And I live close by, so I'm not sure why I'm not there RIGHT NOW.\",\"Everything at Kiin was aesthetically pleasing - Every dish was vibrant and interesting. Flavours were light, refreshing, and often with a nice spice factor.Starting with Thai Iced Teas, $6 - Tried the Pandan (meh) and the Matoom (enjoyed this, tastes like banana leaves). Roy Thai, $16 - Must. Order. Four kinds of distinctive 'dumplings' - each with its own flair. \\u00a0Khao Yum, $24 - Brimming with a multitude of herbs, spices, and ingredients. Super fresh and had a good kick to it.Mieng Pla, $36 - Tasty and well portioned sea bream wraps that played on different textures. \\u00a0Highly enjoyed the modern, experimental Thai food experience and would come again to try more dishes.\",\"I LOVE this middle eastern restaurant! It`s so good!!This place is tapa style, you order a couple dishes and share it with the table. If you don`t have any background knowledge in the food from the area, you`ll probably have difficulty knowing exactly what you`re ordering. Food looks pretty simple, they aren`t going to serve it to you with the fancy French designs that you don`t want to ruin. It`s straight up food in a bowl or plate. Although I did find them to be on the saltier side, everything we ordered were so delicious. They also had wine from the middle east, which I never even heard of. You can tell a very distinct difference between them and a Cali or Italian wine.Our server, and everyone else was eager to explain just about everything, or just checking up on the table. Fantastic service and food.\",\"Finally! Found the perfect Korean restaurant. Greeted from the second we walked in. The place was very busy and was expecting a bit of a wait. Thankfully a table opened up immediately and was sat down quickly. The hostess very prompt in her service and ensured that we had both tea and water at the table. Ordered the pan fried veggie dumplings, tofu bibimbop and the pork bones soup. Without getting into too much detail, the portion size was huge and the flavours were spot on. The pan fried dumpling were amazing. The Crispin was and flavours were absolutely perfect. This place is my new go to Korean in Korea time!\",\"Decided to try this place out with a friend for the first time. When I walked in, the decor was really nice. I went for brunch around 1pm so the place was not busy.The menu had some really interesting items, I think I want to come back and try the dinner menu next time. But I tried their chicken and egg waffles, and their kimchi and pork eggs benedict. Both were incredibly delicious! I loved the egg waffles and chicken more.Great service, great food. Prices are reasonable! Would definitely recommend for those who wants to try out some Korean fusion. They got a lot of kimchi items for their dishes.\",\"I am always craving Trattoria Taverniti, which sucks for my boyfriend because every time he wants to make Italian food, I just rather go to Trattoria. Everything they have to offer is incredibly delicious and reasonably priced. The staff is sweet and the decor is beautifully quaint. Trattoria Taverniti is filled with loads of charm and is perfect for a nice, relaxing night out. If you plan on going during the weekend, it may be a good idea to reserve beforehand so that you don't have to wait for a seat considering the place doesn't fit many people!Their wine selection isn't that great but good enough for a glass to accompany your yummy Italian food. It just breaks my heart that they do not offer a cool wine list from their specific region of Italy (I would literally be there every night if that were the case). I hope you enjoy this lovely restaurant as much as I do!\",\"We came for a friends birthday on a weekday. The place wasn't crowded and this is definitely one of the better Mexican restaurants in Toronto. The food had a lot of flavour, staff were very friendly. I will be coming back here again! The only negative comment is that I wish they had more vegetarian options.\",\"So delicious and soo cheap! My favourite is the tofu with the beef!!! The broth it's in is soo flavourful and the tofu is the perfect texture! When you mix it with your rice it's the most satisfying meal in the world!They only take debit or credit for bills over $15 which is a bummer since all their menu items are under $15. But the past two times I went the servers were super friendly and happy to let me pay debit when my meal came under $15\",\"This little gem has become our go to spot for a cozy night out with great food. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Never disappoints.\",\"The Ace is our go to spot for brunch for the friendly staff and the mouth watering food!We honestly have never been disappointed with anything on their menu, but if it's your first time I'd recommend the BLT (add egg), the banana blueberry French toast, or the Croque Madame. If you find yourself with some home fries or anything else thats a vehicle for aggressive dipping ask for their dill mayo What makes us come back so regularly is that the experience goes beyond the food. Everyone who works here is always so friendly! And seeing the chef at work with such a buzzing energy is always great to see. You really feel like there's a lot of love that goes into her cooking. Anytime we have friends or family visiting, we take them here because it's consistently such an enjoyable experience.Hands down, best brunch in roncey / parkdale / high park!\",\"Very nice environment. Nice music and cozy street.Authentic Thai food with food service. Lots people come for takeout too.Definitely a good pick!Recommended.\",\"This is a casual, relaxed place that is nice for dates and catching up with old friends. Definitely a great spot for seafood. The service was good. Our waiter was bubbly, energetic and provided honest recommendations. The restaurant was fairly busy so the service was not as fast but there was only 1 waiter at the time so it's understandable. We went there in the summertime so ate on the patio. It's a small establishment with an intimate feel. The food took a long time to come out but there were only one or two chefs at the back so we weren't surprised. The menu and cuisine is simple but still effective. You get decent portions for your money and quality ingredients. Don't expect huge portions of food..this isn't your local \\\"boys night out sports bar pub n grub\\\" okay ;). Would not recommend this restaurant/bar for big groups. The decor/ambience is minimalistic and just as simple as their menu but still aesthetically pleasing. If you're the foodie photo taker type you'll definitely be able to snap some nice shots. Personally, I find this simple classic style to be a bit elegant and romantic. Yup I dig it! The grilled octopus was super delicious. Just thinking about it right now if making my mouth water.\",\"This is an excellent and completely authentic restaurant. Even the waitress comes from France. I have the feeling that the French owner is on site everyday which is always a good sign.The service is attentive and very well informed.The wine list is classic, classy and reasonable. (We had an outstanding 2015 Pouilly Fume).We started with a lovely Frissee salad with apple and blue cheese and a rich mustard seed dressing: Great flavours and textures. The fish of the day was cod in a crispy crusting which again had wonderful flavours and good textures, accompanied by soft red peppers. We ended with the lamb shank which was beautifully spiced and herbed and tender, surrounded by fresh Romano beans in a rich brown sauce. The home-made fries came with a dusting of tarragon.All was delicious.\",\"I love this place. It's one of our go-to restaurants when my and my husband are feeling like a bite, but don't want to go too far. I really don't understand the not-so-great reviews, because we have been here at least 6-7 times and have had really good experiences that keep us coming back. The ambience in the restaurant is nice - a bit dark and romantic in the evening. The tables are small, but it reminds of a bit of a crowded bistro. I also love the covered patio during the summer - it has a nice view overlooking the ROM. We normally have pretty good service and the food comes out quite fast. Sometimes our server may not be the friendliest, but the service is prompt, polite and efficient. Most importantly, we always have full drinks and the food comes out right!!!The prime beef double cheeseburger ($19) here is, dare I say it, one of my all-time favourite burgers ever. I think it even outshines Richmond Station's burger (which is really saying something). It is a small burger in diameter, but packed with deliciousness. Two juicy patties, American cheese, very thinly sliced red onion and pickles on a fresh bun? You can't go wrong. The fries here are always on point too - they are piping hot, crisp and just delicious. I would also recommend the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich ($18). This is served with a generous piece of chicken, and a spicy adobo mayo. I have also tried the ginger steak salad, which was not particularly good. The steak was a bit chewy and the salad didn't pack the punch I expected. I guess that's what you get for trying to order a salad....Honestly, the worst meal we had here was during Summerlicious 2017. My husband ordered off the menu, and he got the fried chicken sandwich, the duck buns and a butter tart (if I remember correctly). We have had the fried chicken sandwich before, and he said it wasn't as good. Maybe this is because of the large amount of food the restaurant is pumping out during Summerlicious? I'm not sure. Either way, we will continue coming back for the regular menu!\",\"Was there with 7 people on a Sunday afternoon. Made reservation for lunch although when I got there there wasn't too many people and there are plenty of tables so really didn't need a resrvation. \\u00a0Inside is redesigned and very nice e and modern. Even the parking lot is new.We ordered a cold platter app which comes with 4 cold apps and bread. Also got a huge mixed platter of meats to share as well as a pide \\u00a0and extra skewers of grille meat. Followed by kenefe and tea. Gotta say thay that overall the food was great. The meats were grilled perfectly were juice and tender. The fresh bread is very nice. The cold humus babaganoush potato salad and eggplant was very nice and plentiful for us to share. The fires and rice on the side are good as well. Overall this place serves pretty decent middle eastern food compared to other spots. My favourite dish is the kinafe. It's much better than other places I've had it. This place is a good place to host people or come for an occasion but definitely not one for daily Turkish eating. There are cheaper Turkish options out there with similar food. But again for the quality of food and ambience and service the pretty penny is worth it.\",\"This place is awesome! I came here for dinner with a group of friends on Friday night. \\u00a0This restaurant is very small, \\u00a0so I highly suggest making reservations. I would say they can at max accommodate 8 people, \\u00a0but it might be tight. \\u00a0We were a party of 7 people. \\u00a0This location is relatively close to the subway and for people that drive, \\u00a0there is street parking and a Green P parking lot across the street too. \\u00a0The servers here are friendly and nice. \\u00a0I like that they constantly came to refill our water glasses without having to ask. \\u00a0But they weren't over attentive either. Because it is a very small restaurant, \\u00a0it is not very noisy although they are very busy. We decided to order dishes and a bottle of red to share. \\u00a0The bottle was not expensive at all... \\u00a0I thought it was very afforable. \\u00a0The food here is delicious!! \\u00a0I think I have found a new Thai Restaurant to frequent. The presentation of the food was pretty, \\u00a0the flavors were good. \\u00a0My favorite dishes I think was their signature Pad Thai and the Pineapple Fried Rice. \\u00a0The Pad Thai they use a very thin noodle which is different from most Pad Thai I've had elsewhere. All the prices on their menu are all afforable. \\u00a0I am so coming back for more Thai food!!! \\u00a0I think I am in love.... \\u00a0 Lol....\",\"Finally made it over here, and I'm glad I did. Met with a friend, and made reservations for a weekday, as they still are rather busy. For drinks, I had the Sofia Loren I believe, and it was a nice drink to start, but just a little too sweet for my palette. We ordered a bottle of their pinot Nero, which I had never heard of before. It was so delicious! Not overly sweet or dry, and chilled to perfection. I find red wine can make me feel very sleepy if I'm having it with a larger meal. We ordered the antipasto to start. I did enjoy what I had, but maybe would have preferred more cheese and meat than vegetables. For my main, I had the ravioli which was fantastic! It wasn't like 4 tiny pieces that you get at other places. This was a very filling dish that wasn't heavy, and full of flavour. I also am a sucker for truffles. My friend got the veal special and loved it. Now I would have given this place a 4, but the service was amazing! Raf was our waitress and was cracking jokes with us all night. She came with me downstairs to the bathroom as I am on crutches and offered to help me inside. She honestly made the experience memorable, and I hope the restaurant does read this, as she deserves a lot of credit.\",\"We didn't know this spot was vegan only, but were pleasantly surprised by the outcome ! The stir fried vegetables with vermicelli and tofu was very tasty and did not taste or look too oily or heavy ! The imitation chicken was also very good ! There was barely a difference in taste ! If you are looking for a healthier option or are strictly vegan or vegetarian this restaurant is a great option ! It is also very close to Kensington market, which is always a fun area.\",\"This place is amazing when you need the ultimate comfort food!!! It's so cozy and warm, and the service is impeccable!We were greeted right away by the bartender, and then sat at a table where we were served by Adrian. Adrian was so welcoming and inviting. We had the fried cauliflower, liver pat\\u00e9, and the gnocchi to start and all were delicious!!We then had the veggie burger (which was so tasty), regular cheeseburger... OMG!!!! , and the Korean fried chicken thigh sandwich... The sauce was so rich and incredible.Ultimately- this place is my go to for a comfort food binge night. Their macaroni and cheese is dangerously delicious!\",\"I went to Sotto Sotto tonight for dinner with my husband. It was his 36th birthday. This was hands down the best experience I've ever had at any restaurant. We made resos and were promptly taken to our table as we walked in. The service was totally on point. Our servers name was Frank. He was sooo good and honestly checked in just enough times to make sure we didn't need anything. We ordered the share platter app, I had the mushroom pasta and my husband had the salmon pasta. For dessert we had the cannoli and melted lava cake with a latte. I can't tell you how delicious the food was. Hands down the best pasta we've ever had. The ambiance, the lighting and the service was all top notch. I would highly recommend this place and am gonna add this to a regular spot for date nights !! Loved it.\",\"Just ate at this place..Amazing service and amazing food. We ordered the meat special. It comes with all of the meat selections. The portion is way too big for two people. We are packing our back packing. Love it. Su Gud.\",\"Came here as a cold walk-in and was pleasantly surprised. It's a cramped space with only a few chairs available, so perhaps plan accordingly. I had the fish and chicken tacos. For starters, the tacos are quite large, so 2 could easily fill you up. Ingredients were fresh and well distributed so as to not slip out of the tortillas. Batter around the fish was not overwhelming. Chicken was tender and flavorful. Overall I'd recommend this place for a quick bite.\",\"Hands down the best Korean food I've had in the GTA / Toronto area. Overall, the prices are very fair and the service is great. The seafood pancakes here are fluffy and a must get every time I go, especially to share. The kalbi is also a good option to share amongst friends.Chaban's bibimbap and pork bone soup, despite being classic Korean meals, are comparably somehow just way better than all the others that I've tried in the province. For a more broth like soup that's not too heavy but still flavourful, try the oxtail bone soup. It's perfect for a chilly day.No matter what you pick though, it's probably going to be delicious. Also available for delivery for anyone who lives near the Etobicoke region. They even take AMEX which is a bonus.\",\"Tried the Cheese Dakgalbi with added ramen. So tasty! They put a nice amount of cheese, however there was barely any rice cakes. \\u00a0Also tried the bibimbap which was good as well!Food came out really fast. Great for the price and quality. Will be back for sure!!\",\"I have visited The Loose Moose on multiple occasions. Whether it was after a conference, before the Jays game or a concert, or just hanging out with friends, The Moose has been a good centralized location with fairly consistent service. making it one of my favourite places in the Front/University area. I don't recall ever having bad service here. They usually know if you go at a certain time, you're probably just stopping by for a quick bite and drink before a game or a show, so the food comes out pretty quickly. Just because the food comes out quickly doesn't mean quality of food suffers either. Oh, and they also play pretty good music here too!Honestly, I think their menu is much better than the neighbouring Jack Astor's, so if you're in the area, go to The Moose!\",\"This is such a cute place in Kensington Market! The back patio is super adorable, and you may have some extra friends--raccoons! The food and drinks are tasty. The atmosphere is kinda romantic. There's a weird trailer in the back with a table in it if you wanted to be hidden away. Staff here are friendly. This is such a cute spot I'm definitely coming back in the summer, though their interior looks cozy for cold weather too.\",\"My favourite spot for ramen in TO! This location is close to Bloor-Yonge station and right by my school. I come here a lot and service has always been consistently good. I have always received my food within 10 minutes of placing my order. The servers are diligent and attentive. I always go for the Tonkotsu Black or the Miso Black (the garlic oil is delicious). I personally didn't like the Spicy Tan-Tan ramen. The venue is small so there's always a chance you'll be sharing a table with someone. FYI, They take cash, debit, and credit.\",\"I was a little apprehensive because I love tacos SO much and didn't want to get my hopes up. Thankfully Campechano is awesome. The restaurant is nice and cozy with super loud music that didn't irritate me for some reason and only accepts cash and debit.The earliest reservation I could make online was for 9:45 pm on a Saturday and we were out of there in 35 minutes! I would recommend making a reservation as they were a lot of people waiting for tables on our way out.The food came out as it was prepared and they timed it perfectly so my husband and I each had a plate in front of us. The tacos were just so good - juicy meat, perfectly seasoned sauces, the right amount of messiness. I'm so in love with these tacos.My ranking from what I tried this visit: beef cheek (juicy and flavourful), campechano (I love chicharon), pescado (perfectly deep fried fish, salty sauces) and the sope without meat (kind of whatever except for the nice soft, doughy base). My husband said the barbacoa was his favourite but he didn't order the beef cheek so what does he know? :PWe ordered two cocktails - pina mojito and spicy margarita - and then shared them because each was good and went well with some tacos over others. The pina mojito goes well with the lamb tacos and is as equally refreshing as the spicy margarita (yes, it's SPICY).With two cocktails, seven tacos and one sope the bill with tip was around $80.We will definitely come back for a chill date night, small birthday party or to try out the patio in the summer.\",\"My girlfriend and I had brunch at the Pow Wow Caf\\u00e9 on a chilly Saturday afternoon. The vibe is extremely cozy and casual, with the kitchen centrally placed and wide open to the five or so tables in front of the window. There is apparently another dining room in the back but I did not see it. There is a reasonably roomy patio in front but at -15C that was not an option today.I was seated right beside the chef/owner and enjoyed watching him gracefully and rhythmically prepare our food and that of the tables who ordered just before us. And when our food arrived it did not disappoint. My girlfriend had the poached eggs with smoked salmon which she rated 5/5. I had the brunch platter including duck bacon, venison and a little smoked cheddar omelette, which I also graded a 5/5. In fact my plate was so close to the chef that just after it was placed in front of me and before I had dug in, he piroutted, and without taking a step, and expertly dropped my little venison burger onto my plate in just the right spot from his spatula, mentioning that he had missed before the waitress had grabbed it. Both our plates came with ample portions of really really good, moist, homefries and exotic greenery with a zesty dressing and nice touches like flower petals and julienned veggies of what type I cannot recall. Neither of us could finish our portions, but note well that the fried bread which appears to be a focus for a lot of the menu did not go unfinished on either of our plates. Oh and a fresh fruit medley of blueberries, pineapple, honeydew melon and grapefruit. It was a feast. Somewhere in the description of the plates needs to include the word \\\"flourish\\\". It could go just about anywhere.The staff were jovial and numerous, gathered in the kitchen eating takeout from McDonalds, a deliciously ironic juxtaposition to the wholesome and earthy food they were making for the rest of us. Even funnier, they washed it down with a communal birthday toast of organic ginger juice. Then it got better again - a customer asked them whose birthday it was and one of them replied that it was none of theirs, but it must be someone's birthday. There were about six of them crammed into the little kitchen area and honestly I would not be surprised if a couple of them were not actually working but came in to hang out on their day off because they enjoyed being there with their chums. But their camaraderie in no way interfered with the attentive service as I have seen it do in other such instances.We are both looking forward to going back to try a few things from the dinner menu!\",\"We called in a pickup order shortly after they opened on a Saturday and it was ready 15 minutes later (lots of parking across the street FYI). \\u00a0The food was absolutely delicious. \\u00a0We order the 1/2lb of pulled pork, 1/2lb of brisket and potato wedges (~$36 total). \\u00a0We thought the portions looked small when we opened everything up but we were absolutely stuffed after the two of us ate half the food.The brisket was some of the best I've ever had. \\u00a0It was so juicy and tender, with good chunks of fat still attached. \\u00a0The pork melted in your mouth. \\u00a0And the potato wedges were soooooo good. \\u00a0Crispy on the oustide, fluffy on the inside, perfectly seasoned and gigantic! \\u00a0The sauce was great too.Can't wait to come back to try some of the other items. \\u00a0I was very impressed!\",\"Quality AYCE sushi and dim sum, with an iPad ordering system and fast and attentive service. I visited this location on a late Sunday afternoon, and was seated right away. Luckily the lunch AYCE menu ran until about 3:30pm.4/5 - Venue5/5 - Food4/5 - OverallVenue: The location is clean and well kept, with obvious signs of renovation, just don't expect a modern or high end experience. The seating is spacious, with booth seats and tables alike. There is also a small bar available, with a selection of Canadian classics, and imports like various sakes or Chinese beers. The only downside is that the tile floors really pool up the winter snow and slush, and can lead to a pretty dirty floor.Food: The sushi here will NOT disappoint. The fish is fresh, and an obvious step up from your typical AYCE sushi joint. The salmon is buttery and tender, and the butterfish is very smooth as well. None of the tough fish that you can sometimes get at AYCE sushi. The dim sum is not bad as well, though I do suspect that not everything is fresh or made in-house. The tempura is light and crisp, and the sushi rolls are well made, and presentation is not poor. Come for the fish, it's worth it.Overall: One unique aspect is that the ordering system is through an iPad, so there's no need to flag down a waiter, or to repeat a long list of items to them. All our food that was ordered arrived in a timely fashion, though I expect times to be slower during peak hours. The waiter was very accommodating for our vegan friend, and the kitchen happily accepted sushi that incorrectly had mayo in it, and remade it to order. Great service for an AYCE restaurant, and great value at about $22 for lunch.\",\"Having wanting to try this for ages, we decided to bite the bullet and do it as part of my boyfriend's Christmas present. \\u00a0And boy, were we in for an experience. \\u00a0First off, you dined in a pretty private room mainly because they only serve 3 tables a night, staggered. \\u00a0Our service was led by Kei Hashimoto who was courteous, professional, and extremely knowledgeable. \\u00a0Every single course was mind blowing and flavours danced in your mouth in every possible way. \\u00a0Kei explained every single course in great detail discussing what exactly the ingredients were and where they were sourced from. \\u00a0A lot of our foods were imported from Japan. \\u00a0Two of my favourite courses were the wagyu course and the dessert, where we got THE melon. \\u00a0At the end of our meal, Kei asked us if we had time to join the tea ceremony. \\u00a0We were led into a separate tea room and given a glimpse of how sacred a tea ceremony could be. \\u00a0It was serene, peaceful, and enlightening. \\u00a0Kaiseki Yu Zen Hashimoto is definitely not an everyday place to go to but if you have that special occasion, it is definitely worth the visit. \\u00a0We will definitely be back because at $800, it was a way better experience than Nobu (see my Nobu HK review).\",\"Excellent dining experience at Chantecler! I will be going back for sure... It's a small place and it can get busy, reservations are highly encouraged...We ordered the following and I would recommend them all:SALMON SPECIALHALF DUCK (chive pancakes, duck gravy, plum sauce)TUNA SALAD (seared tuna, beets, fennel, sour cream & horseradish)RATATOUILLE (zucchini, eggplant, peppers, pesto)FRENCH FRIES (lemon & mayonnaise)\",\"Indie is a Junction gem. My husband and I are both craft beer snobs and we're consistently impressed with the selection and taste. Neither of us are a fan of hoppy beers and there is always a great variety of beer varieties for every palate. In fact so much so, that I virtually always want to get a flight so I can try all the beers that sound interesting.Although I've ordered food here far fewer times than I've ordered beer, the dishes I have tried have been delicious. The bison and belly burger was juicy and filling, the French onion soup warmed my belly and tasted so fresh and wholesome. The duck pizza is also super tasty! The atmosphere is cozy and overall it's a great place to meet friends for a casual dinner and drinks.\",\"Love Morgans. Real excellence in food. They care. They're friendly. The food is good and so are the drinks!!!!\",\"This is definitely one of the most underrated taco joints in the city. Strange how this place is located on a pretty prime part of the city yet it's so easy to pass right by without even noticing it. Probably has something to do with the atrocious decor or there-lack-of. Anyhow, this review is more about the food.Homey is what best describes this place. This feels like a joint run by a Mexican family cooking up some very homey meals. Their tacos, nachos....etc all have a made-at-home kind of feel to it. No fancy plating and unnecessary garnishes. Just straight to the point, flavourful and delicious stuff. The best part is the prices are pretty cheap when compared to other taco places in the city. Value aside, it's their no-frills, un-adulterated way of preparing the food that separates them from the rest of the other taco places in the city. Meats are well seasoned and nicely caramelized, veggies are on point and the proportions of the components are almost perfectly done. There's no spilling of meat and veggies as you bite into the tacos with sauces squirting out in every direction. It seems as though it was very well thought out and eating their tacos doesn't require a bib like most places do.The tacos here remind me of the many fantastic taco stands I had out in the west coast (LA) run by hard working Mexican families using home-made recipes. If ever I am craving tacos this is definitely my go-to in the city.\",\"Why have I not tried this sooner? Was in the area and I discovered that Banh Mi Boys is amazing. First off the store ambiance is great. Seating, cleanliness and a view of the food preparation area. When I went it wasn't too crowded (11:30ish) but I believe lines form around 12:30 until 2. Nonetheless, they seem fast and efficient. The menu is awesome and great pricing! I love how the menu has vegetarian options in each area too, that's a major plus for me. Decided on tofu fries and a Panko crusted tofu bao. my order was ready very swiftly. The tofu fries were delicious...basically kimchi fries but instead of pulled pork they substitute with tofu. This is incredibly filling...I was not able to finish the entire box. The tofu bao was delicious too!! Lightly fried Panko crusted tofu with Sriracha and fresh veggies....mmmm so good!! And the prices are so reasonable! I'll definitely be back soon.\",\"One of the best bars in the neighborhood!Sit yourself down at the bar for a pint.They have a good selection of cider and beer in tap. The sour beer isn't always available but they have lots to choose from.I'm a fan of County cider and they have a rotation. As for food - I like the fries with housemade ketchup. I can't say I'm blown away by the other items I've tried, but they still hit the spot!This place has a chill vibe and I like
